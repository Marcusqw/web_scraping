The application for a partial stay presented to <span class=\"smallcaps\">Justice Kavanaugh</span> in No. 24A79 and by him referred to the Court is denied.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Department of Education recently issued a new rule implementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.  The rule newly defined sex discrimination to “includ[e&nbsp;] discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.”  <a aria-label=\"89 FR 33886\" href=\"/rio/citation/89_FR_33886\">89 Fed. Reg. 33886</a> (2024).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Several States and other parties sought preliminary injunctions against the new rule, arguing among other things that the rule exceeded the bounds of the statutory text enacted by Congress.  District Courts in Louisiana and Kentucky agreed with the plaintiffs and preliminarily enjoined enforcement of the rule in the plaintiff States.  The &nbsp;Courts of Appeals for the Fifth and Sixth Circuits then declined to stay the injunctions in the interim period while those courts consider the Government’s appeals of the preliminary injunctions.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Government has now filed emergency applications in this Court seeking partial stays of the preliminary injunctions pending resolution of the appeals in the Fifth and Sixth Circuits.  The Court denies the Government’s applications.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Importantly, all Members of the Court today accept that the plaintiffs were entitled to preliminary injunctive relief as to three provisions of the rule, including the central provision that newly defines sex discrimination to include discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.  But the Government argues (and the dissent agrees) that those provisions should be severed and that the other provisions of the new rule should still be permitted to take effect in the interim period while the Government’s appeals of the preliminary injunctions are pending in the Courts of Appeals.  The lower courts concluded otherwise because the new definition of sex discrimination is intertwined with and affects many other provisions of the new rule.  Those courts therefore concluded, at least at this preliminary stage, that the allegedly unlawful provisions are not readily severable from the remaining provisions.  The lower courts also pointed out the difficulty that schools would face in determining how to apply the rule for a temporary period with some provisions in effect and some enjoined.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In this emergency posture in this Court, the burden is on the Government as applicant<em> </em>to show, among other things, a likelihood of success on its severability argument and that the equities favor a stay.  On this limited record and in its emergency applications, the Government has not provided this Court a sufficient basis to disturb the lower courts’ interim conclusions that the three provisions found likely &nbsp;to be unlawful are intertwined with and affect other provisions of the rule.  Nor has the Government adequately identified which particular provisions, if any, are sufficiently independent of the enjoined definitional provision and thus might be able to remain in effect.  Moreover, related to the equities, the Sixth Circuit has already expedited its consideration of the case and scheduled oral argument for October.  The Court expects that the Courts of Appeals will render their decisions with appropriate dispatch.  In light of all of the circumstances, the Court denies the Government’s applications for partial stays.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both forcejy-right\"><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"dissent\">&nbsp;<hr>TOP\n<h2>Dissent</h2>\n<div class=\"bodytext\">\n<p class=\"scusnameplate jy-center\">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p class=\"rule jy-center\">_________________</p>\n<p class=\"casenumber jy-center\">No. 24A78</p>\n<p class=\"rule jy-center\">_________________</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-a jy-center\">DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, <span class=\"smallcaps\">et&nbsp;al</span>. <em>v.</em> &nbsp;LOUISIANA, <span class=\"smallcaps\">et&nbsp;al</span>.</p>\n<h4 class=\"sylct-b sc-1 jy-center\">on application for stay</h4>\n<p class=\"rule jy-center\">_________________</p>\n<p class=\"casenumber jy-center\">No. 24A79</p>\n<p class=\"rule jy-center\">_________________</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-a jy-center\">MIGUEL CARDONA, SECRETARY OF EDUCATION, <span class=\"smallcaps\">et&nbsp;al</span>. <em>v.</em> TENNESSEE, <span class=\"smallcaps\">et&nbsp;al</span>.</p>\n<h4 class=\"sylct-b sc-1 jy-center\">on application for stay</h4>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"opiniondates\">[August 16, 2024]</div>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"casct-a jy-both\"><span class=\"smallcaps\"> Justice Sotomayor</span>, with whom <span class=\"smallcaps\">Justice Kagan</span>, <span class=\"smallcaps\">Justice Gorsuch</span>, and <span class=\"smallcaps\">Justice Jackson</span> join, dissenting in part from the denial of applications for stays.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Respondents challenged a Department of Education rule implementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.  Respondents contend that the rule unlawfully redefines sex discrimination; that it violates students’ and employees’ rights to bodily privacy and safety; and that its definition of hostile environment harassment is inconsistent with the statute and violates the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>.  Every Member of the Court agrees respondents are entitled to interim relief as to three provisions of that Rule: <a aria-label=\"34 CFR\" href=\"/cfr/text/34\">34</a> CFR §106.10 (2023) (defining sex discrimination), §106.31(a)(2) (prohibiting schools from preventing individuals from accessing certain sex-separated spaces consistent with their gender identity), and §106.2’s definition of hostile environment harassment.  Respondents’ alleged injuries flow from those three provisions.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Today, however, a majority of this Court leaves in place &nbsp;preliminary injunctions that bar the Government from enforcing the entire rule—including provisions that bear no apparent relationship to respondents’ alleged injuries.  Those injunctions are overbroad.  To be sure, this litigation is still unfolding, and respondents might eventually show injuries from the other portions of the rule.  If so, those injuries might merit further relief.  For now, on the briefing and record currently before us, I would stay the preliminary injunctions except as to the three provisions above, in keeping with the traditional principle of equitable remedies that “relief afforded [to] the plaintiffs” must not “be more burdensome than necessary to redress the complaining parties.”<em>  Califano </em>v. <em>Yamasaki</em>, <a aria-label=\"442 U. S. 682\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/442/682\">442 U.&nbsp;S. 682</a>, 702 (1979); see <em>Madsen </em>v. <em>Women’s Health Center, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"512 U. S. 753\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/512/753\">512 U.&nbsp;S. 753</a>, 765 (1994) (“[An] injunction [should be] no broader than necessary to achieve its desired goals”).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">I</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Title IX provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”  <a href=\"/rio/citation/86_Stat._373\">86 Stat. 373</a>, <a aria-label=\"20 USC 1681 a\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1681#a\">20 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §1681(a)</a>.  Congress charged the Department of Education with “issuing rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability” to “effectuate” Title IX’s antidiscrimination mandate.  §1682.  Pursuant to that authority, in April 2024, the Department issued an omnibus rule amending Title IX’s regulations, set to take effect nationwide on August 1, 2024.  See <a aria-label=\"89 FR 33474\" href=\"/rio/citation/89_FR_33474\">89 Fed. Reg. 33474</a> (2024) (Rule).  The amended provisions of the Rule cover a range of matters, most of which do not reference gender identity discrimination and went unmentioned by respondents.<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Sotomayor Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_4-1\" id=\"DISSENT_4-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; Respondents claim they are harmed by three provisions of the Rule.  First, at <a aria-label=\"34 CFR\" href=\"/cfr/text/34\">34</a> CFR §106.10, the Rule defines “[d]iscrimination on the basis of sex” to “includ[e] discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.”  <a aria-label=\"89 FR 33886\" href=\"/rio/citation/89_FR_33886\">89 Fed. Reg. 33886</a>.  Second, at §106.31(a)(2), the Rule addresses Title IX’s application in sex-separated spaces.  <a aria-label=\"89 FR 33887\" href=\"/rio/citation/89_FR_33887\">89 Fed. Reg. 33887</a>.  The Rule leaves untouched Title IX’s explicit recognition that schools may differentiate between students on the basis of sex in some contexts, such as in assigning dormitories and creating athletic teams.<a aria-label=\"reference 2 of Sotomayor Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_4-2\" id=\"DISSENT_4-2ref\"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a>  Outside those statutory exceptions, however, &nbsp;§106.31(a)(2) states that Title IX generally permits “different treatment or separation on the basis of sex” only to the extent that such differential treatment or separation does not “discriminat[e].&nbsp;.&nbsp;. by subjecting a person to more than de minimis harm.”  Section 106.31(a)(2) further provides that a policy or practice that “prevents a person from participating in an education program or activity consistent with the person’s <em>gender identity</em> subjects a person to more than de minimis harm on the basis of sex.”  (Emphasis added.)  Sections 106.10 and 106.31(a)(2) are the only provisions in the entire Rule that reference “gender identity.”  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Third, at <a aria-label=\"34 CFR\" href=\"/cfr/text/34\">34</a> CFR §106.2, the Rule defines several terms, including “hostile environment harassment.”  <a aria-label=\"89 FR 33884\" href=\"/rio/citation/89_FR_33884\">89 Fed. Reg. 33884</a>.  “Hostile environment harassment” is a prohibited form of sex discrimination that, as defined by the Rule, involves “[u]nwelcome sex-based conduct that, based on the totality of the circumstances, is subjectively and objectively offensive and is so severe or pervasive that it limits or denies a person’s ability to participate in or benefit from the recipient’s education program or activity (<em>i</em>.<em>e</em>., creates a hostile environment).”  <em>Ibid.  </em>Respondents do not object to §106.2’s definitions of other terms within the Rule, such as “complaint,” “disciplinary sanctions,” “elementary school,” and “student.”</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Two groups of States filed suits in two District Courts challenging the new Rule as unlawful.<a aria-label=\"reference 3 of Sotomayor Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_4-3\" id=\"DISSENT_4-3ref\"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></a>  They contend that &nbsp;the Rule unlawfully rewrites Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination to include discrimination based on students’ gender identity.  Respondents further argue that §106.2’s definition of “hostile environment harassment” is unlawful under <em>Davis</em> v. <em>Monroe County Bd. of Ed.</em>, <a aria-label=\"526 U.S. 629\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/526/629\">526 U.&nbsp;S. 629 (1999)</a>, because it waters down the standard for what constitutes actionable sex-based harassment: Title IX complainants can prevail under the Rule by showing the alleged harassment was severe or pervasive (as opposed to both) and do not need to prove that the offending conduct denied them access to educational benefits.  Respondents separately assert that §106.2’s definition of “hostile environment harassment” violates the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> by chilling or compelling speech, including on issues of gender identity.  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Accordingly, when respondents asked the District Courts to preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Rule, they focused on the two provisions concerning gender identity—§§106.10 and 106.31(a)(2)—and §106.2’s definition of “hostile environment harassment.”  Respondents alleged that those three provisions would cause them irreparable harm if the Rule went into effect.  Specifically, they asserted that they would incur unrecoverable costs in complying with those provisions (and a loss of Title IX funding if they failed to do so), that they would lose the right to speak freely on issues such as gender identity, and that they would be unable to enforce existing state laws that conflict with the Rule’s prohibition of gender identity discrimination.  Although respondents’ alleged irreparable harm apparently traces back to just three of the Rule’s provisions, the District Courts preliminarily enjoined the Government from enforcing the entire Rule in all the respondent States.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; After unsuccessful efforts to seek relief from these overbroad injunctions in the lower courts, the Government asks this Court to stay the injunctions in part.  The Government does not contest the continued injunction as to §106.31(a)(2) (regulating access to sex-separated spaces) or §106.2’s definition of hostile environment harassment as applied to gender identity discrimination.  Instead, it asks this Court to stay the injunction as to §106.2’s definition of hostile environment harassment as applied to other forms of sex discrimination, §106.2’s other definitions, §106.10, and the remainder of the Rule’s unchallenged provisions.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">II</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> I would grant most of the Government’s stay requests and leave enjoined only its enforcement of the three challenged provisions.<a aria-label=\"reference 4 of Sotomayor Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_4-4\" id=\"DISSENT_4-4ref\"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup></a>  A preliminary injunction is an “extraordinary” exercise of equitable authority, appropriate only “upon a clear showing” that a party is “entitled to such relief.”  <em>Winter </em>v.<em> Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"555 U. S. 7\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/555/7\">555 U.&nbsp;S. 7</a>, 22 (2008).  To obtain a preliminary injunction, a party must establish, among other things, that it would likely suffer irreparable harm without equitable relief.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Even when a party makes that showing, though, a court must tailor equitable relief to redress the party’s alleged injuries without burdening the defendant more than necessary.  See <em>Madsen</em>, 512 U.&nbsp;S. at 765 (“[An] injunction [should be] no broader than necessary to achieve its desired goals”); <em>Yamasaki</em>, 442 U.&nbsp;S. at 702 (explaining that “relief afforded [to] the plaintiffs” must not “be more burdensome than necessary to redress the complaining parties”).  </p>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Here, respondents’ alleged injuries flow from the challenged provisions.  Even assuming respondents established that those provisions subject them to a threat of irreparable harm, enjoining enforcement of the entire Rule appears to &nbsp;go beyond what was necessary to redress those injuries.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Consider some of the unchallenged provisions.  The Rule requires schools to provide “reasonable modifications” to pregnant students, including but not limited to “breaks during class to express breast milk, breastfeed, or attend to health needs associated with pregnancy or related conditions.”  <a aria-label=\"89 FR 33887\" href=\"/rio/citation/89_FR_33887\">89 Fed. Reg. 33887</a>.  A separate provision prohibits schools from making a preemployment inquiry as to an applicant’s marital status and limits the circumstances under which a school may make a preemployment inquiry as to an applicant’s sex.  <em>Id.</em>, at 33896.  The Rule also mandates that schools prohibit staff and students from retaliating against students who file Title IX complaints, and provides the procedure a school must follow upon receiving a complaint of retaliation.  <em>Ibid.  </em>Those provisions (like many others in the Rule) do not reference gender identity discrimination or hostile environment harassment and bear no apparent relationship to respondents’ alleged injuries.  As litigation over the Rule proceeds, respondents might be able to show those other portions of the Rule will irreparably harm them in a manner justifying further equitable relief.  At this juncture, however, enjoining the application of any other part of the Rule needlessly impairs the Government from enforcing Title IX and deprives potential claimants of protections against forms of sex discrimination not at issue in respondents’ suit.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Respondents maintain that the Government must remain enjoined from enforcing the entire Rule because the challenged provisions “permeate” it.  Respondents fail to explain, however, why enjoining enforcement of the entire Rule at this stage is necessary to redress their alleged injuries.  As an initial matter, many unchallenged provisions (such as those governing preemployment inquiries about an applicant’s marital status or sex and prohibiting pregnancy discrimination) include no reference to gender identity dis&nbsp;crimination or hostile environment harassment.  Respondents offer nothing to justify preventing the Government from enforcing those parts of the Rule.  As for the provisions that do incorporate the Department’s allegedly unlawful definitions of sex-based discrimination and harassment, respondents do not explain how those provisions would injure them while the Government is enjoined from enforcing the disputed definitions.  Take the Rule’s requirement that employees be trained on “[t]he scope of conduct that constitutes sex discrimination under Title IX and this part, including the definition of sex-based harassment.”  <a aria-label=\"89 FR 33886\" href=\"/rio/citation/89_FR_33886\">89 Fed. Reg. 33886</a>.  Even respondents do not argue that the training requirement is itself unlawful.  With the challenged provisions out of the picture, the “scope of conduct” under that training provision would exclude gender identity discrimination and hostile environment harassment, the sources of respondents’ alleged injuries.  If there were any doubt on this score, moreover, the Court could simply have excluded the provision from its stay order.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Respondents further assert that the Rule would be unworkable with the Government enjoined from applying its definition of sex discrimination.  For 50 years, however, Title IX regulations have not defined sex discrimination, and respondents offer no evidence that schools cannot comply with their Title IX obligations without such a definition.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">*  *  *</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> By blocking the Government from enforcing scores of regulations that respondents never challenged and that bear no apparent relationship to respondents’ alleged injuries, the lower courts went beyond their authority to remedy the discrete harms alleged here.  The injunctions this Court leaves in place will burden the Government more than necessary.  The injunctions will also affect the public.  Individuals in the respondent states will be deprived of guidance &nbsp;related to their rights under Title IX, of updates to the processes schools must follow in investigating their complaints of sex discrimination, of protections from retaliation should they file a complaint, and of much more.  On the present record, more tailored relief focused on the three challenged provisions would have redressed respondents’ alleged injuries without depriving the public of the Rule’s other provisions.  Because the majority of this Court nonetheless leaves the overly broad injunctions in place, I respectfully dissent in part.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<h3 class=\"fnheader\">Notes</h3>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_4-1\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Sotomayor Dissent at reference 1\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_4-1ref\">1</a> &nbsp;Those provisions include: a provision requiring access to lactation spaces and “reasonable modifications” for pregnant students, such as restroom breaks, <a aria-label=\"89 FR 33888\" href=\"/rio/citation/89_FR_33888\">89 Fed.

S. 460\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/567/460\">567 U.&nbsp;S. 460</a>, 470 (2012).  Sentencing courts therefore must have “discretion to impose a lesser punishment” on children who commit crimes before they turn 18.  <em>Jones</em> v. <em>Mississippi</em>, <a aria-label=\"593 U. S. 98\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/593/98\">593 U.&nbsp;S. 98</a>, 100 (2021).  An Arizona court sentenced Lonnie Allen Bassett to life without parole for a crime he committed as a juvenile.  At the time Bassett was sentenced, however, Arizona courts had no discretion to impose parole-eligible sentences because the State had completely abolished parole for people convicted of felonies.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Arizona Supreme Court acknowledged that “Bassett was actually ineligible for parole.”  <em>State</em> <em>ex&nbsp;rel. Mitchell </em>v. <em>Cooper</em>, 256 Ariz. 1, ___, 535 P.&nbsp;3d 3, 8 (2023).  Arizona also agrees that “parole-eligibility is constitutionally required,” and that “Arizona law did not provide a parole eligible option at the time of Bassett’s sentencing.”  Brief in Opposition 1, 24.  Nevertheless, the Arizona Supreme Court denied Bassett’s petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This Court’s precedents require a “discretionary sentencing procedure—where the sentencer can consider the defendant’s youth and has discretion to impose a lesser sentence than life without parole.”  <em>Jones</em>, 593 U.&nbsp;S., at 112.  Because Arizona’s sentencing scheme instead mandated &nbsp;life without parole for juveniles, I would grant the petition for certiorari and summarily reverse the judgment below.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">I</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> In 2004, Lonnie Bassett shot and killed two people in Arizona when he was 16.  He was riding in the back seat of a car driven by Frances Tapia when he used a shotgun to shoot Tapia and her boyfriend, who was sitting in the passenger seat.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Bassett was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder.  At the time he was sentenced, defendants convicted of first-degree murder in Arizona received one of two sentences: either (1) “natural life,” under which the defendant was “not eligible for commutation, parole, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or release from confinement on any basis;” or (2) “life,” which required a defendant to serve 25 years before “releas[e] on any basis.”  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann., §13–703(A) (2003); see §§13–703.01(A), 13–1105(C).  Arizona abolished parole for people with felony convictions in 1994, however, and that remained the law until 2014.  See §41–1604.09(I) (1994); §13–716 (2014); §41–1604.09(I)(2) (1994).  Therefore, for people with first-degree murder convictions, “the only ‘release’ available under Arizona law [wa]s executive clemency, not parole.”  <em>Cruz </em>v. <em>Arizona</em>, <a aria-label=\"598 U. S. 17\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/598/17\">598 U.&nbsp;S. 17</a>, 23 (2023).  Although Arizona’s sentencing statute “continued to list two alternatives to death,” <em>id.</em>, at 21, the “only<em> </em>alternative sentence to death was life imprisonment without parole,” <em>Lynch</em> v. <em>Arizona</em>, <a aria-label=\"578 U. S. 613\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/578/613\">578 U.&nbsp;S. 613</a>, 614 (2016) (<em>per&nbsp;curiam</em>); see also <em>Miller</em>, 567 U.&nbsp;S., at 486 (listing Arizona as one of “29 jurisdictions mandating life without parole for children”).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Bassett was sentenced in 2006.  The trial court sentenced him to one “natural life” sentence on one count and a consecutive “life” sentence on the other count.  Because Bassett was sentenced between 1994 and 2014, the trial judge could sentence him only to life without parole.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">&nbsp;II</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Life-without-parole sentences for juveniles are constitutional only for “those whose crimes reflect permanent incorrigibility” rather than “transient immaturity.”  <em>Montgomery</em> v. <em>Louisiana</em>, <a aria-label=\"577 U. S. 190\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/577/190\">577 U.&nbsp;S. 190</a>, 209 (2016).  Thus, “an individual who commits a homicide when he or she is under 18 may be sentenced to life without parole, but only if the sentence is not mandatory and the sentencer therefore has discretion to impose a lesser punishment.”  <em>Jones</em>, 593 U.&nbsp;S., at 100.  This “discretionary sentencing procedure” is one “where the sentencer can consider the defendant’s youth and has discretion to impose a lesser sentence than life without parole.”  <em>Id</em>., at 112.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Discretionary sentencing schemes “ensure that life-without-parole sentences are imposed only in cases where that sentence is appropriate in light of the defendant’s age.”  <em>Id</em>., at 111–112.  This constitutionally required sentencing scheme reflects the premise that, in deciding whether to impose life-without-parole for a juvenile, consideration of “youth” and “a child’s capacity for change” matter.  <em>Miller</em>, 567 U.&nbsp;S., at 473.  This Court has reaffirmed that “<em>Miller </em>required a discretionary sentencing procedure.”  <em>Jones</em>, 593 U.&nbsp;S., at 110.  Thus, “a State’s discretionary sentencing system” is “constitutionally necessary.”  <em>Id</em>., at 105.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">III</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Arizona’s sentencing scheme left no discretion for a parole-eligible sentence in this case.  No one disputes that.  See Brief in Opposition 1 (“Arizona law did not provide a parole-eligible option at the time of Bassett’s sentencing in 2006”); 256 Ariz., at ___, 535 P.&nbsp;3d, at 8 (“Bassett was actually ineligible for parole”).  That is plainly inconsistent with <em>Miller</em>, <em>Montgomery</em>, and <em>Jones</em>.  The State does “<em>not </em>argu[e] that the mere existence of its two sentencing options saves it from a <em>Miller </em>violation,” and it agrees “parole-eligibility is constitutionally required.”  Brief in Opposition 22, 24.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; Arizona advances three arguments for why Bassett did, in fact, receive all the discretionary process required by <em>Miller</em>.  These arguments formed the basis for the Arizona Supreme Court’s decision below.<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Sotomayor Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_3-1\" id=\"DISSENT_3-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a>  Each runs contrary to <em>Miller</em>’s clear command.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> First, the State contends that the sentencing court “was so mistaken about its own sentencing statutes that it fortuitously complied with <em>Miller</em>” because of a “widespread mistaken belief among Arizona judges and attorneys that the release-eligible option included parole eligibility.”  Brief in Opposition 3, 27.  To start, Arizona eliminated parole more than a decade before Bassett was sentenced, and this argument is “inconsistent with the presumption that state courts know and follow the law.”  <em>Woodford</em> v. <em>Visciotti</em>, <a aria-label=\"537 U. S. 19\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/537/19\">537 U.&nbsp;S. 19</a>, 24 (2002) (<em>per curiam</em>).  Indeed, Arizona courts recognized that state law “eliminat[ed] the possibility of parole for crimes committed after [1993],” <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosario</em>, 195 Ariz. 264, 268, 987 P.&nbsp;2d 226, 230 (App. 1999); and the State itself represented, in this Court and other courts, that state law made life without parole the minimum sentence.  See Brief for State of Michigan et&nbsp;al. as <em>Amici</em> <em>Curiae</em> in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Alabama</em>, O. T. 2011, No. 10–9646, etc., pp. i, 1; see also, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., State Motion To Dismiss in <em>Chaparro </em>v. <em>Ryan</em>, No. 2:19–cv–00650 (D Ariz., Mar. 27, 2019), p. 3 (arguing that “Arizona statutory law at all relevant times unambiguously &nbsp;forbade parole to anyone convicted of first-degree murder after 1993”); Reply Brief 5–6 (collecting examples).  This argument requires speculating, based on no evidence, about the possibility of a judge’s two-decade-old mistaken belief about state law.  <em>Miller</em> permits no such thing.  Instead, as this Court has recently confirmed, “<em>Miller </em>required a discretionary sentencing procedure.”  <em>Jones</em>, 593 U.&nbsp;S., at 110.  Here, it is undisputed that Arizona’s sentencing regime required a sentence of life without parole at the time Bassett was sentenced.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Second, the State contends that Bassett did, in fact, receive “an individualized sentencing hearing at which his youth and attendant characteristics were considered” as mitigation evidence.  Brief in Opposition 14; see also 245 Ariz., at ___–___, 535 P.&nbsp;3d, at 11–13 (noting that “Bassett’s chronological age and attendant characteristics were considered”).  That too misunderstands this Court’s precedents.  Sentencing courts must have the authority to actually “impose a lesser sentence than life without parole,” not just the discretion to consider youth as a mitigating factor.  <em>Jones</em>, 593 U.&nbsp;S., at 112.  In other words, juvenile defendants can be sentenced to life without parole “only so long as the sentence is not mandatory—that is, only so long as the sentencer has discretion to ‘consider the mitigating qualities of youth’ and impose a lesser punishment.”  <em>Id</em>., at 106 (quoting <em>Miller</em>, 567 U.&nbsp;S., at 476).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> When a State offers no possible penalty other than life without parole, the sentence is unconstitutionally mandatory because consideration of age “could not change the sentence; whatever [is] said in mitigation, the mandatory life-without-parole prison term would kick in.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 488.  Here, for example, although the judge mentioned Bassett’s age as a mitigating factor, it is clear that the judge could not have considered how “the distinctive attributes of youth diminish the penological justifications for imposing the &nbsp;harshest sentenc[e]” of life without parole.  <em>Id</em>., at 472.  Because Bassett was sentenced well before <em>Miller</em>, the sentencing court could not have adequately considered Bassett’s youth, his capacity for rehabilitation, or the necessity of a parole-eligible sentence.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> “<em>Miller</em>’s discretionary sentencing procedure has resulted in numerous sentences less than life without parole for defendants who otherwise would have received mandatory life-without parole sentences.”  <em>Jones</em>, 593 U.&nbsp;S., at 119.  That is because, “in concluding that a discretionary sentencing procedure would help make life-without-parole sentences relatively rare, the Court relied on data, not speculation.”  <em>Id</em>., at 112.  Arizona asks this Court to speculate that some consideration of age as a mitigating factor is sufficient to satisfy <em>Miller</em>, <em>Montgomery</em>, and <em>Jones</em>.  Perhaps Bassett would have received the same parole-ineligible sentences for the same reasons the sentencing judge already discussed; or perhaps Bassett’s horrific childhood, including the fact that he was abandoned by his mother, kidnapped and abused by his father, and kept in a closet with just one meal a day, would have led to a parole-eligible sentence.  This Court should not speculate on this cold record, though, because “[d]etermining the proper sentence in such a case raises profound questions of morality and social policy” that are best left to “state sentencing judges and juries.”  <em>Jones</em>, 593 U.&nbsp;S., at 119–120.  Instead, this Court’s role is to ensure that the trial judge had “discretion to impose a lesser punishment in light of [Bassett’s] youth.”  <em>Id</em>., at 120.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Third, the State contends that “the juveniles who received parole-eligible sentences will all receive parole eligibility within 25 years by virtue of the 2014 legislative fix,” so the “functional outcome is no different than if parole-eligibility had been on the books all along.”  Brief in Opposition 21; see also 256 Ariz., at ___–___, 535 P.&nbsp;3d, at 12–13.  That is wrong.  To start, the 2014 reinstatement of parole only applies to juveniles serving “life” sentences, not those &nbsp;serving “natural life” sentences.<a aria-label=\"reference 2 of Sotomayor Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_3-2\" id=\"DISSENT_3-2ref\"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a>  So in this case, for example, it applies to only one of Bassett’s two sentences.  See Brief for 15 Constitutional and Criminal Law Professors  as <em>Amici Curiae</em> on Pet. for Cert. 10 (Law Professors Brief&nbsp;) (“[T]he legislature did nothing to make individuals like Petitioner Bassett, who were sentenced to natural life with no possibility of release, parole-eligible”).<a aria-label=\"reference 3 of Sotomayor Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_3-3\" id=\"DISSENT_3-3ref\"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Moreover, the relevant question is the constitutionality of the sentencing scheme at the time of sentencing; and here the court lacked discretion to impose a sentence less than life without parole when it sentenced Bassett.  Courts generally have “no authority to leave in place a conviction or sentence that violates a substantive rule,” and there is “no grandfather clause that permits States to enforce punishments the Constitution forbids.”  <em>Montgomery</em>, 577 U.&nbsp;S., at 203–204.  Therefore, “any post&nbsp;hoc revision to the sentencing scheme does nothing to alter the lack of discretion that judges faced when Petitioner Bassett and similarly situated defendants were sentenced.  Their sentences remain unconstitutional.”  Law Professors Brief 10.  That is why this Court has already rejected the idea that “the potential for future ‘legislative reform’&nbsp;” can rescue an unconstitutional sentencing scheme.  <em>Lynch</em>, 578 U.&nbsp;S., at 616.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">*  *  *</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> In <em>Jones</em>, this Court<em> </em>assumed that “most offenders who could seek collateral review as a result of <em>Montgomery</em> have done so and, if eligible, have received new discretionary sentences under <em>Miller</em>.”  <em>Jones</em>, 593 U.&nbsp;S., at 111, n.&nbsp;4.  That is simply not true in Arizona.  “Dozens of juvenile offenders in &nbsp;Arizona .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. were sentenced to life imprisonment without the opportunity for any type of release for crimes they committed as teenagers.”  Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> on Pet. for Cert. 3.  <em>Miller </em>identified 28 States that had mandatory life-without-parole sentences for juveniles, including Arizona.  Arizona “remains <em>the only one</em> of those states that has neither made individuals like Petitioner Bassett eligible for parole nor allowed them to be resentenced under a constitutional scheme.”  Law Professors Brief 18–19.<a aria-label=\"reference 4 of Sotomayor Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_3-4\" id=\"DISSENT_3-4ref\"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup></a>  “Arizona thus remains the only state where juvenile homicide defendants are still serving unconstitutional sentences of mandatory life without parole with no meaningful mechanism to challenge their sentences.”  <em>Id</em>., at 21.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Arizona now concedes that “[b]ut for the sentencer’s actual consideration of parole-eligibility and the subsequent statute effectuating this sentence, there would be a <em>Miller </em>violation.”  Brief in Opposition 23.  For the reasons discussed above, those two features do not save Arizona’s scheme.  Because the Arizona Supreme Court’s decision departed from this Court’s established precedents, I would grant the petition for certiorari and summarily reverse the judgment below.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<h3 class=\"fnheader\">Notes</h3>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_3-1\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Sotomayor Dissent at reference 1\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_3-1ref\">1</a> &nbsp;The State does not argue, nor did the Arizona Supreme Court clearly hold, that executive clemency qualifies as the equivalent of a parole-eligible sentence under <em>Miller</em>.  See Brief in Opposition 22–23 (conceding that “clemency-eligibility alone would have been insufficient”).  That is for good reason.  Executive clemency provides no “meaningful” or “realistic opportunity to obtain release.”  <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Florida</em>, <a aria-label=\"560 U. S. 48\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/560/48\">560 U.&nbsp;S. 48</a>, 79, 82 (2010).  Indeed, “<em>amici </em>who track clemency proceedings in Arizona are not aware of a single instance in which an individual convicted of first-degree murder since Arizona eliminated parole in 1994 has received a grant of executive clemency (<em>i.e.</em>, commutation of sentence or pardon).”  Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> on Pet. for Cert. 8.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_3-2\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Sotomayor Dissent at reference 2\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_3-2ref\">2</a> &nbsp;“[A] person who is sentenced to life imprisonment with the possibility of release after serving a minimum number of calendar years for an offense that was committed before the person attained eighteen years of age is eligible for parole on completion of service of the minimum sentence.”  Ariz.

A court has a variety of tools to test the reliability of forensic evidence introduced in criminal trials today.  Yet when a court must look backward, to convictions resting on forensic evidence later repudiated by the scientific community, those tools may fail.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This petition raises difficult questions about the adequacy of current postconviction remedies to correct a conviction secured by what we now know was faulty science.  One in four people exonerated since 1989 were wrongfully convicted based on false or misleading forensic evidence introduced at their trials.<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Sotomayor Statement\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#STATEMENT_3-1\" id=\"STATEMENT_3-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a>  Hundreds if not thousands of innocent people may currently be incarcerated despite a modern consensus that the central piece of evidence at their trials lacked any scientific basis.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Petitioner Charles M. McCrory was convicted of murder in 1985 based on forensic bitemark testimony that has now been roundly condemned by the scientific community and retracted by the expert who introduced it at his trial.  &nbsp;McCrory argues to this Court that this now-discredited forensic evidence rendered his trial fundamentally unfair in violation of the Due Process Clause.  Even if that were true, McCrory faces many procedural hurdles that could delay or even preclude relief based on existing state and federal postconviction statutes.  I vote to deny this petition because due process claims like McCrory’s have yet to percolate sufficiently through the federal courts.  Legislatures concerned with wrongful convictions based on faulty science, however, need not wait for this Court to address a constitutional remedy.  Several States have already tackled this troubling problem through targeted postconviction statutes.  These statutes create an efficient avenue for innocent people convicted based on forensic science that the scientific community has now largely repudiated.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">I</h3>\n<h4 class=\"jy-center\">A</h4>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The wholesale reevaluation of forensic evidence began in 2005, when Congress instructed the National Academy of Sciences to investigate the state of forensic science.  The Academy responded four years later with a groundbreaking 314-page report that strongly suggested many forms of forensic evidence that previously had been accepted by courts were, in fact, scientifically unsound.  See National Research Council, Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward (2009) (NAS Report).  It found that “no forensic method other than nuclear DNA analysis has been rigorously shown to have the capacity to consistently and with a high degree of certainty support conclusions .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ‘matching’ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. an unknown item of evidence to a specific known source.”  <em>Id</em>., at 87.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The NAS Report singled out disciplines based on an expert’s subjective interpretation (as opposed to analysis in a laboratory).  Among those disciplines singled out for critique were bitemark analysis, microscopic hair analysis, &nbsp;fingerprint analysis, shoe print comparisons, toolmark and firearms examination, and handwriting comparisons.<a aria-label=\"reference 2 of Sotomayor Statement\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#STATEMENT_3-2\" id=\"STATEMENT_3-2ref\"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a>  For instance, the NAS Report found “no evidence of an existing scientific basis for identifying an individual to the exclusion of all others” via bitemark evidence, <em>id</em>., at 176, and “no scientific support for the use of hair comparisons” to match a sample to a suspect “in the absence of nuclear DNA,” <em>id</em>., at 161.  It emphasized that courts failed meaningfully to test the reliability of such evidence.  Instead, they “&nbsp;‘routinely affirm[ed] admissibility’&nbsp;” of even “&nbsp;‘the most vulnerable forensic sciences—hair microscopy, bite marks, and handwriting,’&nbsp;” relying on “&nbsp;‘earlier decisions rather than facts established at a hearing.’&nbsp;”  <em>Id</em>., at 107.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Since the NAS Report, the scientific community has shored up some methods of forensic evidence and left others behind.  For instance, a 2016 report to the President from his Council of Advisors on Science and Technology evaluated which of the methods critiqued in the NAS Report had, after further efforts by the scientific community, become “foundationally valid and reliable” enough for use in courts.   Forensic Science in Criminal Courts: Ensuring Scientific Validity of Feature-Comparison Methods 67 (Sept. 2016) (PCAST Report).  For instance, the PCAST Report concluded that “latent fingerprint analysis is a foundationally valid subjective methodology” based on two recent studies, &nbsp;but emphasized that such evidence in court had to be “accompanied by accurate information about limitations on the reliability of the conclusion.”  <em>Id</em>., at 101; see <em>id</em>., at 148–149.  In contrast, it maintained that “bitemark analysis does not meet the scientific standards for foundational validity, and is far from meeting such standards.”  <em>Id</em>., at 87, 148.  The PCAST Report found the “prospects of developing bitemark analysis into a scientifically valid method to be low.”  <em>Id</em>., at 87.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The facts of this petition illustrate some of the problems for courts evaluating this evolving landscape of forensic evidence.  McCrory was convicted of killing his wife in 1985.  The State’s argument centered on the bitemark testimony of celebrity forensic odontologist Dr. Richard Souviron, who gained notoriety after his expert testimony helped secure Ted Bundy’s conviction in 1979.  Dr. Souviron testified that alleged bitemarks on the victim had been made at or about the time of death and were consistent with dental impressions taken from McCrory.  The jury convicted.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In 2002, McCrory filed his first petition for state postconviction review based in part on the unreliability of the bitemark evidence.  He cited a 2001 Newsweek article where Dr. Souviron had stated that “&nbsp;‘You cannot make a positive ID from a bitemark.’&nbsp;”  Brief in Opposition 10.  The state court dismissed McCrory’s petition and he did not appeal.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In 2020, 35 years after his trial, McCrory filed a second petition for state postconviction review.  He argued that “[n]ewly discovered material facts,” namely the scientific consensus rejecting bitemark evidence, entitled him to a new trial under Alabama’s postconviction scheme.  Ala. Rule Crim. Proc.&nbsp;32.1(e) (2024).  Dr. Souviron submitted an affidavit stating that “[u]nder today’s scientific consensus &nbsp;and the changes in the [American Board of Forensic Odontology] Guidelines, it would be unreliable and scientifically unsupported for me or any forensic odontologist to offer individualization testimony that Mr. McCrory was the source of the teeth marks, as I testified in 1985.  I therefore fully recant my testimony that ‘these teeth marks [were] made by Charles McCrory.’&nbsp;”  1 Record 38.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The state postconviction court held an evidentiary hearing.  Two forensic dentists traveled to testify, without compensation, because they both once believed that bitemark evidence could be probative and now understood that it was not.  Both experts testified that, based on today’s scientific understanding, the victim’s injury was “not a human bite mark.”  Tr. 34 (Apr. 28, 2021); <em>id</em>., at 81.  In response, the State introduced the trial transcript.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The court denied McCrory’s petition for two reasons.  First, the court reasoned that because Dr. Souviron complied with the standards in place at the time of the crime, investigation, and trial, the new testimony by forensic dentists could be construed as impeachment testimony.  Second, the court held that there was enough circumstantial evidence of McCrory’s guilt at trial outside of Dr. Souviron’s testimony that the jury still would likely have convicted.  The court included the mold of McCrory’s teeth in this evidence, reasoning that the jury could have made the physical comparison from this mold to the mark on the victim’s arm themselves.<a aria-label=\"reference 3 of Sotomayor Statement\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#STATEMENT_3-3\" id=\"STATEMENT_3-3ref\"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></a>  The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed.<a aria-label=\"reference 4 of Sotomayor Statement\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#STATEMENT_3-4\" id=\"STATEMENT_3-4ref\"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; McCrory has consistently maintained his innocence.  He rejected the State’s offer to plead to time served before the evidentiary hearing on the bitemark testimony.  Now, McCrory asks this Court for relief.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">II</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> In his petition for certiorari, McCrory argues that the expert bitemark testimony at his trial, now fully recanted and repudiated by the scientific community, rendered that trial unconstitutional.  To the Alabama courts, however, McCrory argued primarily that Alabama law entitled him to relief under Alabama Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.1(e), which permits courts to vacate convictions based on “[n]ewly discovered material facts.”  His constitutional claim formed only a small part of his petition under Alabama law’s separate provision that permits relief when the “[c]onstitution of the United States or of the State of Alabama requires a new trial.”  Rule 32.1(a).  Both the trial court and the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals summarily dismissed McCrory’s constitutional claim.  McCrory does not appear yet to have sought habeas review of his conviction in federal court.  Even with a case like McCrory’s, however, where the science underlying the expert evidence at his trial has been fully repudiated by the scientific community and fully recanted by the expert himself, ordinary state and federal avenues for postconviction relief can present significant barriers.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">A</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Many States have postconviction statutes like Alabama’s that allow relief based on “[n]ewly discovered material facts.”  Rule 32.1(e).  Typically, however, these statutes cover evidence that the defendant or his counsel could have but did not know about at the time of trial.  For instance, &nbsp;Alabama’s statute requires that “[t]he facts relied upon were not known by the petitioner or the petitioner’s counsel at the time of trial or sentencing or in time to file a posttrial motion .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or in time to be included in any previous collateral proceeding and could not have been discovered by any of those times through the exercise of reasonable diligence.”  Rule 32.1(e)(1).  Of course, counsel would have no way of knowing that forensic evidence offered at the time of trial would be discredited decades later.  Yet defendants convicted based on forensic evidence that has now been firmly discredited can still struggle to meet the requirements of such statutes in three ways.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> First, because science evolves slowly rather than in conclusive bursts, it can be hard to pinpoint when someone should have “discovered [newly-discrediting evidence] through the exercise of reasonable diligence.”  <em>Ibid.</em>  Unlike a murder weapon left in an abandoned warehouse, forensic science does not lie around waiting for sudden discovery.  State postconviction schemes may also bar claims raised previously, even if the repudiation of the relevant science was in a more nascent stage.  That can harm diligent defendants who may have had previous postconviction petitions denied when the expert testimony underlying their conviction had merely been called into question, but not yet conclusively repudiated by the scientific community.  See A. Maxfield &amp; N. Sanghvi, Junk Statute: How Post-Conviction Statutes Fail Petitioners Convicted Based on False or Misleading Forensic Evidence, 75 Rutgers L.&nbsp;Rev. 1343, 1356–1357 (2023) (detailing these challenges under Pennsylvania’s postconviction review statute).  For instance, McCrory filed a petition in 2002 based on a statement from Dr. Souviron in a 2001 Newsweek article several years before the NAS Report and well before the scientific consensus repudiating bitemark testimony.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Second, States may bar or discount new evidence that merely calls into question the probative value of evidence &nbsp;presented at trial.  In McCrory’s case, both lower courts held that the new evidence “merely amount[ed] to impeachment evidence,” Rule&nbsp;32.1(e)(3); in other words, it would merely have given the jury reason to disbelieve the expert’s evaluation of the evidence.  Evidence that an entire mode of forensic analysis has no scientific basis, however, is of a different category from evidence that might call into question a witness’s credibility or motive to testify.  State postconviction statutes may not account for this difference.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Third, newly-discredited forensic evidence is different from other newly-discovered facts.  Unlike a new witness to a murder or a new analysis of DNA evidence, the new evidence is simply a scientific consensus that the old evidence was unreliable.  In McCrory’s case, for example, it is not that the dental mold was not of McCrory’s teeth or that the victim had no marks on her arm.  It is simply that a modern scientist would be unable to testify that the two had anything to do with each other.  State courts, however, sometimes decline to find that changed science is new evidence that requires a new trial.  See J. Laurin, Criminal Law’s Science Lag: How Criminal Justice Meets Changed Scientific Understanding, 93 Texas L.&nbsp;Rev. 1751, 1763–1764, and nn. 70–72 (2015) (collecting cases where state courts have held that changed science evidence is merely cumulative of other evidence or fails to point affirmatively to innocence).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Even when there is no question that the current scientific consensus would bar the admission of expert testimony in a trial today, state courts may still struggle to apply existing postconviction statutes to provide relief.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Modern trial courts have many tools to ensure the reliability of expert forensic testimony.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Daubert</em> v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"509 U.S. 579\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/509/579\">509 U.&nbsp;S. 579 (1993)</a>; <em>Smith</em> v. <em>Arizona</em>, 602 U.&nbsp;S. ___ (2024).  Many commenta&nbsp;tors, however, have emphasized the challenges in remedying defects in state convictions through federal postconviction review after the passage of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA).  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., L. Kovarsky, Structural Change in State Postconviction Review, 93 Notre Dame L.&nbsp;Rev. 443, 461–465 (2017) (cataloging how AEDPA shifts primary responsibility for error correction from federal to state postconviction proceedings).  AEDPA’s overwhelming concern with the finality of criminal convictions sits uneasily with modern scientific developments that call those convictions into question.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Even beyond these structural barriers to federal postconviction review, prisoners may face substantive challenges with how to fit newly-discredited science into existing constitutional doctrines.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., C. Plummer &amp; I. Syed, Criminal Procedure v. Scientific Progress: The Challenging Path to Post-Conviction Relief in Cases That Arise During Periods of Shifts in Science, 41 Vt. L.&nbsp;Rev. 279, 287 (2016) (describing why someone whose conviction relied on discredited forensic testimony “may well be considered indisputably innocent by today’s standards, but have no apparent legal avenue for relief&nbsp;”).  McCrory’s constitutional argument formed only a small part of his submissions to the Alabama courts and has yet to be passed on by a federal court.  In this Court, he argues that a conviction “based on expert testimony that later is completely eliminated from the case” renders the underlying trial fundamentally unfair under the Due Process Clause.  Pet. for Cert. 26.  This Court has held that “a conviction obtained through use of false evidence, known to be such by representatives of the State, must fall under the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution Amendment xiv\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv\">Fourteenth Amendment</a>.”  <em>Napue</em> v. <em>Illinois</em>, <a aria-label=\"360 U. S. 264\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/360/264\">360 U.&nbsp;S. 264</a>, 269 (1959); see also <em>Escobar </em>v. <em>Texas</em>, 598 U.&nbsp;S. ___ (2023) (vacating and remanding based on Texas’s confession of error about a faulty crime laboratory).  With newly-discredited expert evidence, however, nobody knew that the evidence was faulty at the time of the trial.  &nbsp;Similarly, it is hard to argue that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to science that was discredited only decades after the initial trial.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Of course, none of this prevents federal courts from holding that the lack of any direct evidence of a defendant’s guilt aside from discredited expert testimony rendered a trial fundamentally unfair.  See <em>Spencer</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a aria-label=\"385 U. S. 554\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/385/554\">385 U.&nbsp;S. 554</a>, 563–564 (1967) (“[T]he Due Process Clause guarantees the fundamental elements of fairness in a criminal trial”); <em>Chambers</em> v. <em>Mississippi</em>, <a aria-label=\"410 U. S. 284\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/410/284\">410 U.&nbsp;S. 284</a>, 302 (1973) (holding that “the exclusion of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. critical evidence .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. denied [the defendant] a trial in accord with traditional and fundamental standards of due process”); see also, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Han Tak Lee </em>v. <em>Houtzdale SCI</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/798_F.3d_159\">798 F.&nbsp;3d 159</a>, 169 (CA3 2015) (affirming grant of habeas relief after State failed to point to “&nbsp;‘ample evidence’&nbsp;” sufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt after excluding discredited fire-science evidence); <em>Gimenez </em>v. <em>Ochoa</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/821_F.3d_1136\">821 F.&nbsp;3d 1136</a>, 1145 (CA9 2016) (recognizing “that habeas petitioners can allege a constitutional violation from the introduction of flawed expert testimony at trial if they show that the introduction of this evidence ‘undermined the fundamental fairness of the entire trial’&nbsp;”).  Although AEDPA review can be a backstop on the constitutional rights of criminal defendants, legislatures remain free to address this known flaw with decades-old convictions more directly.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">III</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Rather than waiting for this Court to address discredited forensic evidence testimony via constitutional law, Congress and state legislatures can more efficiently address this known problem in the first instance.  Indeed, at least six States have already taken action.<a aria-label=\"reference 5 of Sotomayor Statement\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#STATEMENT_3-5\" id=\"STATEMENT_3-5ref\"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; Texas led the way in forensic science reform in criminal procedure.  In 2013, Texas passed the first statute that allowed prisoners to challenge wrongful convictions by showing that changes in forensic science seriously undermined the integrity of their criminal trials.  Article 11.073 applies to “relevant scientific evidence that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. contradicts scientific evidence relied on by the state at trial.”  Art. 11.073(a)(2).  If a court finds that such scientific evidence was not available at the time of the trial, would have been admissible, and, if presented at trial, “on the preponderance of the evidence” would have changed the outcome, it can grant relief.  Art. 11.073(b)(2).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In 2018, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals applied the new statute to bitemark evidence from Steven Chaney’s 1987 murder trial.  State experts at Chaney’s trial had testified that a mark on one victim’s arm was a “&nbsp;‘match’&nbsp;” to Chaney.  <em>Ex&nbsp;parte Chaney</em>, 563 S.&nbsp;W. 3d 239, 260.  The court held that the “body of scientific knowledge underlying the field of bitemark comparisons has evolved since [Chaney’s] trial in a way that contradicts the scientific evidence relied on by the State at trial.”  <em>Ibid.</em>  “New peer-reviewed studies discredit[ed] nearly all the testimony” about the mark “being a ‘match,’&nbsp;” and the American Board of Forensic Odontology “has completely disavowed individualization (i.e., that Chaney was a ‘match’), which the State heavily relied upon at Chaney’s trial.”  <em>Id</em>., at 260–261.  The court concluded that the bitemark evidence was the “linchpin of the State’s case”; its “remaining evidence was circumstantial and weak.”  <em>Id</em>., at 262.  Chaney had therefore “shown by a preponderance of the evidence that he would not have been found guilty if the newly available and relevant scientific evidence he now relies upon had been presented at his 1987 trial.”  <em>Id</em>., at 263.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> California has followed a similar trajectory.  In 2014, it &nbsp;revised its postconviction statute’s definition of “false evidence” to “includ[e] opinions of experts that have either been repudiated by the expert who originally provided the opinion at a hearing or trial or that have been undermined by the state of scientific knowledge or later scientific research or technological advances.”  Cal. Penal Code Ann. §1473(e)(1) (West 2023).<a aria-label=\"reference 6 of Sotomayor Statement\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#STATEMENT_3-6\" id=\"STATEMENT_3-6ref\"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup></a>  In 2016, the California Supreme Court applied the revised statute to bitemark testimony from William Richards’ 1997 trial for the murder of his wife.  The court had previously denied Richards’ postconviction challenge based on the expert’s recantation of his bitemark testimony under the then-extant “false evidence” statute.  See <em>In&nbsp;re Richards</em>, 55 Cal. 4th 948, 289 P.&nbsp;3d 860 (2012).  Under the new definition in California’s postconviction statute, however, the court concluded that the bitemark evidence was now “false evidence” that could form the basis of postconviction relief.  <em>In&nbsp;re Richards</em>, 63 Cal. 4th 291, 311, 371 P.&nbsp;3d 195, 209 (2016).  Concluding that, “with the exception of the bite mark evidence, the defense had a substantial response to much of the prosecution’s evidence” and it was therefore “reasonably probable that the false evidence presented by [the expert] at [Richards’] 1997 jury trial affected the outcome of that proceeding,” the court granted Richards relief.  <em>Id</em>., at 315, 371 P.&nbsp;3d, at 211.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> These cases in Texas and California show how targeted legislative reform can allow courts to address convictions based on trial evidence that has been repudiated by the scientific community.  Legislators enabled these courts explicitly to consider changes in forensic science on collateral review of criminal convictions.  “The adoption of these changed science writs empowers courts in state habeas proceedings to reverse wrongful convictions, rather than be hindered by procedure.”  V. Beety, Changed Science Writs &nbsp;and State Habeas Relief, 57 Hous. L.&nbsp;Rev. 483, 531 (2020).  As a result, innocent people can attain freedom sooner.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">*  *  *</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> I vote to deny this petition because the constitutional question McCrory raises has not yet percolated sufficiently in the lower courts to merit this Court’s review.  There is no reason, however, for state legislatures or Congress to wait for this Court before addressing wrongful convictions that rest on repudiated forensic testimony.  </p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<h3 class=\"fnheader\">Notes</h3>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"STATEMENT_3-1\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Sotomayor Statement at reference 1\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#STATEMENT_3-1ref\">1</a> &nbsp;Since 1989, 3,545 people have been exonerated, meaning they were wrongly convicted of a crime.  See Nat’l Registry of Exonerations, https://&nbsp;www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages&nbsp;/&nbsp;ExonerationsContrib&nbsp;FactorsByCrime.aspx.  Of these wrongful convictions, over 1,000 rested in part on forensic evidence now known to have been false or misleading.

For example, there is now significant doubt in the medical community over the validity of “Shaken Baby Syndrome,” or SBS, an expert diagnosis that formed the basis for convicting caregivers of murder when babies died suddenly under their care.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Cavazos </em>v. <em>Smith</em>, <a aria-label=\"565 U.

The abuse was exposed after Doe overdosed on prescription drugs provided by the teacher.  The teacher initially seduced Doe by sending him explicit content on Snapchat, a social-media platform built around the feature of ephemeral, self-&nbsp;deleting messages.  Snapchat is popular among teenagers.  And, because messages sent on the platform are self-&nbsp;deleting, it is popular among sexual predators as well.  Doe sued Snapchat for, among other things, negligent design under Texas law.  He alleged that the platform’s design encourages minors to lie about their age to access the platform, and enables adults to prey upon them through the self-deleting message feature.  See Pet. for Cert. 14–15.  The courts below concluded that §230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 bars Doe’s claims.  <a aria-label=\"47 USC 230\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230\">47 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §230</a>.  The Court of Appeals denied rehearing en banc over the dissent of Judge Elrod, joined by six other judges.  88 F.&nbsp;4th 1069 (2023).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Court declines to grant Doe’s petition for certiorari.  In doing so, the Court chooses not to address whether &nbsp;social-media platforms—some of the largest and most powerful companies in the world—can be held responsible for their own misconduct.  Section 230 of the Communications &nbsp;Decency Act states that “[n]o provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.”  §230(c)(1).  In other words, a social-media platform is not legally responsible as a publisher or speaker for its users’ content.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Notwithstanding the statute’s narrow focus, lower courts have interpreted §230 to “confer sweeping immunity” for a platform’s own actions.  <em>Malwarebytes, Inc.</em> v. <em>Enigma Software Group USA, LLC</em>, 592 U.&nbsp;S. ___, ___ (2020) (statement of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas</span>, J., respecting denial of certiorari) (slip op., at 1).  Courts have “extended §230 to protect companies from a broad array of traditional product-defect claims.”  <em>Id</em>., at ___–___ (slip op., at 8–9) (collecting examples).  Even when platforms have allegedly engaged in egregious, intentional acts—such as “deliberately structur[ing]” a website “to facilitate illegal human trafficking”—platforms have successfully wielded §230 as a shield against suit.  <em>Id.,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 8); see <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Facebook</em>, 595 U.&nbsp;S. ___<em>, </em>___ (2022) (statement of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas</span>, J., respecting denial of certiorari) (slip op., at 2).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The question whether §230 immunizes platforms for their own conduct warrants the Court’s review.  In fact, just last Term, the Court granted certiorari to consider whether and how §230 applied to claims that Google had violated the Antiterrorism Act by recommending ISIS videos to YouTube users.  See <em>Gonzalez</em> v. <em>Google LLC</em>, <a aria-label=\"598 U. S. 617\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/598/617\">598 U.&nbsp;S. 617</a>, 621 (2023).  We were unable to reach §230’s scope, however, because the plaintiffs’ claims would have failed on the merits regardless.  See<em> id.</em>, at 622 (citing <em>Twitter, Inc.</em> v. <em>Taamneh</em>, <a aria-label=\"598 U.S. 471\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/598/471\">598 U.&nbsp;S. 471 (2023)</a>).  This petition presented the Court with an opportunity to do what it could not in <em>Gonzalez</em> and squarely address §230’s scope.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Although the Court denies certiorari today, there will be other opportunities in the future.  But, make no mistake about it—there is danger in delay.  Social-media platforms &nbsp;have increasingly used §230 as a get-out-of-jail free card.  Many platforms claim that users’ content is their own <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> speech.  Because platforms organize users’ content into newsfeeds or other compilations, the argument goes, platforms engage in constitutionally protected speech.  See <em>Moody</em> v. <em>NetChoice</em>, 603 U.&nbsp;S. ___, ___ (2024).  When it comes time for platforms to be held accountable for their websites, however, they argue the opposite.  Platforms claim that since they are <em>not </em>speakers under §230, they cannot be subject to any suit implicating users’ content, even if the suit revolves around the platform’s alleged misconduct.  See <em>Doe</em>, 595 U.&nbsp;S.<em>,</em> at<em> </em>___–___ (statement of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas</span>, J.) (slip op., at 1–2).  In the platforms’ world, they are fully responsible for their websites when it results in constitutional protections, but the moment that responsibility could lead to liability, they can disclaim any obligations and enjoy greater protections from suit than nearly any other industry.  The Court should consider if this state of affairs is what §230 demands.  I respectfully dissent from the denial of certiorari.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tab-pane\" id=\"tab_default_2\">\n<!-- 'notes' content area -->\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

This petition asks us to consider whether that grant of authority is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.  Because the standard this Court currently applies to determine whether Congress has impermissibly delegated legislative power “largely abdicates our duty to enforce that prohibition,” I would grant the petition.  <em>Department of Transportation</em> v. <em>Association of American Railroads</em>, <a aria-label=\"575 U. S. 43\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/575/43\">575 U.&nbsp;S. 43</a>, 77 (2015) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas</span>, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Constitution vests “[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in a Congress of the United States.”  Art. I, §1.  And, “[w]e have held that the Constitution categorically forbids Congress to delegate its legislative power to any other body,” including to an administrative agency.  <em>Association of American Railroads</em>, 575 U.&nbsp;S., at 77 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas</span>, J.); see also <em>Whitman</em> v. <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"531 U. S. 457\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/531/457\">531 U.&nbsp;S. 457</a>, 472 (2001).  But, under our precedents, a delegation of authority is constitutional so long as the relevant statute sets out an “&nbsp;‘intelligible principle’&nbsp;” to guide the agency’s exercise of authority.  <em>Id.</em>, at 472.  The Court of &nbsp;Appeals for the Sixth Circuit upheld the delegation of authority to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration under this “intelligible principle” test, over Judge Nalbandian’s dissent.  79 F.&nbsp;4th 755, 760 (2023).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> I continue to adhere to my view that the intelligible principle test “does not adequately reinforce the Constitution’s allocation of legislative power.”  <em>Association of American Railroads</em>, 575 U.&nbsp;S., at 77 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas</span>, J.); see also <em>Gundy</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"588 U. S. 128\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/588/128\">588 U.&nbsp;S. 128</a>, 164 (2019) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Gorsuch</span>, J., dissenting) (explaining that our current intelligible principle test “has no basis in the original meaning of the Constitution, in history, or even in [our precedents]”).  This case exemplifies the problem.  Congress purported to empower an administrative agency to impose whatever workplace-safety standards it deems “appropriate.”  That power extends to virtually every business in the United States.  See §654(a)(2); §652(5) (defining the regulated “employer[s]” as any “person engaged in a business affecting commerce who has employees”).  The agency claims authority to regulate everything from a power lawnmower’s design, <a aria-label=\"29 CFR\" href=\"/cfr/text/29\">29</a> CFR §1910.243(e) (2023), to the level of “contact between trainers and whales at SeaWorld,” <em>SeaWorld of Florida, LLC</em> v. <em>Perez</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/748_F.3d_1202\">748 F.&nbsp;3d 1202</a>, 1220 (CADC 2014) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Occupational Safety and Health Act may be the broadest delegation of power to an administrative agency found in the United States Code.  See C. Sunstein, Is OSHA Unconstitutional?  94 Va. L.&nbsp;Rev. 1407, 1448 (2008) (“No other federal regulatory statute confers so much discretion on federal administrators, at least in any area with such broad scope”).  If this far-reaching grant of authority does not impermissibly confer legislative power on an agency, it is hard to imagine what would.  It would be no less objectionable if Congress gave the Internal Revenue Service authority to impose any tax on a particular person that it deems “appropriate,” and I doubt any jurist would sustain &nbsp;such a delegation.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The question whether the Occupational Health and Safety Administration’s broad authority is consistent with our constitutional structure is undeniably important.  At least five Justices have already expressed an interest in reconsidering this Court’s approach to Congress’s delegations of legislative power.  See <em>Paul</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 589 U.&nbsp;S. ___, ___ (2019) (statement of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Kavanaugh</span>, J., respecting denial of certiorari) (slip op., at 2); <em>Gundy</em>, 588 U.&nbsp;S., at 149 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Alito</span>, J., concurring in judgment); <em>id</em>., at 164 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Gorsuch</span>, J., joined by <span class=\"smallcaps\">Roberts</span>, C.&nbsp;J., and <span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas</span>, J., dissenting).

See <a aria-label=\"28 USC 2254 d 2\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2254#d_2\">28 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §§2254(d)(2)</a>, (e)(1).  But deference is not a rubber stamp; it “does not imply abandonment or abdication of judicial review.”  <em>Miller-El</em> v. <em>Cockrell</em>, <a aria-label=\"537 U. S. 322\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/537/322\">537 U.&nbsp;S. 322</a>, 340 (2003).  “A federal court can disagree with a state court’s [factual findings] and, when guided by AEDPA, conclude the decision was unreasonable or that the factual premise was incorrect by clear and convincing evidence.”  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In this capital case, a Georgia prosecutor struck every Black woman and all but two Black men from a jury pool during <em>voir&nbsp;dire</em>.  Responding to a challenge from the defendant based on <em>Batson</em> v. <em>Kentucky</em>, <a aria-label=\"476 U.S. 79\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/476/79\">476 U.&nbsp;S. 79 (1986)</a>, the prosecutor protested, arguing that it was “improper” for the court to inquire into his reasons for making the strikes.  4 App. in No.&nbsp;20–12804 (CA11), p.&nbsp;7.  He then proceeded to explain that one of his “main reason[s]” for a specific strike was that “this lady is a black female.”  <em>Id</em>., at 9.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The trial court determined that this racially discriminatory strike violated <em>Batson</em>.  In response, the prosecutor erupted into a rant against <em>Batson</em>.  He repeatedly asserted that it was “improper for this [c]ourt to tell me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that’s not a justifiable strike.”  <em>Id</em>., at 43.  And he concluded: “I take &nbsp;issue with this entire whole process .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  It’s improper and it’s wrong.”  <em>Id</em>., at 44.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> On appeal, the Supreme Court of Georgia found that none of the prosecutor’s other peremptory strikes were racially discriminatory—but nowhere did that court acknowledge the fact that one of the prosecutor’s strikes <em>was</em> explicitly discriminatory, nor did the court even mention the prosector’s drawn-out rants against <em>Batson</em>.  The Eleventh Circuit then proceeded on federal habeas review to conclude that the state court did not make “an unreasonable determination of the facts” under §2254(d)(2), despite its having completely ignored those highly salient facts.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> That was error.  The deference that AEDPA requires is not boundless, and when a state court fails to engage with critical evidence in rendering its factual findings, a federal habeas court should not hesitate to deem those findings unreasonable.  Because I would summarily reverse the Eleventh Circuit’s contrary decision, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">I</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Petitioner Warren King was charged with malice murder and other crimes for his involvement in the killing of a convenience store employee in the course of a robbery.  During jury selection for King’s trial, the prosecutor, Assistant District Attorney John Johnson, used 7 of his 10 allotted peremptory challenges to strike every Black woman and all but two Black men.  As a result of these strikes, Johnson struck 87.5% of the qualified Black jurors but only 8.8% of the qualified White jurors.  Statistically speaking, this meant that Black jurors were about 10 times more likely to be struck than White jurors.  The resulting jury consisted of seven White men, four White women, and one Black man.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The defense challenged Johnson’s strikes as discriminatory in violation of <em>Batson</em>.<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Jackson Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_3-1\" id=\"DISSENT_3-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a>  The trial court determined that &nbsp;a prima facie case of discrimination had been made and directed Johnson to explain his strikes, as <em>Batson</em> requires.  Before complying, however, Johnson made his objection to <em>Batson</em> clear in a lengthy speech that included the following assertions:</p>\n<p class=\"bqonly1para jy-both\">“I object to the [c]ourt’s finding based on the fact that it’s simply on statistical analysis that the State struck eight blacks and three whites, and that has no rational basis to whether a <em>prima facie</em> case of discrimination has been established in this particular case.  I state that for the record.  I know the [c]ourt’s ruling, and I know the issue that has been decided by the Supreme Court of Georgia.  I do state for the record that the Supreme Court of Georgia of course does not know how I strike, and that it is improper for them to involve themselves in this unless defense counsel can point to a specific reason why some particular juror was qualified to serve and that I struck them. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [S]tatistics can never make a <em>prima facie</em> showing.  The Supreme Court of Georgia has said that it does, and I just take exception to that, and I do so for the record.”  4 App. in No.&nbsp;20–12804, at 6–7.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Johnson capped off his objection by asserting his view that a <em>Batson</em>-type analysis “becomes very unwieldy, and that’s why neither this Court nor the Supreme Court nor the defense should be involved in deciding whether or not the State has accurately or effectively performed its strikes.”  <em>Id</em>., at 8.  But then he proceeded to offer reasons &nbsp;for the particular strikes he had made in this case.  The trial court accepted those explanations until Johnson reached prospective juror Jacqueline Alderman, a Black woman.  Johnson explained, “My main reason [for the strike] is that this lady is a black female, she is from Surrency, [and] she knows the defendant and his family.”  <em>Id</em>., at 9.  The trial court, however, noted that Alderman had testified that she did not know King or his family.  The trial court accordingly found that the strike violated <em>Batson</em> and ordered Alderman seated on the jury.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Johnson then made a second oral statement protesting against <em>Batson</em>.  As before, Johnson’s tirade is too long to reproduce fully here, but the following excerpt is emblematic of the position he forcefully maintained:</p>\n<p class=\"bqonly1para jy-both\"> “If this lady were a white lady there would not be a reason—there would not be a question in this case.  And that’s the problem I have with all of this is that it’s not racially neutral.  There was a time when it was racially neutral and that was before <em>Batson</em>.  Because I had to act that way when I was in Brunswick because it was a physical impossibility if you wanted to strike every black off a jury for you to do that.  And we had an issue just—you had to reform your whole ideas and then <em>Batson</em> came out.  And <em>Batson</em> now makes us look whether people are black or not.  Not whether they’re black or white, but black or not.”  <em>Id</em>., at 43–44.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">Johnson concluded by emphasizing that, in his view, “it [was] uncalled for to require people to be reseated on a jury that [he] ha[d] a problem with in this case.”  <em>Id</em>., at 44.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> After his speech concluded, Johnson emphasized that he was “very angry right now,” <em>ibid</em>., but suggested that the trial court place Alderman on the jury while leaving his other strikes untouched.  The trial court and King’s attorneys eventually accepted this compromise, and the court did not revisit its prior conclusions regarding Johnson’s &nbsp;other strikes.  The newly empaneled jury, consisting of 10 White and 2 Black jurors, ultimately convicted King on all charges and sentenced him to death.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> On appeal, the Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed King’s conviction and sentence.  <em>King</em> v. <em>State</em>, 273 Ga. 258, 539 S.&nbsp;E. 2d 783 (2000).  The state court did not, however, even mention Johnson’s repeated, indignant diatribes against <em>Batson</em>.  Nor did it recognize that Johnson’s reason for striking Alderman was explicitly based on race, obliquely referring to that strike only to say that “[t]he trial court found the State’s reason for striking juror Alderman to be insufficient to rebut the prima facie showing of discrimination.”  273 Ga., at 268, 539 S.&nbsp;E. 2d, at 795.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> King filed a petition for habeas corpus in federal court, again pressing his <em>Batson</em> claim.  The District Court denied relief, and a divided panel of the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.  <em>King</em> v. <em>Warden, Ga. Diagnostic Prison</em>, 69 F.&nbsp;4th 856 (2023).  The court acknowledged that King’s case “presents a troubling record and a prosecutor who exercised one racially discriminatory strike and ranted against precedents of the Supreme Court of the United States.”  <em>Id</em>., at 868.  It concluded, however, that the state court’s findings were not unreasonable under AEDPA.  Judge Wilson dissented.  In his view, “even deferentially reviewing the Supreme Court of Georgia’s opinion, no reasonable jurist could have reviewed this record—replete with evidence of racial discrimination—and not found a <em>Batson</em> violation.”  <em>Id</em>., at 881.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">II</h3>\n<h4 class=\"jy-center\">A</h4>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Under AEDPA, a federal court may not grant habeas relief to a state prisoner based on a state court’s factual findings “unless the adjudication of the claim .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State &nbsp;court proceeding.”  §2254(d)(2).  “A determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct”; this “presumption of correctness” must be “rebutt[ed] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. by clear and convincing evidence.”  §2254(e)(1).  Only after a state court’s factual determination is found to be unreasonable can a federal court then assess the merits of a habeas petitioner’s claim “without the deference AEDPA otherwise requires.”  <em>Panetti</em> v. <em>Quarterman</em>, <a aria-label=\"551 U. S. 930\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/551/930\">551 U.&nbsp;S. 930</a>, 953 (2007).  Clearly, this standard incorporates a significant amount of deference to a state court’s prior factual findings.  “A state-court factual determination is not unreasonable merely because the federal court would have reached a different conclusion in the first instance.”  <em>Wood</em> v. <em>Allen</em>, <a aria-label=\"558 U. S. 290\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/558/290\">558 U.&nbsp;S. 290</a>, 301 (2010).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Equally clear, however, is that “[e]ven in the context of federal habeas, deference does not imply abandonment or abdication of judicial review, and does not by definition preclude relief.”  <em>Brumfield</em> v. <em>Cain</em>, <a aria-label=\"576 U. S. 305\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/576/305\">576 U.&nbsp;S. 305</a>, 314 (2015) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Put another way, AEDPA’s “standard is demanding but not insatiable.”  <em>Miller-El</em> v. <em>Dretke</em>, <a aria-label=\"545 U. S. 231\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/545/231\">545 U.&nbsp;S. 231</a>, 240 (2005).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> For that reason, this Court has not hesitated to find AEDPA’s standard satisfied when a state court’s factfinding process disregards information that is highly relevant to a court’s factual determination.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Brumfield</em>, 576 U.&nbsp;S., at 314–316; <em>Wiggins</em> v. <em>Smith</em>, <a aria-label=\"539 U. S. 510\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/539/510\">539 U.&nbsp;S. 510</a>, 528 (2003); <em>Dretke</em>, 545 U.&nbsp;S., at 265–266; see also 2 R. Hertz &amp; J. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure §32.4, p.&nbsp;2002, and n.&nbsp;12 (7th ed. 2023) (collecting lower court cases in which “[t]he state court .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. overlooked or misconstrued evidence”).  To be sure, “a state court need not make detailed findings addressing all the evidence before it.”  <em>Cockrell</em>, 537 U.&nbsp;S., at 347.  But a state court’s disregard for highly salient facts casts serious doubt on the reasonableness of the state court’s determination.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">&nbsp;B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The Georgia Supreme Court’s blinkered assessment of each of prosecutor Johnson’s strikes—divorced from context—ignored highly relevant facts and circumstances in three critical areas, each of which should have informed the Eleventh Circuit’s AEDPA determination.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>First</em>, the Georgia Supreme Court ignored the flagrant nature of the <em>Batson</em> violation the trial court had already recognized—the discriminatory strike of Jacqueline Alderman.  In the state court’s telling, this earlier violation was simply one for which the prosecution’s “reason for striking juror Alderman” was “insufficient to rebut the prima facie showing of discrimination.”  <em>King</em>, 273 Ga., at 268, 539 S.&nbsp;E. 2d, at 795.  But that sugarcoated version of events failed to acknowledge that one of Johnson’s “main reason[s]” for the strike was that Alderman “is a black female,”  4 App. in No.&nbsp;20–12804, at 9, and that Johnson’s nonracial reason for the strike—that Alderman knew King and his family—was in fact false, as the trial court found.  We have emphasized that “historical evidence of the State’s discriminatory peremptory strikes from past trials” are highly probative of a prosecutor’s discriminatory intent.  <em>Flowers</em> v. <em>Mississippi</em>, <a aria-label=\"588 U. S. 284\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/588/284\">588 U.&nbsp;S. 284</a>, 304 (2019); see also <em>Dretke</em>, 545 U.&nbsp;S., at 253–254.  All the more, then, when—as in this case—a discriminatory strike had occurred earlier <em>during the same trial</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Second</em>, the Georgia Supreme Court said absolutely nothing about Johnson’s multiple heated outbursts, all of which made his hostility to <em>Batson</em> patently obvious.  This Court has recognized that “&nbsp;‘the best evidence of discriminatory intent often will be the demeanor of the attorney who exercises the challenge.’&nbsp;”  <em>Flowers</em>, 588 U.&nbsp;S., at 302–303 (quoting <em>Snyder</em> v. <em>Louisiana</em>, <a aria-label=\"552 U. S. 472\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/552/472\">552 U.&nbsp;S. 472</a>, 477 (2008)).  Here, that demeanor provided highly probative evidence that Johnson’s use of peremptory strikes was suspect.  Johnson repeatedly made clear that he disagreed with this Court’s decision in <em>Batson</em> and believed that courts had no business &nbsp;inquiring into the reasons for his strikes.  As the dissent below noted, Johnson’s outbursts “demonstrated, at a minimum, that he was reluctant to abide by the requirements of <em>Batson</em>.”  69 F.&nbsp;4th, at 882 (opinion of Wilson, J.).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Third</em>, racial disparities in a prosecutor’s exercise of peremptory strikes are highly probative of discriminatory intent, and here, “[t]he numbers speak loudly.”  <em>Flowers</em>, 588 U.&nbsp;S., at 305.  Again, Johnson struck 87.5% of the qualified Black jurors while striking only 8.8% of the qualified White jurors.  In a prior case, we have described this kind of disparity—there, the striking of 10 out of 11 Black jurors—as “remarkable.”  <em>Dretke</em>, 545 U.&nbsp;S., at 240–241.  With such stark numbers, “[h]appenstance is unlikely.”  <em>Cockrell</em>, 537 U.&nbsp;S., at 342.  This fact, too, does not appear anywhere in the Georgia Supreme Court’s opinion.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Eleventh Circuit should have been attentive to the fact that the Georgia Supreme Court’s <em>Batson</em> determination exhibited such critical flaws born out of its abject failure to grapple with what actually happened at trial.  The state court’s watered-down description of Johnson’s initial <em>Batson</em> violation should have raised alarm bells as the Circuit evaluated the reasonableness of the state court’s factual findings under AEDPA.  The Court of Appeals also should have had grave doubts about the reasonableness of the state court’s factual findings due to its failure to acknowledge the prosecutor’s pertinent and disturbing anti-<em>Batson</em> rants.  And the stark statistical evidence of the prosecutor’s discriminatory strike behavior—again, unmentioned by the State Supreme Court—should have served as further confirmation that AEDPA deference to that court’s factual findings was not warranted.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In short, the Eleventh Circuit failed to faithfully apply AEDPA’s review standard here.  Given that the Georgia Supreme Court did not address, or even mention, the prosecutor’s expressed antipathy toward <em>Batson</em>, the Eleventh Circuit should have deemed AEDPA’s unreasonable-&nbsp;determination standard satisfied and proceeded to review the merits of King’s claim without the deference that AEDPA usually requires.  See <em>Panetti</em>, 551 U.&nbsp;S., at 953.  Such a nondeferential review of the strikes at issue here might well have made a difference—as Judge Wilson noted in dissent, there is good reason to believe that King’s <em>Batson</em> claim would otherwise have prevailed.<a aria-label=\"reference 2 of Jackson Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_3-2\" id=\"DISSENT_3-2ref\"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a>  But the Court of Appeals reflexively deferred to the Georgia Supreme Court, notwithstanding glaring flaws in the state court’s factual findings.  Even under AEDPA’s deferential standard, federal courts play an important role in “&nbsp;‘guard[ing] against extreme malfunctions in the state criminal justice systems.’&nbsp;”  <em>Harrington</em> v. <em>Richter</em>, <a aria-label=\"562 U. S. 86\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/562/86\">562 U.&nbsp;S. 86</a>, 102 (2011).  The Eleventh Circuit’s failure to do so here is deeply unfortunate, and it reflects a neglectful response to the apparent trend of disturbingly lax <em>Batson</em> enforcement on the part of Georgia’s high court.<a aria-label=\"reference 3 of Jackson Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_3-3\" id=\"DISSENT_3-3ref\"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">*  *  *</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> <em>Batson</em>’s third step requires courts to consider a prosecu&nbsp;tor’s “strike in the context of all the facts and circumstances.”  <em>Flowers</em>, 588 U.&nbsp;S., at 315.  Here, the Georgia Supreme Court ignored highly salient facts about the prosecutor’s admittedly discriminatory strike behavior and antipathy toward the legal standards that address such conduct.  Instead, the state court made a narrow assessment of the prosecutor’s strikes that lacked important context.  Therefore, the state court’s denial of King’s <em>Batson</em> claim was “based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.”  §2254(d)(2).  Accordingly, I would summarily reverse the Court of Appeals’ erroneous application of deference in upholding the state court’s decision and remand for reconsideration of King’s <em>Batson</em> claim “without the deference AEDPA otherwise requires.”  <em>Panetti</em>, 551 U.&nbsp;S., at 953.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<h3 class=\"fnheader\">Notes</h3>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_3-1\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Jackson Dissent at reference 1\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_3-1ref\">1</a> &nbsp;Under this Court’s decision in <em>Batson</em> v. <em>Kentucky</em>, <a aria-label=\"476 U.

The witness later recanted her coerced confession, including in jailhouse letters she sent to her husband.  Upon learning about the letters, a court ordered the witness to retrieve and turn them over to Miller’s defense team.  The lead prosecutor on Miller’s case, Keith Craycraft, instead allegedly encouraged the witness to destroy the letters in response to the court order.  The witness destroyed the letters instead of turning them over.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Miller spent two years in prison before the State dropped the charges against him.  Miller then sued Craycraft and others under Rev. Stat. §1979, <a aria-label=\"42 USC 1983\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983\">42 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §1983</a>, for malicious prosecution, fabrication and destruction of evidence, due process violations, and conspiracy.  The District Court dismissed the claims against Craycraft, concluding that he had absolute immunity as a prosecutor.  The Sixth Circuit agreed, but noted that Craycraft’s “successful pressuring of [the witness] to destroy her jailhouse correspondence” was “difficult to justify and seemingly unbecoming of an official entrusted with enforcing the criminal law.”  72 F. 4th 711, 720 (2023).  Miller now asks this Court to decide whether absolute immunity is available under §1983 when, as here, a prosecutor knowingly destroys exculpatory evidence and &nbsp;defies a court order.  Pet. for Cert. i.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Court’s denial of certiorari should not signal tolerance of the prosecutor’s conduct.<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Sotomayor Statement\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#STATEMENT_3-1\" id=\"STATEMENT_3-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a>  The allegations, assumed true at this stage of the case, tell a disturbing story.  Prosecutors are “representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done.”  <em>Berger</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"295 U. S. 78\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/295/78\">295 U.&nbsp;S. 78</a>, 88 (1935).  The prosecutor’s conduct in this case “diminishes the dignity of our criminal justice system and undermines respect for the rule of law.”  <em>Calhoun </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"568 U. S. 1206\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/568/1206\">568 U.&nbsp;S. 1206</a>, 1208 (2013) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Sotomayor, J.</span>, statement respecting denial of certiorari).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Prosecutorial immunity can promote “the vigorous and fearless performance of the prosecutor’s duty.”  <em>Imbler</em> v. <em>Pachtman</em>, <a aria-label=\"424 U. S. 409\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/424/409\">424 U.&nbsp;S. 409</a>, 427 (1976).  This immunity has limits, however.  For example, absolute immunity does not apply “when a prosecutor gives advice to police during a criminal investigation, when the prosecutor makes statements to the press, or when a prosecutor acts as a complaining witness in support of a warrant application.”  <em>Van de Kamp</em> v. <em>Goldstein</em>, <a aria-label=\"555 U. S. 335\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/555/335\">555 U.&nbsp;S. 335</a>, 343 (2009) (citations omitted).<a aria-label=\"reference 2 of Sotomayor Statement\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#STATEMENT_3-2\" id=\"STATEMENT_3-2ref\"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a>  It is difficult to see how the conduct alleged here, &nbsp;including destruction of evidence to thwart a court order, “require[s] legal knowledge and the exercise of related discretion,” <em>id</em>., at 344, or is “intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process,” <em>Imbler</em>, 424 U.&nbsp;S., at 430.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Even when absolute prosecutorial immunity applies, it “does not leave the public powerless to deter misconduct or to punish that which occurs.”  <em>Id</em>., at 429.  Prosecutors accused of misconduct may still face criminal liability or “professional discipline.”  <em>Ibid</em>.; see also <em>Connick</em> v. <em>Thompson</em>, <a aria-label=\"563 U. S. 51\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/563/51\">563 U.&nbsp;S. 51</a>, 66 (2011) (“An attorney who violates his or her ethical obligations is subject to professional discipline, including sanctions, suspension, and disbarment”).

If this is what absolute prosecutorial immunity protects, the Court may need to step in to ensure that the doctrine does not exceed its “&nbsp;‘quite sparing’&nbsp;” bounds.  <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Fitzsimmons</em>, <a aria-label=\"509 U.

Further, as Judge Nalbandian discussed in his opinion below, recent scholarship details that the 1871 Civil Rights Act included language abrogating common-law immunities that was, for unknown reasons, omitted from the first compilation of federal law.  72 F. 4th 711, 727, n.&nbsp;1 (CA6 2023) (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (“So, according to this recent scholarship, because the Civil Rights Act of 1871 explicitly abrogated the common-law immunities grounded in state law, those immunities are abrogated now <em>sub silentio </em>under the current version of §1983” (citing <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Jarrett</em>, 63 F. 4th 971, 980 (CA5 2023) (Willet, J., concurring)); Civil Rights Act of 1871, <a href=\"/rio/citation/17_Stat._13\">17 Stat. 13</a>;<em> </em>A.

Trump on four counts for conduct that occurred during his Presidency following the November 2020 election.  The indictment alleged that after losing that election, Trump conspired to overturn it by spreading knowingly false claims of election fraud to obstruct the collecting, counting, and certifying of the election results.  Trump moved to dismiss the indictment based on Presidential immunity, arguing that a President has absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions performed within the outer perimeter of his official responsibilities, and that the indictment’s allegations fell within the core of his official duties.  The District Court denied Trump’s motion to dismiss, holding that former Presidents do not possess federal criminal immunity for any acts.  The D.&nbsp;C. Circuit affirmed.  Both the District Court and the D.&nbsp;C. Circuit declined to decide whether the indicted conduct involved official acts.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-e jy-both\"><em>Held</em>: Under our constitutional structure of separated powers, the nature of Presidential power entitles a former President to absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority.  And he is entitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts.  There is no immunity for unofficial acts.  Pp. 5–43.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> (a)&nbsp;This case is the first criminal prosecution in our Nation’s history of a former President for actions taken during his Presidency.  Determining whether and under what circumstances such a prosecution may proceed requires careful assessment of the scope of Presidential power under the Constitution.  The nature of that power requires that a former President have some immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts during his tenure in office.  At least with respect to the &nbsp;President’s exercise of his core constitutional powers, this immunity must be absolute.  As for his remaining official actions, he is entitled to at least presumptive immunity.  Pp. 5–15.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\">  (1)&nbsp;Article II of the Constitution vests “executive Power” in “a President of the United States of America.”  §1, cl. 1.  The President has duties of “unrivaled gravity and breadth.”  <em>Trump </em>v. <em>Vance</em>, <a aria-label=\"591 U. S. 786\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/591/786\">591 U.&nbsp;S. 786</a>, 800.<em> </em>His authority to act necessarily “stem[s] either from an act of Congress or from the Constitution itself.”  <em>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co.</em> v. <em>Sawyer</em>, <a aria-label=\"343 U. S. 579\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/343/579\">343 U.&nbsp;S. 579</a>, 585.  In the latter case, the President’s authority is sometimes “conclusive and preclusive.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 638 (Jackson, J., concurring).  When the President exercises such authority, Congress cannot act on, and courts cannot examine, the President’s actions.  It follows that an Act of Congress—either a specific one targeted at the President or a generally applicable one—may not criminalize the President’s actions within his exclusive constitutional power.  Neither may the courts adjudicate a criminal prosecution that examines such Presidential actions.  The Court thus concludes that the President is absolutely immune from criminal prosecution for conduct within his exclusive sphere of constitutional authority.  Pp. 6–9.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\">  (2)&nbsp;Not all of the President’s official acts fall within his “conclusive and preclusive” authority.  The reasons that justify the President’s absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for acts within the scope of his exclusive constitutional authority do not extend to conduct in areas where his authority is shared with Congress.  To determine the President’s immunity in this context, the Court looks primarily to the Framers’ design of the Presidency within the separation of powers, precedent on Presidential immunity in the civil context, and criminal cases where a President resisted prosecutorial demands for documents.  P. 9.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\">   (i)&nbsp;The Framers designed the Presidency to provide for a “vigorous” and “energetic” Executive.  The Federalist No. 70, pp. 471–472 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton).  They vested the President with “supervisory and policy responsibilities of utmost discretion and sensitivity.”  <em>Nixon</em> v. <em>Fitzgerald</em>, <a aria-label=\"457 U. S. 731\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/457/731\">457 U.&nbsp;S. 731</a>, 750.  Appreciating the “unique risks” that arise when the President’s energies are diverted by proceedings that might render him “unduly cautious in the discharge of his official duties,” the Court has recognized Presidential immunities and privileges “rooted in the constitutional tradition of the separation of powers and supported by our history.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 749, 751, 752, n. 32.  In <em>Fitzgerald</em>, for instance, the Court concluded that a former President is entitled to absolute immunity from “damages liability for acts within the ‘outer perimeter’ of his official responsibility.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 756.  The Court’s “dominant concern” was to avoid “diversion of the President’s attention during the decisionmaking process caused by needless &nbsp;worry as to the possibility of damages actions stemming from any particular official decision.”  <em>Clinton </em>v. <em>Jones</em>, <a aria-label=\"520 U. S. 681\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/520/681\">520 U. S. 681</a>, 694, n.&nbsp;19.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> By contrast, when prosecutors have sought evidence from the President, the Court has consistently rejected Presidential claims of absolute immunity.  During the treason trial of former Vice President Aaron Burr, for instance, Chief Justice Marshall rejected President Thomas Jefferson’s claim that the President could not be subjected to a subpoena.  Marshall simultaneously recognized, however, the existence of a “privilege” to withhold certain “official paper[s].”  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Burr</em>, 25 F.&nbsp;Cas. 187, 192 (No. 14,694) (CC Va.).  And when a subpoena issued to President Richard Nixon, the Court rejected his claim of “absolute privilege.”  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Nixon</em>, <a aria-label=\"418 U. S. 683\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/418/683\">418 U.&nbsp;S. 683</a>, 703.  But recognizing “the public interest in candid, objective, and even blunt or harsh opinions in Presidential decisionmaking,” it held that a “presumptive privilege” protects Presidential communications.  <em>Id</em>., at 708.  Because that privilege “relates to the effective discharge of a President’s powers,” <em>id.</em>, at 711, the Court deemed it “fundamental to the operation of Government and inextricably rooted in the separation of powers under the Constitution.”  <em>Id</em>., at 708.  Pp. 9–12.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\">   (ii)&nbsp;Criminally prosecuting a President for official conduct undoubtedly poses a far greater threat of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch than simply seeking evidence in his possession.  The danger is greater than what led the Court to recognize absolute Presidential immunity from civil damages liability—that the President would be chilled from taking the “bold and unhesitating action” required of an independent Executive.  <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 745.  Although the President might be exposed to fewer criminal prosecutions than civil damages suits, the threat of trial, judgment, and imprisonment is a far greater deterrent and plainly more likely to distort Presidential decisionmaking than the potential payment of civil damages.  The hesitation to execute the duties of his office fearlessly and fairly that might result when a President is making decisions under “a pall of potential prosecution,” <em>McDonnell</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"579 U. S. 550\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/579/550\">579 U.&nbsp;S. 550</a>, 575, raises “unique risks to the effective functioning of government,” <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 751.  But there is also a compelling “public interest in fair and effective law enforcement.”  <em>Vance</em>, 591 U.&nbsp;S., at 808.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> Taking into account these competing considerations, the Court concludes that the separation of powers principles explicated in the Court’s precedent necessitate at least a <em>presumptive</em> immunity from criminal prosecution for a President’s acts within the outer perimeter of his official responsibility.  Such an immunity is required to safeguard the independence and effective functioning of the Executive &nbsp;Branch, and to enable the President to carry out his constitutional duties without undue caution.  At a minimum, the President must be immune from prosecution for an official act unless the Government can show that applying a criminal prohibition to that act would pose no “dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.”  <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 754.  Pp. 12–15.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\">  (3)&nbsp;As for a President’s unofficial acts, there is no immunity.  Although Presidential immunity is required for <em>official</em> actions to ensure that the President’s decisionmaking is not distorted by the threat of future litigation stemming from those actions, that concern does not support immunity for <em>unofficial</em> conduct.  <em>Clinton</em>, 520 U.&nbsp;S., at 694, and n.&nbsp;19.  The separation of powers does not bar a prosecution predicated on the President’s unofficial acts.  P. 15.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> (b)&nbsp;The first step in deciding whether a former President is entitled to immunity from a particular prosecution is to distinguish his official from unofficial actions.  In this case, no court thus far has drawn that distinction, in general or with respect to the conduct alleged in particular.  It is therefore incumbent upon the Court to be mindful that it is “a court of final review and not first view.”  <em>Zivotofsky</em> v. <em>Clinton</em>, <a aria-label=\"566 U. S. 189\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/566/189\">566 U.&nbsp;S. 189</a>, 201.  Critical threshold issues in this case are how to differentiate between a President’s official and unofficial actions, and how to do so with respect to the indictment’s extensive and detailed allegations covering a broad range of conduct.  The Court offers guidance on those issues.  Pp.&nbsp;16–32.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\">  (1)&nbsp;When the President acts pursuant to “constitutional and statutory authority,” he takes official action to perform the functions of his office.  <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 456 U.&nbsp;S., at 757.<em> </em> Determining whether an action is covered by immunity thus begins with assessing the President’s authority to take that action.  But the breadth of the President’s “discretionary responsibilities” under the Constitution and laws of the United States frequently makes it “difficult to determine which of [his] innumerable ‘functions’ encompassed a particular action.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 756.  The immunity the Court has recognized therefore extends to the “outer perimeter” of the President’s official responsibilities, covering actions so long as they are “not manifestly or palpably beyond [his] authority.”  <em>Blassingame</em> v. <em>Trump</em>, 87 F. 4th 1, 13 (CADC).</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> In dividing official from unofficial conduct, courts may not inquire into the President’s motives.  Such a “highly intrusive” inquiry would risk exposing even the most obvious instances of official conduct to judicial examination on the mere allegation of improper purpose.  <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 756.  Nor may courts deem an action unofficial merely because it allegedly violates a generally applicable law.  Otherwise, Presidents would be subject to trial on “every allegation that an action was unlawful,” depriving immunity of its intended effect.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Pp. 17–19.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\">  (2)&nbsp;With the above principles in mind, the Court turns to the conduct alleged in the indictment.  Certain allegations—such as those involving Trump’s discussions with the Acting Attorney General—are readily categorized in light of the nature of the President’s official relationship to the office held by that individual.  Other allegations—such as those involving Trump’s interactions with the Vice President, state officials, and certain private parties, and his comments to the general public—present more difficult questions.  Pp. 19–30.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\">   (i)&nbsp;The indictment alleges that as part of their conspiracy to overturn the legitimate results of the 2020 presidential election, Trump and his co-conspirators attempted to leverage the Justice Department’s power and authority to convince certain States to replace their legitimate electors with Trump’s fraudulent slates of electors.  According to the indictment, Trump met with the Acting Attorney General and other senior Justice Department and White House officials to discuss investigating purported election fraud and sending a letter from the Department to those States regarding such fraud.  The indictment further alleges that after the Acting Attorney General resisted Trump’s requests, Trump repeatedly threatened to replace him.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> The Government does not dispute that the indictment’s allegations regarding the Justice Department involve Trump’s use of official power.  The allegations in fact plainly implicate Trump’s “conclusive and preclusive” authority.  The Executive Branch has “exclusive authority and absolute discretion” to decide which crimes to investigate and prosecute, including with respect to allegations of election crime.  <em>Nixon</em>, 418 U.&nbsp;S., at 693.  And the President’s “management of the Executive Branch” requires him to have “unrestricted power to remove the most important of his subordinates”—such as the Attorney General—“in their most important duties.”  <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 750.  The indictment’s allegations that the requested investigations were shams or proposed for an improper purpose do not divest the President of exclusive authority over the investigative and prosecutorial functions of the Justice Department and its officials.  Because the President cannot be prosecuted for conduct within his exclusive constitutional authority, Trump is absolutely immune from prosecution for the alleged conduct involving his discussions with Justice Department officials.  Pp. 19–21.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\">   (ii)&nbsp;The indictment next alleges that Trump and his co-conspirators “attempted to enlist the Vice President to use his ceremonial role at the January 6 certification proceeding to fraudulently alter the election results.”  App. 187, Indictment ¶10(d).  In particular, the indictment alleges several conversations in which Trump pressured the Vice President to reject States’ legitimate electoral votes or send them back &nbsp;to state legislatures for review.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> Whenever the President and Vice President discuss their official responsibilities, they engage in official conduct.  Presiding over the January 6 certification proceeding at which Members of Congress count the electoral votes is a constitutional and statutory duty of the Vice President.  Art.&nbsp;II, §1, cl.&nbsp;3; Amdt. 12; <a aria-label=\"3 USC 15\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/15\">3 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §15</a>.  The indictment’s allegations that Trump attempted to pressure the Vice President to take particular acts in connection with his role at the certification proceeding thus involve official conduct, and Trump is at least presumptively immune from prosecution for such conduct.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> The question then becomes whether that presumption of immunity is rebutted under the circumstances.  It is the Government’s burden to rebut the presumption of immunity.  The Court therefore remands to the District Court to assess in the first instance whether a prosecution involving Trump’s alleged attempts to influence the Vice President’s oversight of the certification proceeding would pose any dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.  Pp. 21–24.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\">   (iii)&nbsp;The indictment’s remaining allegations involve Trump’s interactions with persons outside the Executive Branch: state officials, private parties, and the general public.  In particular, the indictment alleges that Trump and his co-conspirators attempted to convince certain state officials that election fraud had tainted the popular vote count in their States, and thus electoral votes for Trump’s opponent needed to be changed to electoral votes for Trump.  After Trump failed to convince those officials to alter their state processes, he and his co-conspirators allegedly developed and effectuated a plan to submit fraudulent slates of Presidential electors to obstruct the certification proceeding.  On Trump’s view, the alleged conduct qualifies as official because it was undertaken to ensure the integrity and proper administration of the federal election.  As the Government sees it, however, Trump can point to no plausible source of authority enabling the President to take such actions.  Determining whose characterization may be correct, and with respect to which conduct, requires a fact-specific analysis of the indictment’s extensive and interrelated allegations.  The Court accordingly remands to the District Court to determine in the first instance whether Trump’s conduct in this area qualifies as official or unofficial.  Pp. 24–28.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\">   (iv)&nbsp;The indictment also contains various allegations regarding Trump’s conduct in connection with the events of January 6 itself.  The alleged conduct largely consists of Trump’s communications in the form of Tweets and a public address.  The President possesses “extraordinary power to speak to his fellow citizens and on their behalf.”  <em>Trump</em> v. <em>Hawaii</em>, <a aria-label=\"585 U. S. 667\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/585/667\">585 U.&nbsp;S. 667</a>, 701.  So most of a President’s public &nbsp;communications are likely to fall comfortably within the outer perimeter of his official responsibilities.  There may, however, be contexts in which the President speaks in an unofficial capacity—perhaps as a candidate for office or party leader.  To the extent that may be the case, objective analysis of “content, form, and context” will necessarily inform the inquiry.  <em>Snyder</em> v. <em>Phelps</em>, <a aria-label=\"562 U. S. 443\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/562/443\">562 U.&nbsp;S. 443</a>, 453.  Whether the communications alleged in the indictment involve official conduct may depend on the content and context of each.  This necessarily factbound analysis is best performed initially by the District Court.  The Court therefore remands to the District Court to determine in the first instance whether this alleged conduct is official or unofficial.  Pp. 28–30.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\">  (3)&nbsp;Presidents cannot be indicted based on conduct for which they are immune from prosecution.  On remand, the District Court must carefully analyze the indictment’s remaining allegations to determine whether they too involve conduct for which a President must be immune from prosecution.  And the parties and the District Court must ensure that sufficient allegations support the indictment’s charges without such conduct.  Testimony or private records of the President or his advisers probing such conduct may not be admitted as evidence at trial.  Pp. 30–32.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> (c)&nbsp;Trump asserts a far broader immunity than the limited one the Court recognizes, contending that the indictment must be dismissed because the Impeachment Judgment Clause requires that impeachment and Senate conviction precede a President’s criminal prosecution.  But the text of the Clause does not address whether and on what conduct a President may be prosecuted if he was never impeached and convicted.  See Art.&nbsp;I, §3, cl. 7.  Historical evidence likewise lends little support to Trump’s position.  The Federalist Papers on which Trump relies concerned the checks available against a <em>sitting</em> President; they did not endorse or even consider whether the Impeachment Judgment Clause immunizes a <em>former</em> President from prosecution.  Transforming the political process of impeachment into a necessary step in the enforcement of criminal law finds little support in the text of the Constitution or the structure of the Nation’s Government.  Pp. 32–34.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> (d)&nbsp;The Government takes a similarly broad view, contending that the President enjoys no immunity from criminal prosecution for any action.  On its view, as-applied challenges in the course of the trial suffice to protect Article II interests, and review of a district court’s decisions on such challenges should be deferred until after trial.  But questions about whether the President may be held liable for particular actions, consistent with the separation of powers, must be addressed at the outset of a proceeding.  Even if the President were ultimately not found liable for certain official actions, the possibility of an extended proceeding alone may render him “unduly cautious in the &nbsp;discharge of his official duties.”  <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 752, n. 32.  The Constitution does not tolerate such impediments to “the effective functioning of government.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 751.  Pp. 34–37.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> (e)&nbsp;This case poses a question of lasting significance: When may a former President be prosecuted for official acts taken during his Presidency?  In answering that question, unlike the political branches and the public at large, the Court cannot afford to fixate exclusively, or even primarily, on present exigencies.  Enduring separation of powers principles guide our decision in this case.  The President enjoys no immunity for his unofficial acts, and not everything the President does is official.  The President is not above the law.  But under our system of separated powers, the President may not be prosecuted for exercising his core constitutional powers, and he is entitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for his official acts.  That immunity applies equally to all occupants of the Oval Office.

We consider the scope of a President’s immunity from criminal prosecution.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">I</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> From January 2017 until January 2021, Donald J. Trump served as President of the United States.  On August 1, 2023, a federal grand jury indicted him on four counts for conduct that occurred during his Presidency following the November 2020 election.  The indictment alleged that after losing that election, Trump conspired to overturn it by spreading knowingly false claims of election fraud to obstruct the collecting, counting, and certifying of the election results.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> According to the indictment, Trump advanced his goal through five primary means.  First, he and his co-conspirators “used knowingly false claims of election fraud to get state legislators and election officials to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. change electoral &nbsp;votes for [Trump’s] opponent, Joseph R. Biden, Jr., to electoral votes for [Trump].”  App. 185, Indictment ¶10(a).  Second, Trump and his co-conspirators “organized fraudulent slates of electors in seven targeted states” and “caused these fraudulent electors to transmit their false certificates to the Vice President and other government officials to be counted at the certification proceeding on January 6.”  <em>Id</em>., at 186, ¶10(b).  Third, Trump and his co-conspirators attempted to use the Justice Department “to conduct sham election crime investigations and to send a letter to the targeted states that falsely claimed that the Justice Department had identified significant concerns that may have impacted the election outcome.”  <em>Id</em>., at 186–187, ¶10(c).  Fourth, Trump and his co-conspirators attempted to persuade “the Vice President to use his ceremonial role at the January 6 certification proceeding to fraudulently alter the election results.”  <em>Id</em>., at 187, ¶10(d).  And when that failed, on the morning of January 6, they “repeated knowingly false claims of election fraud to gathered supporters, falsely told them that the Vice President had the authority to and might alter the election results, and directed them to the Capitol to obstruct the certification proceeding.”  <em>Ibid.</em>  Fifth, when “a large and angry crowd .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. violently attacked the Capitol and halted the proceeding,” Trump and his co-conspirators “exploited the disruption by redoubling efforts to levy false claims of election fraud and convince Members of Congress to further delay the certification.”  <em>Id</em>., at 187–188, ¶10(e).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Based on this alleged conduct, the indictment charged Trump with (1) conspiracy to defraud the United States in violation of <a aria-label=\"18 USC 371\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/371\">18 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §371</a>, (2) conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding in violation of §1512(k), (3) obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding in violation &nbsp;of §1512(c)(2), §2, and (4) conspiracy against rights in violation of §241.<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Roberts Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-1\" id=\"OPINION_4-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Trump moved to dismiss the indictment based on Presidential immunity.  In his view, the conduct alleged in the indictment, properly characterized, was that while he was President he (1) “made public statements about the administration of the federal election”; (2) communicated with senior Justice Department officials “about investigating election fraud and about choosing the leadership” of the Department; (3) “communicated with state officials about the administration of the federal election and their exercise of official duties with respect to it”; (4) “communicated with the Vice President” and with “Members of Congress about the exercise of their official duties regarding the election certification”; and (5) “authorized or directed others to organize contingent slates of electors in furtherance of his attempts to convince the Vice President to exercise his official authority in a manner advocated for by President Trump.”  Motion To Dismiss Indictment Based on Presidential Immunity in No. 1:23–cr–00257 (DC), ECF Doc. 74, p.&nbsp;9.  Trump argued that all of the indictment’s allegations fell within the core of his official duties.  <em>Id.</em>, at 27.  And he contended that a President has absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions performed within the outer perimeter of his official responsibilities, to ensure that he can undertake the especially sensitive duties of his office with bold and unhesitating action.  <em>Id.</em>, at 14, 24.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The District Court denied the motion to dismiss, holding &nbsp;that “former Presidents do not possess absolute federal criminal immunity for any acts committed while in office.”  2023 WL 8359833, *15 (DC, Dec. 1, 2023).  The District Court recognized that the President is immune from damages liability in civil cases, to protect against the chilling effect such exposure might have on the carrying out of his responsibilities.  See <em>Nixon</em> v. <em>Fitzgerald</em>, <a aria-label=\"457 U. S. 731\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/457/731\">457 U.&nbsp;S. 731</a>, 749–756 (1982).  But it reasoned that “the possibility of vexatious post-Presidency litigation is much reduced in the criminal context” in light of “[t]he robust procedural safeguards attendant to federal criminal prosecutions.”  2023 WL 8359833, *9–*10.  The District Court declined to decide whether the indicted conduct involved official acts.  See <em>id.</em>, at *15.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The D.&nbsp;C. Circuit affirmed.  91 F.&nbsp;4th 1173 (2024) (<em>per&nbsp;curiam</em>).  Citing <em>Marbury</em> v. <em>Madison</em>, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), the court distinguished between two kinds of official acts: discretionary and ministerial.  91 F.&nbsp;4th, at 1189–1190.  It observed that “although discretionary acts are ‘only politically examinable,’ the judiciary has the power to hear cases” involving ministerial acts that an officer is directed to perform by the legislature.  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Marbury</em>, 1 Cranch, at 166).  From this distinction, the D.&nbsp;C. Circuit concluded that the “separation of powers doctrine, as expounded in <em>Marbury</em> and its progeny, necessarily permits the Judiciary to oversee the federal criminal prosecution of a former President for his official acts because the fact of the prosecution means that the former President has allegedly acted in defiance of the Congress’s laws.”  91 F. 4th, at 1191.  In the court’s view, the fact that Trump’s actions “allegedly violated generally applicable criminal laws” meant that those actions “were not properly within the scope of his lawful discretion.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 1192.  The D.&nbsp;C. Circuit thus concluded that Trump had “no structural immunity from the charges in the Indictment.”  <em>Ibid.</em>  Like the District Court, the D.&nbsp;C. &nbsp;Circuit declined to analyze the actions described in the indictment to determine whether they involved official acts.  See <em>id.</em>, at 1205, n.&nbsp;14.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> We granted certiorari to consider the following question: “Whether and if so to what extent does a former President enjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office.”  601 U.&nbsp;S. ___ (2024).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">II</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> This case is the first criminal prosecution in our Nation’s history of a former President for actions taken during his Presidency.  We are called upon to consider whether and under what circumstances such a prosecution may proceed.&nbsp; Doing so requires careful assessment of the scope of Presidential power under the Constitution.  We undertake that responsibility conscious that we must not confuse “the issue of a power’s validity with the cause it is invoked to promote,” but must instead focus on the “enduring consequences upon the balanced power structure of our Republic.”  <em>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co.</em> v. <em>Sawyer</em>, <a aria-label=\"343 U. S. 579\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/343/579\">343 U.&nbsp;S. 579</a>, 634 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The parties before us do not dispute that a former President can be subject to criminal prosecution for unofficial acts committed while in office.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 28.  They also agree that some of the conduct described in the indictment includes actions taken by Trump in his unofficial capacity.  See <em>id</em>., at 28–30, 36–37, 124.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> They disagree, however, about whether a former President can be prosecuted for his official actions.  Trump contends that just as a President is absolutely immune from civil damages liability for acts within the outer perimeter of his official responsibilities, <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 756, he must be absolutely immune from criminal prosecution for such acts.  Brief for Petitioner 10.  And Trump argues that the bulk of the indictment’s allegations involve conduct in &nbsp;his official capacity as President.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 30–32.  Although the Government agrees that some official actions are included in the indictment’s allegations, see <em>id.</em>, at 125, it maintains that a former President does not enjoy immunity from criminal prosecution for any actions, regardless of how they are characterized.  See Brief for United States&nbsp;9.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> We conclude that under our constitutional structure of separated powers, the nature of Presidential power requires that a former President have some immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts during his tenure in office.  At least with respect to the President’s exercise of his core constitutional powers, this immunity must be absolute.  As for his remaining official actions, he is also entitled to immunity.  At the current stage of proceedings in this case, however, we need not and do not decide whether that immunity must be absolute, or instead whether a presumptive immunity is sufficient.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">A</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Article II of the Constitution provides that “[t]he executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.”  §1, cl.&nbsp;1.  The President’s duties are of “unrivaled gravity and breadth.”  <em>Trump</em> v. <em>Vance</em>, <a aria-label=\"591 U. S. 786\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/591/786\">591 U.&nbsp;S. 786</a>, 800 (2020).  They include, for instance, commanding the Armed Forces of the United States; granting reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States; and appointing public ministers and consuls, the Justices of this Court, and Officers of the United States.  See §2.  He also has important foreign relations responsibilities: making treaties, appointing ambassadors, recognizing foreign governments, meeting foreign leaders, overseeing international diplomacy and intelligence gathering, and managing matters related to terrorism, trade, and immigration.  See §§2, 3.  Domestically, he must “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,” §3, and he bears responsibility for the &nbsp;actions of the many departments and agencies within the Executive Branch.  He also plays a role in lawmaking by recommending to Congress the measures he thinks wise and signing or vetoing the bills Congress passes.  See Art. I, §7, cl.&nbsp;2; Art.&nbsp;II, §3.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> No matter the context, the President’s authority to act necessarily “stem[s] either from an act of Congress or from the Constitution itself.”  <em>Youngstown</em>, 343 U.&nbsp;S., at 585.  In the latter case, the President’s authority is sometimes “conclusive and preclusive.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 638 (Jackson, J., concurring).  When the President exercises such authority, he may act even when the measures he takes are “incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress.”  <em>Id</em>., at 637.  The exclusive constitutional authority of the President “disabl[es] the Congress from acting upon the subject.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 637–638.  And the courts have “no power to control [the President’s] discretion” when he acts pursuant to the powers invested exclusively in him by the Constitution.  <em>Marbury</em>, 1 Cranch, at 166.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> If the President claims authority to act but in fact exercises mere “individual will” and “authority without law,” the courts may say so.  <em>Youngstown</em>, 343 U.&nbsp;S., at 655 (Jackson, J., concurring).  In <em>Youngstown</em>, for instance, we held that President Truman exceeded his constitutional authority when he seized most of the Nation’s steel mills.  See <em>id.</em>, at 582–589 (majority opinion).  But once it is determined that the President acted within the scope of his exclusive authority, his discretion in exercising such authority cannot be subject to further judicial examination.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Constitution, for example, vests the “Power to Grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States” in the President.  Art.&nbsp;II, §2, cl.&nbsp;1.  During and after the Civil War, President Lincoln offered a full pardon, with restoration of property rights, to anyone who had “engaged in the rebellion” but agreed to take an oath of allegiance to the Union.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Klein</em>, 13 Wall. 128, 139–141 &nbsp;(1872).  But in 1870, Congress enacted a provision that prohibited using the President’s pardon as evidence of restoration of property rights.  <em>Id.</em>, at 143–144.  Chief Justice Chase held the provision unconstitutional because it “impair[ed] the effect of a pardon, and thus infring[ed] the constitutional power of the Executive.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 147.  “To the executive alone is intrusted the power of pardon,” and the “legislature cannot change the effect of such a pardon any more than the executive can change a law.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 147–148.  The President’s authority to pardon, in other words, is “conclusive and preclusive,” “disabling the Congress from acting upon the subject.”  <em>Youngstown</em>, 343 U.&nbsp;S., at 637–638 (Jackson, J., concurring).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Some of the President’s other constitutional powers also fit that description.  “The President’s power to remove—and thus supervise—those who wield executive power on his behalf,” for instance, “follows from the text of Article II.”  <em>Seila Law LLC</em> v. <em>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</em>, <a aria-label=\"591 U. S. 197\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/591/197\">591 U.&nbsp;S. 197</a>, 204 (2020).  We have thus held that Congress lacks authority to control the President’s “unrestricted power of removal” with respect to “executive officers of the United States whom he has appointed.”  <em>Myers</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"272 U. S. 52\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/272/52\">272 U.&nbsp;S. 52</a>, 106, 176 (1926); see <em>Youngstown</em>, 343 U.&nbsp;S., at 638, n.&nbsp;4 (Jackson, J., concurring) (citing the President’s “exclusive power of removal in executive agencies” as an example of “conclusive and preclusive” constitutional authority); cf. <em>Seila Law</em>, 591 U.&nbsp;S., at 215 (noting only “two exceptions to the President’s unrestricted removal power”).  The power “to control recognition determinations” of foreign countries is likewise an “exclusive power of the President.”  <em>Zivotofsky</em> v. <em>Kerry</em>, <a aria-label=\"576 U. S. 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/576/1\">576 U.&nbsp;S. 1</a>, 32 (2015).  Congressional commands contrary to the President’s recognition determinations are thus invalid.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Congress cannot act on, and courts cannot examine, the President’s actions on subjects within his “conclusive and preclusive” constitutional authority.  It follows that an Act &nbsp;of Congress—either a specific one targeted at the President or a generally applicable one—may not criminalize the President’s actions within his exclusive constitutional power.  Neither may the courts adjudicate a criminal prosecution that examines such Presidential actions.  We thus conclude that the President is absolutely immune from criminal prosecution for conduct within his exclusive sphere of constitutional authority.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> But of course not all of the President’s official acts fall within his “conclusive and preclusive” authority.  As Justice Robert Jackson recognized in <em>Youngstown</em>, the President sometimes “acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of Congress,” or in a “zone of twilight” where “he and Congress may have concurrent authority.”  343 U.&nbsp;S., at 635, 637 (concurring opinion).  The reasons that justify the President’s absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for acts within the scope of his exclusive authority therefore do not extend to conduct in areas where his authority is shared with Congress.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> We recognize that only a limited number of our prior decisions guide determination of the President’s immunity in this context.  That is because proceedings directly involving a President have been uncommon in our Nation, and “decisions of the Court in this area” have accordingly been “rare” and “episodic.”  <em>Dames &amp; Moore</em> v. <em>Regan</em>, <a aria-label=\"453 U. S. 654\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/453/654\">453 U.&nbsp;S. 654</a>, 661 (1981).  To resolve the matter, therefore, we look primarily to the Framers’ design of the Presidency within the separation of powers, our precedent on Presidential immunity in the civil context, and our criminal cases where a President resisted prosecutorial demands for documents.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">1</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The President “occupies a unique position in the constitutional scheme,” <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 749, as “the only &nbsp;person who alone composes a branch of government,” <em>Trump</em> v. <em>Mazars</em> <em>USA, LLP</em>, <a aria-label=\"591 U. S. 848\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/591/848\">591 U.&nbsp;S. 848</a>, 868 (2020).  The Framers “sought to encourage energetic, vigorous, decisive, and speedy execution of the laws by placing in the hands of a single, constitutionally indispensable, individual the ultimate authority that, in respect to the other branches, the Constitution divides among many.”  <em>Clinton</em> v. <em>Jones</em>, <a aria-label=\"520 U. S. 681\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/520/681\">520 U.&nbsp;S. 681</a>, 712 (1997) (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment).  They “deemed an energetic executive essential to ‘the protection of the community against foreign attacks,’ ‘the steady administration of the laws,’ ‘the protection of property,’ and ‘the security of liberty.’&nbsp;”  <em>Seila Law</em>, 591 U.&nbsp;S., at 223–224 (quoting The Federalist No. 70, p.&nbsp;471 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton)).  The purpose of a “vigorous” and “energetic” Executive, they thought, was to ensure “good government,” for a “feeble executive implies a feeble execution of the government.”  <em>Id</em>., at 471–472.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Framers accordingly vested the President with “supervisory and policy responsibilities of utmost discretion and sensitivity.”  <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 750.  He must make “the most sensitive and far-reaching decisions entrusted to any official under our constitutional system.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 752.  There accordingly “exists the greatest public interest” in providing the President with “&nbsp;‘the maximum ability to deal fearlessly and impartially with’ the duties of his office.”  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Ferri</em> v. <em>Ackerman</em>, <a aria-label=\"444 U. S. 193\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/444/193\">444 U.&nbsp;S. 193</a>, 203 (1979)).  Appreciating the “unique risks to the effective functioning of government” that arise when the President’s energies are diverted by proceedings that might render him “unduly cautious in the discharge of his official duties,” we have recognized Presidential immunities and privileges “rooted in the constitutional tradition of the separation of powers and supported by our history.”  <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 749, 751, 752, n.&nbsp;32.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In <em>Nixon </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald</em>, for instance, we recognized that as “a functionally mandated incident of [his] unique office,” &nbsp;a former President “is entitled to absolute immunity from damages liability predicated on his official acts.”  <em>Id</em>., at 749.  That case involved a terminated Air Force employee who sued former President Richard Nixon for damages, alleging that Nixon approved an Air Force reorganization that wrongfully led to his firing.  In holding that Nixon was immune from that suit, “our dominant concern” was to avoid “diversion of the President’s attention during the decisionmaking process caused by needless worry as to the possibility of damages actions stemming from any particular official decision.”  <em>Clinton</em>, 520 U.&nbsp;S., at 694, n.&nbsp;19.  “[T]he singular importance of the President’s duties” implicating “matters likely to ‘arouse the most intense feelings,’&nbsp;” coupled with “the sheer prominence of [his] office,” heightens the prospect of private damages suits that would threaten such diversion.  <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 751–753 (quoting <em>Pierson</em> v. <em>Ray</em>, <a aria-label=\"386 U. S. 547\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/386/547\">386 U.&nbsp;S. 547</a>, 554 (1967)).  We therefore concluded that the President must be absolutely immune from “damages liability for acts within the ‘outer perimeter’ of his official responsibility.”  <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 756.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> By contrast, when prosecutors have sought evidence from the President, we have consistently rejected Presidential claims of absolute immunity.  For instance, during the treason trial of former Vice President Aaron Burr, Chief Justice Marshall rejected President Thomas Jefferson’s claim that the President could not be subjected to a subpoena.  Marshall reasoned that “the law does not discriminate between the president and a private citizen.”  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Burr</em>, 25 F.&nbsp;Cas. 30, 34 (No. 14,692d) (CC Va. 1807) (<em>Burr I</em>).  Because a President does not “stand exempt from the general provisions of the constitution,” including the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution sixth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment\">Sixth Amendment</a>’s guarantee that those accused shall have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses for their defense, a subpoena could issue.  <em>Id.</em>, at 33–34.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Marshall acknowledged, however, the existence of a &nbsp;“privilege” to withhold certain “official paper[s]” that “ought not on light ground to be forced into public view.”  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Burr</em>, 25 F.&nbsp;Cas. 187, 192 (No. 14,694) (CC Va. 1807) (<em>Burr II</em>); see also <em>Burr I</em>, 25 F.&nbsp;Cas., at 37 (stating that nothing before the court showed that the document in question “contain[ed] any matter the disclosure of which would endanger the public safety”).  And he noted that a court may not “be required to proceed against the president as against an ordinary individual.”  <em>Burr II</em>, 25 F.&nbsp;Cas., at 192.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Similarly, when a subpoena issued to President Nixon to produce certain tape recordings and documents relating to his conversations with aides and advisers, this Court rejected his claim of “absolute privilege,” given the “constitutional duty of the Judicial Branch to do justice in criminal prosecutions.”  <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nixon</em>, <a aria-label=\"418 U. S. 683\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/418/683\">418 U.&nbsp;S. 683</a>, 703, 707 (1974).  But we simultaneously recognized “the public interest in candid, objective, and even blunt or harsh opinions in Presidential decisionmaking,” as well as the need to protect “communications between high Government officials and those who advise and assist them in the performance of their manifold duties.”  <em>Id</em>., at 705, 708.  Because the President’s “need for complete candor and objectivity from advisers calls for great deference from the courts,” we held that a “presumptive privilege” protects Presidential communications.  <em>Id</em>., at 706, 708.  That privilege, we explained, “relates to the effective discharge of a President’s powers.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 711.  We thus deemed it “fundamental to the operation of Government and inextricably rooted in the separation of powers under the Constitution.”  <em>Id</em>., at 708.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">2</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Criminally prosecuting a President for official conduct undoubtedly poses a far greater threat of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch than simply seeking evidence in his possession, as in <em>Burr</em> and <em>Nixon</em>.  The danger is akin to, indeed greater than, what led us to recognize absolute Presidential immunity from civil damages liability—that the President would be chilled from taking the “bold and unhesitating action” required of an independent Executive.  <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 745.  Although the President might be exposed to fewer criminal prosecutions than the range of civil damages suits that might be brought by various plaintiffs, the threat of trial, judgment, and imprisonment is a far greater deterrent.  Potential criminal liability, and the peculiar public opprobrium that attaches to criminal proceedings, are plainly more likely to distort Presidential decisionmaking than the potential payment of civil damages.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The hesitation to execute the duties of his office fearlessly and fairly that might result when a President is making decisions under “a pall of potential prosecution,” <em>McDonnell</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"579 U. S. 550\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/579/550\">579 U.&nbsp;S. 550</a>, 575 (2016), raises “unique risks to the effective functioning of government,” <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 751.  A President inclined to take one course of action based on the public interest may instead opt for another, apprehensive that criminal penalties may befall him upon his departure from office.  And if a former President’s official acts are routinely subjected to scrutiny in criminal prosecutions, “the independence of the Executive Branch” may be significantly undermined.  <em>Vance</em>, 591 U.&nbsp;S., at 800.  The Framers’ design of the Presidency did not envision such counterproductive burdens on the “vigor[&nbsp;]” and “energy” of the Executive.  The Federalist No. 70, at 471–472.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> We must, however, “recognize[&nbsp;] the countervailing interests at stake.”  <em>Vance</em>, 591 U.&nbsp;S., at 799.  Federal criminal laws seek to redress “a wrong to the public” as a whole, not just “a wrong to the individual.”  <em>Huntington</em> v. <em>Attrill</em>, <a aria-label=\"146 U. S. 657\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/146/657\">146 U.&nbsp;S. 657</a>, 668 (1892).  There is therefore a compelling “public interest in fair and effective law enforcement.”  <em>Vance</em>, 591 U.&nbsp;S., at 808.  The President, charged with enforcing &nbsp;federal criminal laws, is not above them.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Chief Justice Marshall’s decisions in <em>Burr</em> and our decision in <em>Nixon</em> recognized the distinct interests present in criminal prosecutions.  Although <em>Burr</em> acknowledged that the President’s official papers may be privileged and publicly unavailable, it did not grant him an absolute exemption from responding to subpoenas.  See <em>Burr II</em>, 25 F.&nbsp;Cas., at 192; <em>Burr I</em>, 25 F.&nbsp;Cas., at 33–34.  <em>Nixon</em> likewise recognized a strong protection for the President’s confidential communications—a “presumptive privilege”—but it did not entirely exempt him from providing evidence in criminal proceedings.  418 U.&nbsp;S., at 708.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Taking into account these competing considerations, we conclude that the separation of powers principles explicated in our precedent necessitate at least a <em>presumptive</em> immunity from criminal prosecution for a President’s acts within the outer perimeter of his official responsibility.  Such an immunity is required to safeguard the independence and effective functioning of the Executive Branch, and to enable the President to carry out his constitutional duties without undue caution.  Indeed, if presumptive protection for the President is necessary to enable the “effective discharge” of his powers when a prosecutor merely seeks evidence of his official papers and communications, <em>id.</em>, at 711, it is certainly necessary when the prosecutor seeks to charge, try, and imprison the President himself for his official actions.  At a minimum, the President must therefore be immune from prosecution for an official act unless the Government can show that applying a criminal prohibition to that act would pose no “dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.”  <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 754.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> But as we explain below, the current stage of the proceedings in this case does not require us to decide whether this immunity is presumptive or absolute.  See Part III–B,<em> infra</em>.  Because we need not decide that question today, we do not &nbsp;decide it.  “[O]ne case” in more than “two centuries does not afford enough experience” to definitively and comprehensively determine the President’s scope of immunity from criminal prosecution.  <em>Mazars</em>, 591 U.&nbsp;S., at 871.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">C</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> As for a President’s unofficial acts, there is no immunity.  The principles we set out in <em>Clinton</em> v. <em>Jones</em> confirm as much.  When Paula Jones brought a civil lawsuit against then-President Bill Clinton for acts he allegedly committed prior to his Presidency, we rejected his argument that he enjoyed temporary immunity from the lawsuit while serving as President.  520 U.&nbsp;S., at 684.  Although Presidential immunity is required for <em>official</em> actions to ensure that the President’s decisionmaking is not distorted by the threat of future litigation stemming from those actions, that concern does not support immunity for <em>unofficial</em> conduct.  <em>Id.</em>, at 694, and n.&nbsp;19.  The “&nbsp;‘justifying purposes’&nbsp;” of the immunity we recognized in <em>Fitzgerald</em>, and the one we recognize today, are not that the President must be immune because he is the President; rather, they are to ensure that the President can undertake his constitutionally designated functions effectively, free from undue pressures or distortions.  520 U.&nbsp;S., at 694, and n.&nbsp;19 (quoting <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 755).  “[I]t [is] the nature of the function performed, not the identity of the actor who perform[s] it, that inform[s] our immunity analysis.”  <em>Forrester</em> v. <em>White</em>, <a aria-label=\"484 U. S. 219\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/484/219\">484 U.&nbsp;S. 219</a>, 229 (1988).  The separation of powers does not bar a prosecution predicated on the President’s unofficial acts.<a aria-label=\"reference 2 of Roberts Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-2\" id=\"OPINION_4-2ref\"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">&nbsp;III</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Determining whether a former President is entitled to immunity from a particular prosecution requires applying the principles we have laid out to his conduct at issue.  The first step is to distinguish his official from unofficial actions.  In this case, however, no court has thus far considered how to draw that distinction, in general or with respect to the conduct alleged in particular.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Despite the unprecedented nature of this case, and the very significant constitutional questions that it raises, the lower courts rendered their decisions on a highly expedited basis.  Because those courts categorically rejected <em>any</em> form of Presidential immunity, they did not analyze the conduct alleged in the indictment to decide which of it should be categorized as official and which unofficial.  Neither party has briefed that issue before us (though they discussed it at oral argument in response to questions).  And like the underlying immunity question, that categorization raises multiple unprecedented and momentous questions about the powers of the President and the limits of his authority under the Constitution.  As we have noted, there is little pertinent precedent on those subjects to guide our review of this case—a case that we too are deciding on an expedited basis, less than five months after we granted the Government’s request to construe Trump’s emergency application for a stay as a petition for certiorari, grant that petition, and answer the consequential immunity question.  See 601 U.&nbsp;S., at ___.  Given all these circumstances, it is particularly incumbent upon us to be mindful of our frequent admonition that “[o]urs is a court of final review and not first view.”  <em>Zivotofsky</em> v. <em>Clinton</em>, <a aria-label=\"566 U. S. 189\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/566/189\">566 U.&nbsp;S. 189</a>, 201 (2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"><em> </em>Critical threshold issues in this case are how to differentiate between a President’s official and unofficial actions, and how to do so with respect to the indictment’s extensive and detailed allegations covering a broad range of conduct.  &nbsp;We offer guidance on those issues below.  Certain allegations—such as those involving Trump’s discussions with the Acting Attorney General—are readily categorized in light of the nature of the President’s official relationship to the office held by that individual.  Other allegations—such as those involving Trump’s interactions with the Vice President, state officials, and certain private parties, and his comments to the general public—present more difficult questions.  Although we identify several considerations pertinent to classifying those allegations and determining whether they are subject to immunity, that analysis ultimately is best left to the lower courts to perform in the first instance.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">A</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Distinguishing the President’s official actions from his unofficial ones can be difficult.  When the President acts pursuant to “constitutional and statutory authority,” he takes official action to perform the functions of his office.  <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 757.  Determining whether an action is covered by immunity thus begins with assessing the President’s authority to take that action.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> But the breadth of the President’s “discretionary responsibilities” under the Constitution and laws of the United States “in a broad variety of areas, many of them highly sensitive,” frequently makes it “difficult to determine which of [his] innumerable ‘functions’ encompassed a particular action.”  <em>Id</em>., at 756.  And some Presidential conduct—for example, speaking to and on behalf of the American people, see <em>Trump</em> v. <em>Hawaii</em>, <a aria-label=\"585 U. S. 667\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/585/667\">585 U.&nbsp;S. 667</a>, 701 (2018)—certainly can qualify as official even when not obviously connected to a particular constitutional or statutory provision.  For those reasons, the immunity we have recognized extends to the “outer perimeter” of the President’s official responsibilities, covering actions so long as they are “not manifestly or palpably beyond [his] authority.”  <em>Blassingame</em> v. <em>Trump</em>, 87 &nbsp;F.&nbsp;4th 1, 13 (CADC 2023) (internal quotation marks omitted); see <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 755–756 (noting that we have “refused to draw functional lines finer than history and reason would support”).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In dividing official from unofficial conduct, courts may not inquire into the President’s motives.  Such an inquiry would risk exposing even the most obvious instances of official conduct to judicial examination on the mere allegation of improper purpose, thereby intruding on the Article II interests that immunity seeks to protect.  Indeed, “[i]t would seriously cripple the proper and effective administration of public affairs as entrusted to the executive branch of the government” if “[i]n exercising the functions of his office,” the President was “under an apprehension that the motives that control his official conduct may, at any time, become the subject of inquiry.”  <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 745 (quoting <em>Spalding</em> v. <em>Vilas</em>, <a aria-label=\"161 U. S. 483\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/161/483\">161 U.&nbsp;S. 483</a>, 498 (1896)).  We thus rejected such inquiries in <em>Fitzgerald</em>.  The plaintiff there contended that he was dismissed from the Air Force for retaliatory reasons.  See 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 733–741, 756.  The Air Force responded that the reorganization that led to Fitzgerald’s dismissal was undertaken to promote efficiency.  <em>Ibid.  </em>Because under Fitzgerald’s theory “an inquiry into the President’s motives could not be avoided,” we rejected the theory, observing that “[i]nquiries of this kind could be highly intrusive.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 756.  “[B]are allegations of malice should not suffice to subject government officials either to the costs of trial or to the burdens of broad-reaching discovery.”  <em>Harlow</em> v. <em>Fitzgerald</em>, <a aria-label=\"457 U. S. 800\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/457/800\">457 U.&nbsp;S. 800</a>, 817–818 (1982).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Nor may courts deem an action unofficial merely because it allegedly violates a generally applicable law.  For instance, when Fitzgerald contended that his dismissal violated various congressional statutes and thus rendered his discharge “outside the outer perimeter of [Nixon’s] duties,” we rejected that contention.  457 U.&nbsp;S., at 756<em>.  </em>Otherwise, Presidents would be subject to trial on “every allegation &nbsp;that an action was unlawful,” depriving immunity of its intended effect.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> With these principles in mind, we turn to the conduct alleged in the indictment.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">1</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The indictment broadly alleges that Trump and his co-conspirators sought to “overturn the legitimate results of the 2020 presidential election.”  App. 183, Indictment ¶7.  It charges that they conspired to obstruct the January 6 congressional proceeding at which electoral votes are counted and certified, and the winner of the election is certified as President-elect.  <em>Id</em>., at 181–185, ¶¶4, 7, 9.  As part of this conspiracy, Trump and his co-conspirators allegedly attempted to leverage the Justice Department’s power and authority to convince certain States to replace their legitimate electors with Trump’s fraudulent slates of electors.  See <em>id</em>., at 215–220, ¶¶70–85.  According to the indictment, Trump met with the Acting Attorney General and other senior Justice Department and White House officials to discuss investigating purported election fraud and sending a letter from the Department to those States regarding such fraud.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>id.</em>, at 217, 219–220, ¶¶77, 84.  The indictment further alleges that after the Acting Attorney General resisted Trump’s requests, Trump repeatedly threatened to replace him.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>id</em>., at 216–217, ¶¶74, 77.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Government does not dispute that the indictment’s allegations regarding the Justice Department involve Trump’s “use of official power.”  Brief for United States 46; see <em>id.</em>, at 10–11; Tr. of Oral Arg. 125.  The allegations in fact plainly implicate Trump’s “conclusive and preclusive” authority.  “[I]nvestigation and prosecution of crimes is a quintessentially executive function.”  Brief for United States 19 (quoting <em>Morrison</em> v. <em>Olson</em>, <a aria-label=\"487 U. S. 654\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/487/654\">487 U.&nbsp;S. 654</a>, 706 &nbsp;(1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting)).  And the Executive Branch has “exclusive authority and absolute discretion” to decide which crimes to investigate and prosecute, including with respect to allegations of election crime.  <em>Nixon</em>, 418 U.&nbsp;S., at 693; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Texas</em>, <a aria-label=\"599 U. S. 670\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/599/670\">599 U.&nbsp;S. 670</a>, 678–679 (2023) (“Under Article II, the Executive Branch possesses authority to decide ‘how to prioritize and how aggressively to pursue legal actions against defendants who violate the law.’&nbsp;” (quoting <em>TransUnion LLC</em> v. <em>Ramirez</em>, <a aria-label=\"594 U. S. 413\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/594/413\">594 U.&nbsp;S. 413</a>, 429 (2021))).  The President may discuss potential investigations and prosecutions with his Attorney General and other Justice Department officials to carry out his constitutional duty to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.”  Art.&nbsp;II, §3.  And the Attorney General, as head of the Justice Department, acts as the President’s “chief law enforcement officer” who “provides vital assistance to [him] in the performance of [his] constitutional duty to ‘preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution.’&nbsp;”  <em>Mitchell</em> v. <em>Forsyth</em>, <a aria-label=\"472 U. S. 511\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/472/511\">472 U.&nbsp;S. 511</a>, 520 (1985) (quoting Art. II, §1, cl.&nbsp;8).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Investigative and prosecutorial decisionmaking is “the special province of the Executive Branch,” <em>Heckler</em> v. <em>Chaney</em>, <a aria-label=\"470 U. S. 821\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/470/821\">470 U.&nbsp;S. 821</a>, 832 (1985), and the Constitution vests the entirety of the executive power in the President, Art. II, §1.  For that reason, Trump’s threatened removal of the Acting Attorney General likewise implicates “conclusive and preclusive” Presidential authority.  As we have explained, the President’s power to remove “executive officers of the United States whom he has appointed” may not be regulated by Congress or reviewed by the courts.  <em>Myers</em>, 272 U.&nbsp;S., at 106, 176; see <em>supra</em>, at 8.  The President’s “management of the Executive Branch” requires him to have “unrestricted power to remove the most important of his subordinates”—such as the Attorney General—“in their most important duties.”  <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 750 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; The indictment’s allegations that the requested investigations were “sham[s]” or proposed for an improper purpose do not divest the President of exclusive authority over the investigative and prosecutorial functions of the Justice Department and its officials.  App. 186–187, Indictment ¶10(c).  And the President cannot be prosecuted for conduct within his exclusive constitutional authority.  Trump is therefore absolutely immune from prosecution for the alleged conduct involving his discussions with Justice Department officials.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">2</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The indictment next alleges that Trump and his co-conspirators “attempted to enlist the Vice President to use his ceremonial role at the January 6 certification proceeding to fraudulently alter the election results.”  <em>Id</em>., at 187, ¶10(d).  In particular, the indictment alleges several conversations in which Trump pressured the Vice President to reject States’ legitimate electoral votes or send them back to state legislatures for review.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>id</em>., at 222–224, 226, ¶¶90, 92–93, 97.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Government explained at oral argument that although it “has not yet had to come to grips with how [it] would analyze” Trump’s interactions with the Vice President, there is “support” to characterize that conduct as official.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 128.  Indeed, our constitutional system anticipates that the President and Vice President will remain in close contact regarding their official duties over the course of the President’s term in office.  These two officials are the only ones “elected by the entire Nation.”  <em>Seila Law</em>, 591 U.&nbsp;S., at 224; see Art. II, §1.  The Constitution provides that “the Vice President shall become President” in the case of “the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation.”  Amdt. 25, §1.  It also “empowers the Vice President, together with a majority of the ‘principal officers &nbsp;of the executive departments,’ to declare the President ‘unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.’&nbsp;”  <em>Freytag</em> v. <em>Commissioner</em>, <a aria-label=\"501 U. S. 868\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/501/868\">501 U.&nbsp;S. 868</a>, 886–887 (1991) (quoting Amdt. 25, §4).  And Article I of course names the Vice President as President of the Senate and gives him a tiebreaking vote.  §3, cl.&nbsp;4.  It is thus important for the President to discuss official matters with the Vice President to ensure continuity within the Executive Branch and to advance the President’s agenda in Congress and beyond.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Vice President may in practice also serve as one of the President’s closest advisers.  The Office of Legal Counsel has explained that within the Executive Branch, the Vice President’s “sole function [is] advising and assisting the President.”  Whether the Office of the Vice President Is an ‘Agency’ for Purposes of the Freedom of Information Act, 18 Op. OLC 10 (1994).  Indeed, the “<a href=\"/constitution\">Twelfth Amendment</a> was brought about” to avoid the “manifestly intolerable” situation that occurred “[d]uring the John Adams administration,” when “we had a President and Vice-President of different parties.”  <em>Ray</em> v. <em>Blair</em>, <a aria-label=\"343 U. S. 214\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/343/214\">343 U.&nbsp;S. 214</a>, 224, n.&nbsp;11 (1952).  The President and Vice President together “are the senior officials of the Executive Branch of government” and therefore “must formulate, explain, advocate, and defend policies” of the President’s administration.  Payment of Expenses Associated With Travel by the President and Vice President, 6 Op. OLC 214, 215 (1982).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> As the President’s second in command, the Vice President has historically performed important functions “at the will and as the representative of the President.”  Participation of the Vice President in the Affairs of the Executive Branch, 1 Supp. Op. OLC 214, 220 (1961).  President Woodrow Wilson’s Vice President, for instance, “presided over a few cabinet meetings while Wilson was in France negotiating” the Treaty of Versailles after World War I.  H. Relyea, The Law: The Executive Office of the Vice President: Constitutional and Legal Considerations, 40 Presidential Studies Q. 327, &nbsp;328 (2010).  During President Franklin Roosevelt’s administration, the Vice President “became a regular participant in cabinet deliberations—a practice that was continued by each succeeding president.”  <em>Ibid.</em>  And when President Dwight Eisenhower “suffered three major illnesses while in office .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Vice President Richard Nixon consulted with the Cabinet and developed a procedure for relaying important matters to the President.”  Presidential Succession and Delegation in Case of Disability, 5 Op. OLC 91, 102 (1981).  At the President’s discretion, “the Vice President may engage in activities ranging into the highest levels of diplomacy and negotiation and may do so anywhere in the world.”  1 Supp. Op. OLC, at 220.  Domestically, he may act as the President’s delegate to perform any duties “co-extensive with the scope of the President’s power of delegation.”  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Whenever the President and Vice President discuss their official responsibilities, they engage in official conduct.  Presiding over the January 6 certification proceeding at which Members of Congress count the electoral votes is a constitutional and statutory duty of the Vice President.  Art.&nbsp;II, §1, cl.&nbsp;3; Amdt. 12; <a aria-label=\"3 USC 15\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/15\">3 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §15</a>.  The indictment’s allegations that Trump attempted to pressure the Vice President to take particular acts in connection with his role at the certification proceeding thus involve official conduct, and Trump is at least presumptively immune from prosecution for such conduct.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The question then becomes whether that presumption of immunity is rebutted under the circumstances.  When the Vice President presides over the January 6 certification proceeding, he does so in his capacity as President of the Senate.  <em>Ibid.  </em>Despite the Vice President’s expansive role of advising and assisting the President within the Executive Branch, the Vice President’s Article I responsibility of “presiding over the Senate” is “not an ‘executive branch’ function.”  Memorandum from L. Silberman, Deputy Atty. Gen., to R. Burress, Office of the President, Re: Conflict of &nbsp;Interest Problems Arising Out of the President’s Nomination of Nelson A. Rockefeller To Be Vice President Under the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution Amendment xxv\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxxv\">Twenty-Fifth Amendment</a> to the Constitution 2 (Aug. 28, 1974).  With respect to the certification proceeding in particular, Congress has legislated extensively to define the Vice President’s role in the counting of the electoral votes, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <a aria-label=\"3 USC 15\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/15\">3 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §15</a>, and the President plays no direct constitutional or statutory role in that process.  So the Government may argue that consideration of the President’s communications with the Vice President concerning the certification proceeding does not pose “dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.”  <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 754; see <em>supra</em>, at 14.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> At the same time, however, the President may frequently rely on the Vice President in his capacity as President of the Senate to advance the President’s agenda in Congress.  When the Senate is closely divided, for instance, the Vice President’s tiebreaking vote may be crucial for confirming the President’s nominees and passing laws that align with the President’s policies.  Applying a criminal prohibition to the President’s conversations discussing such matters with the Vice President—even though they concern his role as President of the Senate—may well hinder the President’s ability to perform his constitutional functions.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> It is ultimately the Government’s burden to rebut the presumption of immunity.  We therefore remand to the District Court to assess in the first instance, with appropriate input from the parties, whether a prosecution involving Trump’s alleged attempts to influence the Vice President’s oversight of the certification proceeding in his capacity as President of the Senate would pose any dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">3</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The indictment’s remaining allegations cover a broad range of conduct.  Unlike the allegations describing &nbsp;Trump’s communications with the Justice Department and the Vice President, these remaining allegations involve Trump’s interactions with persons outside the Executive Branch: state officials, private parties, and the general public.  Many of the remaining allegations, for instance, cover at great length events arising out of communications that Trump and his co-conspirators initiated with state legislators and election officials in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin regarding those States’ certification of electors.  See App. 192–207, Indictment ¶¶13–52.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Specifically, the indictment alleges that Trump and his co-conspirators attempted to convince those officials that election fraud had tainted the popular vote count in their States, and thus electoral votes for Trump’s opponent needed to be changed to electoral votes for Trump.  See <em>id</em>., at 185–186, ¶10(a).  After Trump failed to convince those officials to alter their state processes, he and his co-conspirators allegedly developed a plan “to marshal individuals who would have served as [Trump’s] electors, had he won the popular vote” in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, “and cause those individuals to make and send to the Vice President and Congress false certifications that they were legitimate electors.”  <em>Id</em>., at 208, ¶53.  If the plan worked, “the submission of these fraudulent slates” would position the Vice President to “open and count the fraudulent votes” at the certification proceeding and set up “a fake controversy that would derail the proper certification of Biden as president-elect.”  <em>Id</em>., at 208–209, ¶¶53, 54(b).  According to the indictment, Trump used his campaign staff to effectuate the plan. <em> </em>See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>id</em>., at 210, 212–213, ¶¶55, 63.  On the same day that the legitimate electors met in their respective jurisdictions to cast their votes, the indictment alleges that Trump’s “fraudulent electors convened sham proceedings in the seven tar&nbsp;geted states to cast fraudulent electoral ballots” in his favor.  <em>Id</em>., at 214, ¶66.  Those ballots “were mailed to the President of the Senate, the Archivist of the United States, and others.”  <em>Ibid</em>., ¶67.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> At oral argument, Trump appeared to concede that at least some of these acts—those involving “private actors” who “helped implement a plan to submit fraudulent slates of presidential electors to obstruct the certification proceeding” at the direction of Trump and a co-conspirator—entail “private” conduct.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 29–30.  He later asserted, however, that asking “the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to gather electors” qualifies as official conduct because “the organization of alternate slates of electors is based on, for example, the historical example of President Grant as something that was done pursuant to and ancillary and preparatory to the exercise of&nbsp;” a core Presidential power.  <em>Id.</em>, at 37; see also <em>id.</em>, at 25 (discussing the “historical precedent .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of President Grant sending federal troops to Louisiana and Mississippi in 1876 to make sure that the Republican electors got certified in those two cases, which delivered the election to Rutherford B. Hayes”).  He also argued that it is “[a]bsolutely an official act for the president to communicate with state officials on .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the integrity of a federal election.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 38.  The Government disagreed, contending that this alleged conduct does not qualify as “official conduct” but as “campaign conduct.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 124–125.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> On Trump’s view, the alleged conduct qualifies as official because it was undertaken to ensure the integrity and proper administration of the federal election.  Of course, the President’s duty to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed” plainly encompasses enforcement of federal election laws passed by Congress.  Art.&nbsp;II, §3.  And the President’s broad power to speak on matters of public concern does not exclude his public communications regarding the fairness and integrity of federal elections simply because he &nbsp;is running for re-election.  Cf. <em>Hawaii</em>, 585 U.&nbsp;S., at 701.  Similarly, the President may speak on and discuss such matters with state officials—even when no specific federal responsibility requires his communication—to encourage them to act in a manner that promotes the President’s view of the public good.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> As the Government sees it, however, these allegations encompass nothing more than Trump’s “private scheme with private actors.”  Brief for United States 44.  In its view, Trump can point to no plausible source of authority enabling the President to not only organize alternate slates of electors but also cause those electors—unapproved by any state official—to transmit votes to the President of the Senate for counting at the certification proceeding, thus interfering with the votes of States’ properly appointed electors.  Indeed, the Constitution commits to the States the power to “appoint” Presidential electors “in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct.”  Art.&nbsp;II, §1, cl.&nbsp;2; see <em>Burroughs </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"290 U. S. 534\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/290/534\">290 U.&nbsp;S. 534</a>, 544 (1934).  “Article II, §1’s appointments power,” we have said, “gives the States far-reaching authority over presidential electors, absent some other constitutional constraint.”  <em>Chiafalo</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a aria-label=\"591 U. S. 578\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/591/578\">591 U.&nbsp;S. 578</a>, 588–589 (2020).  By contrast, the Federal Government’s role in appointing electors is limited.  Congress may prescribe when the state-appointed electors shall meet, and it counts and certifies their votes.  Art. II, §1, cls. 3, 4.  The President, meanwhile, plays no direct role in the process, nor does he have authority to control the state officials who do.  And the Framers, wary of “cabal, intrigue and corruption,” specifically excluded from service as electors “all those who from situation might be suspected of too great devotion to the president in office.”  The Federalist No. 68, at 459 (A. Hamilton); see Art. II, §1, cl.&nbsp;2.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Determining whose characterization may be correct, and with respect to which conduct, requires a close analysis of &nbsp;the indictment’s extensive and interrelated allegations.  See App. 192–215, Indictment ¶¶13–69.  Unlike Trump’s alleged interactions with the Justice Department, this alleged conduct cannot be neatly categorized as falling within a particular Presidential function.  The necessary analysis is instead fact specific, requiring assessment of numerous alleged interactions with a wide variety of state officials and private persons.  And the parties’ brief comments at oral argument indicate that they starkly disagree on the characterization of these allegations.  The concerns we noted at the outset—the expedition of this case, the lack of factual analysis by the lower courts, and the absence of pertinent briefing by the parties—thus become more prominent.  We accordingly remand to the District Court to determine in the first instance—with the benefit of briefing we lack—whether Trump’s conduct in this area qualifies as official or unofficial.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">4</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Finally, the indictment contains various allegations regarding Trump’s conduct in connection with the events of January 6 itself.  It alleges that leading up to the January 6 certification proceeding, Trump issued a series of Tweets (to his nearly 89 million followers) encouraging his supporters to travel to Washington, D.&nbsp;C., on that day.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, App. 221, 225–227, Indictment ¶¶87–88, 96, 100.  Trump and his co-conspirators addressed the gathered public that morning, asserting that certain States wanted to recertify their electoral votes and that the Vice President had the power to send those States’ ballots back for recertification.  <em>Id.</em>, at 228–230, ¶¶103–104.  Trump then allegedly “directed the crowd in front of him to go to the Capitol” to pressure the Vice President to do so at the certification proceeding.  <em>Id.</em>, at 228–230, ¶104.  When it became public that the Vice President would not use his role at the certification proceeding to determine which electoral votes should be &nbsp;counted, the crowd gathered at the Capitol “broke through barriers cordoning off the Capitol grounds” and eventually “broke into the building.”  <em>Id</em>., at 230–231, ¶¶107, 109.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The alleged conduct largely consists of Trump’s communications in the form of Tweets and a public address.  The President possesses “extraordinary power to speak to his fellow citizens and on their behalf.”  <em>Hawaii</em>, 585 U.&nbsp;S., at 701; cf. <em>Lindke</em> v. <em>Freed</em>, <a aria-label=\"601 U. S. 187\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/601/187\">601 U.&nbsp;S. 187</a>, 191 (2024).  As the sole person charged by the Constitution with executing the laws of the United States, the President oversees—and thus will frequently speak publicly about—a vast array of activities that touch on nearly every aspect of American life.  Indeed, a long-recognized aspect of Presidential power is using the office’s “bully pulpit” to persuade Americans, including by speaking forcefully or critically, in ways that the President believes would advance the public interest.  He is even expected to comment on those matters of public concern that may not directly implicate the activities of the Federal Government—for instance, to comfort the Nation in the wake of an emergency or tragedy.  For these reasons, most of a President’s public communications are likely to fall comfortably within the outer perimeter of his official responsibilities.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> There may, however, be contexts in which the President, notwithstanding the prominence of his position, speaks in an unofficial capacity—perhaps as a candidate for office or party leader.  To the extent that may be the case, objective analysis of “content, form, and context” will necessarily inform the inquiry.  <em>Snyder</em> v. <em>Phelps</em>, <a aria-label=\"562 U. S. 443\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/562/443\">562 U.&nbsp;S. 443</a>, 453 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted).  But “there is not always a clear line between [the President’s] personal and official affairs.”  <em>Mazars</em>, 591 U.&nbsp;S., at 868.  The analysis therefore must be fact specific and may prove to be challenging.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The indictment reflects these challenges.  It includes only &nbsp;select Tweets and brief snippets of the speech Trump delivered on the morning of January 6, omitting its full text or context.  See App. 228–230, Indictment ¶104.  Whether the Tweets, that speech, and Trump’s other communications on January 6 involve official conduct may depend on the content and context of each.  Knowing, for instance, what else was said contemporaneous to the excerpted communications, or who was involved in transmitting the electronic communications and in organizing the rally, could be relevant to the classification of each communication.  This necessarily factbound analysis is best performed initially by the District Court.  We therefore remand to the District Court to determine in the first instance whether this alleged conduct is official or unofficial.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">C</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The essence of immunity “is its possessor’s entitlement not to have to answer for his conduct” in court.  <em>Mitchell</em>, 472 U.&nbsp;S., at 525.  Presidents therefore cannot be indicted based on conduct for which they are immune from prosecution.  As we have explained, the indictment here alleges at least some such conduct.  See Part III–B–1, <em>supra</em>.  On remand, the District Court must carefully analyze the indictment’s remaining allegations to determine whether they too involve conduct for which a President must be immune from prosecution.  And the parties and the District Court must ensure that sufficient allegations support the indictment’s charges without such conduct.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Government does not dispute that if Trump is entitled to immunity for certain official acts, he may not “be held criminally liable” based on those acts.  Brief for United States 46.  But it nevertheless contends that a jury could “consider” evidence concerning the President’s official acts “for limited and specified purposes,” and that such evidence would “be admissible to prove, for example, [Trump’s] knowledge or notice of the falsity of his election-fraud &nbsp;claims.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 46, 48.  That proposal threatens to eviscerate the immunity we have recognized.  It would permit a prosecutor to do indirectly what he cannot do directly—invite the jury to examine acts for which a President is immune from prosecution to nonetheless prove his liability on any charge.  But “[t]he Constitution deals with substance, not shadows.”  <em>Cummings</em> v. <em>Missouri</em>, 4 Wall. 277, 325 (1867).  And the Government’s position is untenable in light of the separation of powers principles we have outlined.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> If official conduct for which the President is immune may be scrutinized to help secure his conviction, even on charges that purport to be based only on his unofficial conduct, the “intended effect” of immunity would be defeated.  <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 756.  The President’s immune conduct would be subject to examination by a jury on the basis of generally applicable criminal laws.  Use of evidence about such conduct, even when an indictment alleges only unofficial conduct, would thereby heighten the prospect that the President’s official decisionmaking will be distorted.  See <em>Clinton</em>, 520 U.&nbsp;S., at 694, n.&nbsp;19.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Government asserts that these weighty concerns can be managed by the District Court through the use of “evidentiary rulings” and “jury instructions.”  Brief for United States 46.  But such tools are unlikely to protect adequately the President’s constitutional prerogatives.  Presidential acts frequently deal with “matters likely to ‘arouse the most intense feelings.’ &nbsp;”  <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 752 (quoting <em>Pierson</em>, 386 U.&nbsp;S., at 554).  Allowing prosecutors to ask or suggest that the jury probe official acts for which the President is immune would thus raise a unique risk that the jurors’ deliberations will be prejudiced by their views of the President’s policies and performance while in office.  The prosaic tools on which the Government would have courts rely are an inadequate safeguard against the peculiar constitutional concerns implicated in the prosecution of a former President.  Cf. <em>Nixon</em>, 418 U.&nbsp;S., at 706.  Although such &nbsp;tools may suffice to protect the constitutional rights of individual criminal defendants, the interests that underlie Presidential immunity seek to protect not the President himself, but the institution of the Presidency.<a aria-label=\"reference 3 of Roberts Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-3\" id=\"OPINION_4-3ref\"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">IV</h3>\n<h4 class=\"jy-center\">A</h4>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Trump asserts a far broader immunity than the limited one we have recognized.  He contends that the indictment must be dismissed because the Impeachment Judgment Clause requires that impeachment and Senate conviction precede a President’s criminal prosecution.  Brief for Petitioner 16.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The text of the Clause provides little support for such an absolute immunity.  It states that an impeachment judgment “shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States.”  Art. I, §3, cl.&nbsp;7.  It then specifies that “the Party convicted shall <em>nevertheless</em> be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.”  <em>Ibid</em>. (emphasis added).  &nbsp;The Clause both limits the consequences of an impeachment judgment and clarifies that notwithstanding such judgment, subsequent prosecution may proceed.  By its own terms, the Clause does not address whether and on what conduct a President may be prosecuted if he was never impeached and convicted.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Historical evidence likewise lends little support to Trump’s position.  For example, Justice Story reasoned that without the Clause’s clarification that “Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment” may nevertheless follow Senate conviction, “it might be matter of extreme doubt, whether .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a second trial for the same offence could be had, either after an acquittal, or a conviction in the court of impeachments.”  2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States §780, p.&nbsp;251 (1833).  James Wilson, who served on the Committee that drafted the Clause and later as a Justice of this Court, similarly concluded that acquittal of impeachment charges posed no bar to subsequent prosecution.  See 2 Documentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution 492 (M. Jensen ed. 1979).  And contrary to Trump’s contention, Alexander Hamilton did not disagree.  The Federalist Papers on which Trump relies, see Brief for Petitioner 17–18, concerned the checks available against a <em>sitting</em> President.  Hamilton noted that unlike “the King of Great-Britain,” the President “would be liable to be impeached” and “removed from office,” and “would afterwards be liable to prosecution and punishment.”  The Federalist No. 69, at 463; see also <em>id</em>., No. 77, at 520 (explaining that the President is “at all times liable to impeachment, trial, dismission from office .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and to the forfeiture of life and estate by subsequent prosecution”).  Hamilton did not endorse or even consider whether the Impeachment Judgment Clause immunizes a <em>former</em> President from prosecution.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The implication of Trump’s theory is that a President who evades impeachment for one reason or another during his &nbsp;term in office can never be held accountable for his criminal acts in the ordinary course of law.  So if a President manages to conceal certain crimes throughout his Presidency, or if Congress is unable to muster the political will to impeach the President for his crimes, then they must forever remain impervious to prosecution.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Impeachment is a political process by which Congress can remove a President who has committed “Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.”  Art.&nbsp;II, §4.  Transforming that political process into a necessary step in the enforcement of criminal law finds little support in the text of the Constitution or the structure of our Government.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The Government for its part takes a similarly broad view, contending that the President enjoys no immunity from criminal prosecution for any action.  It maintains this view despite agreeing with much of our analysis.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> For instance, the Government does not dispute that Congress may not criminalize Presidential conduct within the President’s “conclusive and preclusive” constitutional authority.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 133 (“[C]ore powers .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. can’t be regulated at all, like the pardon power and veto.”); see also <em>id.</em>, at 84–85.  And it too accords protection to Presidential conduct if subjecting that conduct to generally applicable laws would “raise serious constitutional questions regarding the President’s authority” or cause a “possible conflict with the President’s constitutional prerogatives.”  Application of <a aria-label=\"28 USC 458\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/458\">28 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §458</a> to Presidential Appointments of Federal Judges, 19 Op. OLC 350, 351–352 (1995); see Brief for United States 26–29; Tr. of Oral Arg. 78.  Indeed, the Executive Branch has long held that view.  The Office of Legal Counsel has recognized, for instance, that a federal statute generally prohibiting appointments to “&nbsp;‘any office or duty in any court’&nbsp;” of persons within certain degrees of consanguinity to the judges of such courts would, if &nbsp;applied to the President, infringe his power to appoint federal judges, thereby raising a serious constitutional question.  19 Op. OLC, at 350 (quoting <a aria-label=\"28 USC 458\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/458\">28 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §458</a>); see <em>id.</em>, at 350–352.  So it viewed such a statute as not applying to the President.  Likewise, it has narrowly construed a criminal prohibition on grassroots lobbying to avoid the constitutional issues that would otherwise arise, reasoning that the statute should not “be construed to prohibit the President or executive branch agencies from engaging in a general open dialogue with the public on the Administration’s programs and policies.”  Constraints Imposed by <a aria-label=\"18 USC 1913\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1913\">18 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §1913</a> on Lobbying Efforts, 13 Op. OLC 300, 304 (1989); see <em>id</em>., at 304–306.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Government thus broadly agrees that the President’s official acts are entitled to some degree of constitutional protection.  And with respect to the allegations in the indictment before us, the Government agrees that at least some of the alleged conduct involves official acts.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 125; cf. <em>id.</em>, at 128.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Yet the Government contends that the President should not be considered immune from prosecution for those official acts.  See Brief for United States 9.  On the Government’s view, as-applied challenges in the course of the trial suffice to protect Article II interests, and review of a district court’s decisions on such challenges should be deferred until after trial.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 69, 79–80, 154–158.  If the President is instead immune from prosecution, a district court’s denial of immunity would be appealable before trial.  See <em>Mitchell</em>, 472 U.&nbsp;S., at 524–530 (explaining that questions of immunity are reviewable before trial because the essence of immunity is the entitlement not to be subject to suit).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Government asserts that the “[r]obust safeguards” available in typical criminal proceedings alleviate the need for pretrial review.  Brief for United States 20 (boldface and &nbsp;emphasis omitted).  First, it points to the Justice Department’s “longstanding commitment to the impartial enforcement of the law,” <em>id.</em>, at 21, as well as the criminal justice system’s further protections: grand juries, a defendant’s procedural rights during trial, and the requirement that the Government prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>id.</em>, at 22.  Next, it contends that “existing principles of statutory construction and as-applied constitutional challenges” adequately address the separation of powers concerns involved in applying generally applicable criminal laws to a President.  <em>Id.</em>, at 29.  Finally, the Government cites certain defenses that would be available to the President in a particular prosecution, such as the public-authority defense or the advice of the Attorney General.  <em>Id.</em>, at 29–30; see <em>Nardone</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"302 U. S. 379\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/302/379\">302 U.&nbsp;S. 379</a>, 384 (1937); Tr. of Oral Arg. 107–108.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> These safeguards, though important, do not alleviate the need for pretrial review.  They fail to address the fact that under our system of separated powers, criminal prohibitions cannot apply to certain Presidential conduct to begin with.  As we have explained, when the President acts pursuant to his exclusive constitutional powers, Congress cannot—as a structural matter—regulate such actions, and courts cannot review them.  See Part II–A, <em>supra</em>.  And he is at least presumptively immune from prosecution for his other official actions.  See Part II–B,<em> supra</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Questions about whether the President may be held liable for particular actions, consistent with the separation of powers, must be addressed at the outset of a proceeding.  Even if the President were ultimately not found liable for certain official actions, the possibility of an extended proceeding alone may render him “unduly cautious in the discharge of his official duties.”  <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 752, n.&nbsp;32.  Vulnerability “&nbsp;‘to the burden of a trial and to the inevitable danger of its outcome, would dampen the ardor of all but the most resolute.’&nbsp;”  <em>Id.</em>, at 752–753, n.&nbsp;32 (quoting <em>Gregoire </em>v. <em>Biddle</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/177_F.2d_579\">177 F.&nbsp;2d 579</a>, 581 (CA2 1949) (Hand, L., C.&nbsp;J.)).  The Constitution does not tolerate such impediments to “the effective functioning of government.”  <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 751.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> As for the Government’s assurances that prosecutors and grand juries will not permit political or baseless prosecutions from advancing in the first place, those assurances are available to every criminal defendant and fail to account for the President’s “unique position in the constitutional scheme.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 749.  We do not ordinarily decline to decide significant constitutional questions based on the Government’s promises of good faith.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Stevens</em>, <a aria-label=\"559 U. S. 460\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/559/460\">559 U.&nbsp;S. 460</a>, 480 (2010) (“We would not uphold an unconstitutional statute merely because the Government promised to use it responsibly.”).  Nor do we do so today.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">C</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> As for the dissents, they strike a tone of chilling doom that is wholly disproportionate to what the Court actually does today—conclude that immunity extends to official discussions between the President and his Attorney General, and then remand to the lower courts to determine “in the first instance” whether and to what extent Trump’s remaining alleged conduct is entitled to immunity.  <em>Supra</em>, at 24, 28, 30.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The principal dissent’s starting premise—that unlike Speech and Debate Clause immunity, no constitutional text supports Presidential immunity, see <em>post</em>, at 4–6 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Sotomayor</span>, J.)—is one that the Court rejected decades ago as “unpersuasive.”  <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 750, n.&nbsp;31; see also <em>Nixon</em>, 418 U.&nbsp;S., at 705–706, n.&nbsp;16 (rejecting unanimously a similar argument in the analogous executive privilege context).  “[A] specific textual basis has not been considered a prerequisite to the recognition of immunity.”  <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 750, n.&nbsp;31.  Nor is that premise correct.  True, there is no “Presidential immunity clause” in &nbsp;the Constitution.  But there is no “&nbsp;‘separation of powers clause’&nbsp;” either.  <em>Seila Law</em>, 591 U.&nbsp;S., at 227.  Yet that doctrine is undoubtedly carved into the Constitution’s text by its three articles separating powers and vesting the Executive power solely in the President.  See <em>ibid.</em>  And the Court’s prior decisions, such as <em>Nixon</em> and <em>Fitzgerald</em>, have long recognized that doctrine as mandating certain Presidential privileges and immunities, even though the Constitution contains no explicit “provision for immunity.”  <em>Post</em>, at 4; see Part II–B–1, <em>supra</em>.  Neither the dissents nor the Government disavow any of those prior decisions.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 76–77.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The principal dissent then cites the Impeachment Judgment Clause, arguing that it “clearly contemplates that a former President may be subject to criminal prosecution.”  <em>Post</em>, at 6.  But that Clause does not indicate whether a former President may, consistent with the separation of powers, be prosecuted for his <em>official</em> conduct in particular.  See <em>supra</em>, at 32–33.  And the assortment of historical sources the principal dissent cites are unhelpful for the same reason.  See <em>post</em>, at 6–8. <em> </em>As the Court has previously noted, relevant historical evidence on the question of Presidential immunity is of a “fragmentary character.”  <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 752, n.&nbsp;31; see also <em>Clinton</em>, 520 U.&nbsp;S., at 696–697; cf. <em>Youngstown</em>, 343 U.&nbsp;S., at 634 (Jackson, J., concurring) (noting “the poverty of really useful and unambiguous authority applicable to concrete problems of executive power”).  “[T]he most compelling arguments,” therefore, “arise from the Constitution’s separation of powers and the Judiciary’s historic understanding of that doctrine.”  <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 752, n.&nbsp;31<em>.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Court’s prior admonition is evident in the principal dissent’s citations.  Some of its cherry-picked sources do not even discuss the President in particular.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>post</em>, at 7–8 (citing 2 Debates on the Constitution 177 (J. Elliot ed. 1836); 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the &nbsp;United States §780, pp. 250–251 (1833)).  And none of them indicate whether he may be prosecuted for his official conduct.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>post</em>, at 6, 7, n.&nbsp;2 (citing The Federalist No. 69; 4 Debates on the Constitution, at 109).  The principal dissent’s most compelling piece of evidence consists of excerpted statements of Charles Pinckney from an 1800 Senate debate.  See <em>post</em>, at 7.  But those statements reflect only the now-discredited argument that any immunity not expressly mentioned in the Constitution must not exist.  See 3 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp.&nbsp;384–385 (M. Farrand ed. 1911).  And Pinckney is not exactly a reliable authority on the separation of powers: He went on to state on the same day that “it was wrong to give the nomination of Judges to the President”—an opinion expressly rejected by the Framers.  <em>Id.</em>, at 385.  Given the Framers’ desire for an energetic and vigorous President, the principal dissent’s view that the Constitution they designed allows all his actions to be subject to prosecution—even the exercise of powers it grants exclusively to him—defies credulity.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Unable to muster any meaningful textual or historical support, the principal dissent suggests that there is an “established understanding” that “former Presidents are answerable to the criminal law for their official acts.”  <em>Post</em>, at 9.  Conspicuously absent is mention of the fact that since the founding, no President has ever faced criminal charges—let alone for his conduct in office.  And accordingly no court has ever been faced with the question of a President’s immunity from prosecution.  All that our Nation’s practice establishes on the subject is silence.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Coming up short on reasoning, the dissents repeatedly level variations of the accusation that the Court has rendered the President “above the law.”  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>post</em>, at 1, 3, 11, 12, 21, 30 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Sotomayor</span>, J.); <em>post</em>, at 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 19 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Jackson</span>, J.).  As before, that “rhetorically chilling” contention is “wholly unjustified.”  <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 758, n.&nbsp;41.  Like everyone else, the President is subject to prosecution in his unofficial capacity.  But unlike anyone else, the President is a branch of government, and the Constitution vests in him sweeping powers and duties.  Accounting for that reality—and ensuring that the President may exercise those powers forcefully, as the Framers anticipated he would—does not place him above the law; it preserves the basic structure of the Constitution from which that law derives.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The dissents’ positions in the end boil down to ignoring the Constitution’s separation of powers and the Court’s precedent and instead fear mongering on the basis of extreme hypotheticals about a future where the President “feels empowered to violate federal criminal law.”  <em>Post</em>, at 18 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Sotomayor</span>, J.); see <em>post</em>, at 26, 29–30; <em>post</em>, at 8–9, 10, 12, 16, 20–21 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Jackson</span>, J.).  The dissents overlook the more likely prospect of an Executive Branch that cannibalizes itself, with each successive President free to prosecute his predecessors, yet unable to boldly and fearlessly carry out his duties for fear that he may be next.  For instance, Section 371—which has been charged in this case—is a broadly worded criminal statute that can cover “&nbsp;‘any conspiracy for the purpose of impairing, obstructing or defeating the lawful function of any department of Government.’&nbsp;”  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Johnson</em>, <a aria-label=\"383 U. S. 169\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/383/169\">383 U.&nbsp;S. 169</a>, 172 (1966) (quoting <em>Haas</em> v. <em>Henkel</em>, <a aria-label=\"216 U. S. 462\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/216/462\">216 U.&nbsp;S. 462</a>, 479 (1910)).  Virtually every President is criticized for insufficiently enforcing some aspect of federal law (such as drug, gun, immigration, or environmental laws).  An enterprising prosecutor in a new administration may assert that a previous President violated that broad statute.  Without immunity, such types of prosecutions of ex-Presidents could quickly become routine.  The enfeebling of the Presidency and our Government that would result from such a cycle of factional strife is exactly what the Framers intended to &nbsp;avoid.  Ignoring those risks, the dissents are instead content to leave the preservation of our system of separated powers up to the good faith of prosecutors.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Finally, the principal dissent finds it “troubling” that the Court does not “designate any course of conduct alleged in the indictment as private.”  <em>Post</em>, at 27.  Despite the unprecedented nature of this case, the significant constitutional questions that it raises, its expedited treatment in the lower courts and in this Court, the lack of factual analysis in the lower courts, and the lack of briefing on how to categorize the conduct alleged, the principal dissent would go ahead and declare all of it unofficial.  The other dissent, meanwhile, analyzes the case under comprehensive models and paradigms of its own concoction and accuses the Court of providing “no meaningful guidance about how to apply [the] new paradigm or how to categorize a President’s conduct.”  <em>Post</em>, at 13 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Jackson</span>, J.).  It would have us exhaustively define every application of Presidential immunity.  See <em>post</em>, at 13–14.<em> </em>Our dissenting colleagues exude an impressive infallibility.  While their confidence may be inspiring, the Court adheres to time-tested practices instead—deciding what is required to dispose of this case and remanding after “revers[ing] on a threshold question,” <em>Zivotofsky</em>, 566 U.&nbsp;S., at 201, to obtain “guidance from the litigants [and] the court below,” <em>Vidal</em> v. <em>Elster</em>, <a aria-label=\"602 U. S. 286\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/602/286\">602 U.&nbsp;S. 286</a>, 328 (2024) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Sotomayor</span>, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">V</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> This case poses a question of lasting significance: When may a former President be prosecuted for official acts taken during his Presidency?  Our Nation has never before needed an answer.  But in addressing that question today, unlike the political branches and the public at large, we cannot afford to fixate exclusively, or even primarily, on present exigencies.  In a case like this one, focusing on “transient results” may have profound consequences for the separation &nbsp;of powers and for the future of our Republic.  <em>Youngstown</em>, 343 U.&nbsp;S., at 634 (Jackson, J., concurring).  Our perspective must be more farsighted, for “[t]he peculiar circumstances of the moment may render a measure more or less wise, but cannot render it more or less constitutional.”  Chief Justice John Marshall, A Friend of the Constitution No. V, Alexandria Gazette, July 5, 1819, in John Marshall’s Defense of <em>McCulloch v. Maryland</em> 190–191 (G. Gunther ed. 1969).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Our first President had such a perspective.  In his Farewell Address, George Washington reminded the Nation that “a Government of as much vigour as is consistent with the perfect security of Liberty is indispensable.”  35 Writings of George Washington 226 (J. Fitzpatrick ed. 1940).  A government “too feeble to withstand the enterprises of faction,” he warned, could lead to the “frightful despotism” of “alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 226–227.  And the way to avoid that cycle, he explained, was to ensure that government powers remained “properly distributed and adjusted.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 226.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> It is these enduring principles that guide our decision in this case.  The President enjoys no immunity for his unofficial acts, and not everything the President does is official.  The President is not above the law.  But Congress may not criminalize the President’s conduct in carrying out the responsibilities of the Executive Branch under the Constitution.  And the system of separated powers designed by the Framers has always demanded an energetic, independent Executive.  The President therefore may not be prosecuted for exercising his core constitutional powers, and he is entitled, at a minimum, to a presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts.  That immunity applies equally to all occupants of the Oval Office, regardless of politics, policy, or party.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the D.&nbsp;C.

But of course the prosecutor may point to the public record to show the fact that the President performed the official act.  And the prosecutor may admit evidence of what the President allegedly demanded, received, accepted, or agreed to receive or accept in return for being influenced in the performance of the act.

What the prosecutor may not do, however, is admit testimony or private records of the President or his advisers probing the official act itself.  Allowing that sort of evidence would invite the jury to inspect the President’s motivations for his official actions and to second-guess their propriety.  As we have explained, such inspection would be “highly intrusive” and would “&nbsp;‘seriously cripple’&nbsp;” the President’s exercise of his official duties.  <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 745, 756 (quoting <em>Spalding </em>v. <em>Vilas</em>, <a aria-label=\"161 U.

Fortunately, the Constitution does not permit us to chart such a dangerous course.  As the Court forcefully explains, the Framers “deemed an energetic executive essential to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the security of liberty,” and our “system of separated powers” accordingly insulates the President from prosecution for his official acts.  <em>Ante</em>, at 10, 42 (internal quotation marks omitted).  To conclude otherwise would hamstring the vigorous Executive that our Constitution envisions.  “While the separation of powers may prevent us from righting every wrong, it does so in order to ensure that we do not lose liberty.”  <em>Morrison </em>v.<em> Olson</em>, <a aria-label=\"487 U. S. 654\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/487/654\">487 U.&nbsp;S. 654</a>, 710–711 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> I write separately to highlight another way in which this prosecution may violate our constitutional structure.  In this case, the Attorney General purported to appoint a private citizen as Special Counsel to prosecute a former President on behalf of the United States.  But, I am not sure that any office for the Special Counsel has been “established by Law,” as the Constitution requires.  Art.&nbsp;II, §2, cl.&nbsp;2.  By requiring that Congress create federal offices “by Law,” the Constitution imposes an important check against the President—he cannot create offices at his pleasure.  If there is &nbsp;no law establishing the office that the Special Counsel occupies, then he cannot proceed with this prosecution.  A private citizen cannot criminally prosecute anyone, let alone a former President.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> No former President has faced criminal prosecution for his acts while in office in the more than 200 years since the founding of our country.  And, that is so despite numerous past Presidents taking actions that many would argue constitute crimes.  If this unprecedented prosecution is to proceed, it must be conducted by someone duly authorized to do so by the American people.  The lower courts should thus answer these essential questions concerning the Special Counsel’s appointment before proceeding.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">I</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The Constitution sets forth how an office may be created and how it may be filled.  The Appointments Clause provides:</p>\n<p class=\"bqonly1para jy-both\">“[The President] shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Department.”  Art.&nbsp;II, §2, cl.&nbsp;2.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The constitutional process for filling an office is plain from this text.  The default manner for appointing “Officers of the United States” is nomination by the President and confirmation by the Senate.  <em>Ibid</em>.  “But the Clause provides a limited exception for the appointment of inferior officers: Congress may ‘by Law’ authorize” one of three specified ac&nbsp;tors “to appoint inferior officers without the advice and consent of the Senate.”  <em>NLRB</em> v. <em>SW General, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"580 U. S. 288\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/580/288\">580 U.&nbsp;S. 288</a>, 312 (2017) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas, J.</span>, concurring).  As relevant here, a “Hea[d] of Department”—such as the Attorney General—is one such actor that Congress may authorize “by Law” to appoint inferior officers without senatorial confirmation.  Art.&nbsp;II, §2, cl.&nbsp;2.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Before the President or a Department Head can appoint any officer, however, the Constitution requires that the underlying office be “established by Law.”<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Thomas Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_5-1\" id=\"CONCUR_5-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a>  The Constitution itself creates some offices, most obviously that of the President and Vice President.  See §1.  Although the Constitution contemplates that there will be “other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for,” it clearly requires that those offices “shall be established by Law.”  §2, cl.&nbsp;2.  And, “established by law” refers to an office that Congress creates “by statute.”  <em>Lucia</em> v. <em>SEC</em>, <a aria-label=\"585 U.

The King could wield significant power by both creating and filling offices as he saw fit.  He was “emphatically and truly styled the fountain of honor.  He not only appoint[ed] to all offices, but [could] create offices.”  The Federalist No. 69, p.&nbsp;421 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961); see also 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 271 (T. &nbsp;Cooley ed. 1871) (“[A]s the king may create new titles, so may he create new offices”).  That ability to create offices raised many “concerns about the King’s ability to amass too much power”; the King could both create a multitude of offices and then fill them with his supporters.  J. Mascott, Who Are “Officers of the United States”? 70 Stan. L.&nbsp;Rev. 443, 492 (2018) (Mascott); see also G. Wood, The Creation of the American Republic 1776–1787, p.&nbsp;143 (1969) (describing “the power of appointment to offices” as “the most insidious and powerful weapon of eighteenth-century despotism”); T. Paine, Common Sense (1776), reprinted in The Great Works of Thomas Paine 11 (1877) (explaining that “the crown .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. derives its whole consequence merely from being the giver of places and pensions”).  In fact, one of the grievances raised by the American colonists in declaring their independence was that the King “ha[d] erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.”  Declaration of Independence ¶12.  The Founders thus drafted the Constitution with “evidently a great inferiority in the power of the President, in this particular, to that of the British king.”  The Federalist No. 69, at 421.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Founders broke from the monarchial model by giving the President the power to <em>fill</em> offices (with the Senate’s approval), but not the power to <em>create</em> offices.  They did so by “imposing the constitutional requirement that new officer positions be ‘established by Law’ rather than through a King-like custom of the head magistrate unilaterally creating new offices.”  Mascott 492–493 (footnote omitted); see also 1 Annals of Cong. 581–582 (1789) (“The powers relative to offices are partly Legislative and partly Executive.  The Legislature creates the office, defines the powers, limits its duration, and annexes a compensation”); see also <em>ibid</em>. (describing the power to “designat[e] the man to fill the office” as “of an Executive nature”).  The Constitution thus “giv[es] &nbsp;Congress broad authority to establish and organize the Executive Branch.”  <em>Seila Law LLC</em> v. <em>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</em>, <a aria-label=\"591 U. S. 197\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/591/197\">591 U.&nbsp;S. 197</a>, 266 (2020) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Kagan, J.</span>, concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  By keeping the ability to create offices out of the President’s hands, the Founders ensured that no President could unilaterally create an army of officer positions to then fill with his supporters.  Instead, our Constitution leaves it in the hands of the people’s elected representatives to determine whether new executive offices should exist.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Longstanding practice from the founding to today comports with this original understanding that Congress must create offices by law.  The First Congress, for instance, routinely and explicitly created offices by statute.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., §35, <a href=\"/rio/citation/1_Stat._92\">1 Stat. 92</a>–93 (creating the offices of Attorney General and U.&nbsp;S. Attorney for each district); see also §§1–2, <em>id</em>., at 50 (creating offices of Secretary of War and his Chief Clerk); ch. 12, §1, <em>id</em>., at 65 (creating offices within the Department of Treasury for Secretary of the Treasury, a Comptroller, Auditor, Treasurer, Register, and Assistant to the Secretary).  Still today, Congress creates the offices that the Executive Branch may fill.  For example, Congress has created several offices within the Department of Justice, including the offices of the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, Associate Attorney General, Solicitor General, and Assistant Attorneys General.  See <a aria-label=\"28 USC\" href=\"/uscode/text/28\">28</a> U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §§<a aria-label=\"28 USC 503\" href=\"/uscode/text/28/503\">503</a>–<a aria-label=\"28 USC 506\" href=\"/uscode/text/28/506\">506</a>.  For some agencies, Congress has also granted the agency head the power to “appoint such officers and employees .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as are necessary to execute the functions vested in him.”  <a aria-label=\"7 USC 610 a\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/7/610#a\">7 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §610(a)</a> (Department of Agriculture); see also, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <a aria-label=\"20 USC 3461\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/3461\">20 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §3461</a> (Department of Education); <a aria-label=\"42 USC 913\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/913\">42 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §913</a> (Department of Health and Human Services).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In the past, Congress has at times expressly created offices similar to the position now occupied by the Special Counsel.  Congress created an office for a “special counsel” &nbsp;to investigate the Teapot Dome Scandal and pursue prosecutions.  See ch. 16, <a href=\"/rio/citation/43_Stat._6\">43 Stat. 6</a>.  And, a statute provided for “the appointment of an independent counsel” that we addressed in <em>Morrison</em> v. <em>Olson</em>.  See <a aria-label=\"28 USC 592\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/592\">28 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §592</a>.  That statute lapsed, and Congress has not since reauthorized the appointment of an independent counsel.  See §599.<a aria-label=\"reference 2 of Thomas Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_5-2\" id=\"CONCUR_5-2ref\"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> We cannot ignore the importance that the Constitution places on <em>who</em> creates a federal office.  To guard against tyranny, the Founders required that a federal office be “established by Law.”  As James Madison cautioned, “[i]f there is any point in which the separation of the Legislative and Executive powers ought to be maintained with greater caution, it is that which relates to officers and offices.”  1 Annals of Cong. 581.  If Congress has not reached a consensus that a particular office should exist, the Executive lacks the power to create and fill an office of his own accord.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">II</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> It is difficult to see how the Special Counsel has an office “established by Law,” as required by the Constitution.  When the Attorney General appointed the Special Counsel, he did not identify any statute that clearly creates such an office.  See Dept. of Justice Order No. 5559–2022 (Nov. 18, 2022).  Nor did he rely on a statute granting him the authority to appoint officers as he deems fit, as the heads of some other agencies have.<a aria-label=\"reference 3 of Thomas Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_5-3\" id=\"CONCUR_5-3ref\"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></a>  See <em>supra</em>, at 5.  Instead, the Attorney General relied upon several statutes of a general nature.  See Order No. 5559–2022 (citing <a aria-label=\"28 USC\" href=\"/uscode/text/28\">28</a> U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §§<a aria-label=\"28 USC 509\" href=\"/uscode/text/28/509\">509</a>, <a aria-label=\"28 USC 510\" href=\"/uscode/text/28/510\">510</a>, <a aria-label=\"28 USC 515\" href=\"/uscode/text/28/515\">515</a>, <a aria-label=\"28 USC 533\" href=\"/uscode/text/28/533\">533</a>).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; None of the statutes cited by the Attorney General appears to create an office for the Special Counsel, and especially not with the clarity typical of past statutes used for that purpose.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <a href=\"/rio/citation/43_Stat._6\">43 Stat. 6</a> (“[T]he President is further authorized and directed to appoint .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. special counsel who shall have charge and control of the prosecution of such litigation”).  Sections 509 and 510 are generic provisions concerning the functions of the Attorney General and his ability to delegate authority to “any other officer, employee, or agency.”  Section 515 contemplates an “attorney specially appointed by the Attorney General <em>under law</em>,” thereby suggesting that such an attorney’s office must have already been created by some other law.  (Emphasis added.)  As for §533, it provides that “[t]he Attorney General may appoint <em>officials</em> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to detect and prosecute crimes against the United States.”  (Emphasis added.)  It is unclear whether an “official” is equivalent to an “officer” as used by the Constitution.  See <em>Lucia</em>, 585 U.&nbsp;S., at 254–255 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas, J.</span>) (considering the meaning of “officer”).  Regardless, this provision would be a curious place for Congress to hide the creation of an office for a Special Counsel.  It is placed in a chapter concerning the Federal Bureau of Investigation (§§531–540d), not the separate chapters concerning U.&nbsp;S. Attorneys (§§541–550) or the now-lapsed Independent Counsel (§§591–599).<a aria-label=\"reference 4 of Thomas Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_5-4\" id=\"CONCUR_5-4ref\"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> To be sure, the Court gave passing reference to the cited statutes as supporting the appointment of the Special Prosecutor in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Nixon</em>, <a aria-label=\"418 U. S. 683\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/418/683\">418 U.&nbsp;S. 683</a>, 694 (1974), but it provided no analysis of those provisions’ text.  Perhaps there is an answer for why these statutes create an office for the Special Counsel.  But, before this consequen&nbsp;tial prosecution proceeds, we should at least provide a fulsome explanation of why that is so.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Even if the Special Counsel has a valid office, questions remain as to whether the Attorney General filled that office in compliance with the Appointments Clause.  For example, it must be determined whether the Special Counsel is a principal or inferior officer.  If the former, his appointment is invalid because the Special Counsel was not nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, as principal officers must be.  Art. II, §2, cl. 2.  Even if he is an inferior officer, the Attorney General could appoint him without Presidential nomination and senatorial confirmation only if “Congress .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. by law vest[ed] the Appointment” in the Attorney General as a “Hea[d] of Department.”  <em>Ibid</em>.  So, the Special Counsel’s appointment is invalid unless a statute created the Special Counsel’s office <em>and</em> gave the Attorney General the power to fill it “by Law.”</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Whether the Special Counsel’s office was “established by Law” is not a trifling technicality.  If Congress has not reached a consensus that a particular office should exist, the Executive lacks the power to unilaterally create and then fill that office.  Given that the Special Counsel purports to wield the Executive Branch’s power to prosecute, the consequences are weighty.  Our Constitution’s separation of powers, including its separation of the powers to create and fill offices, is “the absolutely central guarantee of a just Government” and the liberty that it secures for us all.  <em>Morrison</em>, 487 U.&nbsp;S., at 697 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  There is no prosecution that can justify imperiling it.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">*  *  *</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> In this case, there has been much discussion about ensuring that a President “is not above the law.”  But, as the Court explains, the President’s immunity from prosecution for his official acts <em>is</em> the law.  The Constitution provides for &nbsp;“an energetic executive,” because such an Executive is “essential to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the security of liberty.”  <em>Ante</em>, at 10 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Respecting the protections that the Constitution provides for the Office of the Presidency secures liberty.  In that same vein, the Constitution also secures liberty by separating the powers to create and fill offices.  And, there are serious questions whether the Attorney General has violated that structure by creating an office of the Special Counsel that has not been established by law.  Those questions must be answered before this prosecution can proceed.  We must respect the Constitution’s separation of powers in all its forms, else we risk rendering its protection of liberty a parchment guarantee.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<h3 class=\"fnheader\">Notes</h3>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"CONCUR_5-1\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Thomas Concurrence at reference 1\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#CONCUR_5-1ref\">1</a> &nbsp;Although a Government official may also be a “nonofficer employe[e],” I set aside that category because it is difficult to see how an official exercising the Department of Justice’s duties to enforce the criminal law by leading a prosecution could be anything but an officer.  <em>Lucia</em> v. <em>SEC</em>, <a aria-label=\"585 U.

The remainder of the opinion is consistent with my view that the Constitution prohibits Congress from criminalizing a President’s exercise of core Article II powers and closely related conduct.  That said, I would have framed the underlying legal issues differently.  The Court describes the President’s constitutional protection from certain prosecutions as an “immunity.”  As I see it, that term is shorthand for two propositions: The President can challenge the constitutionality of a criminal statute as applied to official acts alleged in the indictment, and he can obtain interlocutory review of the trial court’s ruling.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> There appears to be substantial agreement on the first point.  Like the Court, the dissenting Justices and the Special Counsel all accept that some prosecutions of a President’s official conduct may be unconstitutional.  See <em>post</em>, at 16 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Sotomayor, J.</span>); Brief for United States 24–30.  As for interlocutory review, our precedent recognizes that resolving certain legal issues before trial is necessary to safeguard important constitutional interests—here, Executive Branch independence on matters that Article II assigns to the President’s discretion.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Properly conceived, the President’s constitutional protection from prosecution is narrow.  The Court leaves open the &nbsp;possibility that the Constitution forbids prosecuting the President for <em>any</em> official conduct, instructing the lower courts to address that question in the first instance.  See <em>ante</em>, at 14.  I would have answered it now.  Though I agree that a President cannot be held criminally liable for conduct within his “conclusive and preclusive” authority and closely related acts, <em>ante</em>, at 8–9, the Constitution does not vest every exercise of executive power in the President’s sole discretion, <em>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co.</em> v. <em>Sawyer</em>, <a aria-label=\"343 U. S. 579\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/343/579\">343 U.&nbsp;S. 579</a>, 637 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring).<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Barrett Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_6-1\" id=\"CONCUR_6-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a>  Congress has concurrent authority over many Government functions, and it may sometimes use that authority to regulate the President’s official conduct, including by criminal statute.  Article II poses no barrier to prosecution in such cases.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> I would thus assess the validity of criminal charges predicated on most official acts—<em>i.e.</em>, those falling outside of the President’s core executive power—in two steps.  The first question is whether the relevant criminal statute reaches the President’s official conduct.  Not every broadly worded statute does.  For example, §956 covers conspiracy to murder in a foreign country and does not expressly exclude the President’s decision to, say, order a hostage rescue mission abroad.  <a aria-label=\"18 USC 956 a\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/956#a\">18 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §956(a)</a>.  The underlying murder statute, however, covers only “unlawful” killings.  §1111.  The Office of Legal Counsel has interpreted that phrase to reflect a public-authority exception for official acts involving the military and law enforcement.  Memorandum from D. Barron, Acting Assistant Atty. Gen., to E. Holder, Atty. &nbsp;Gen., Re: Applicability of Federal Criminal Laws and the Constitution to Contemplated Lethal Operations Against Shaykh Anwar al-Aulaqi 12–19 (July 16, 2010); see also Brief for United States 29–30; <em>post</em>, at 16, and n.&nbsp;3 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Sotomayor</span>, J., dissenting).  I express no view about the merits of that interpretation, but it shows that the threshold question of statutory interpretation is a nontrivial step.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> If the statute covers the alleged official conduct, the prosecution may proceed only if applying it in the circumstances poses no “&nbsp;‘dange[r] of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.’&nbsp;”  <em>Ante</em>, at 14 (quoting <em>Nixon </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald</em>, <a aria-label=\"457 U. S. 731\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/457/731\">457 U.&nbsp;S. 731</a>, 754 (1982)).  On remand, the lower courts will have to apply that standard to various allegations involving the President’s official conduct.<a aria-label=\"reference 2 of Barrett Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_6-2\" id=\"CONCUR_6-2ref\"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a>  Some of those allegations raise unsettled questions about the scope of Article II power, see <em>ante</em>, at 21–28, but others do not.  For example, the indictment alleges that the President “asked the Arizona House Speaker to call the legislature into session to hold a hearing” about election fraud claims.  App. 193.  The President has no authority over state legislatures or their leadership, so it is hard to see how prose-&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp;cuting him for crimes committed when dealing with the Arizona House Speaker would unconstitutionally intrude on executive power.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This two-step analysis—considering first whether the statute applies and then whether its application to the particular facts is constitutional—is similar to the approach that the Special Counsel presses in this Court.  Brief for United States 24–30.  It is also our usual approach to considering the validity of statutes in situations raising a constitutional question.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Seila Law LLC </em>v.<em> Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</em>, <a aria-label=\"591 U. S. 197\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/591/197\">591 U.&nbsp;S. 197</a>, 213, 229 (2020).<a aria-label=\"reference 3 of Barrett Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_6-3\" id=\"CONCUR_6-3ref\"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></a>  An important difference in this context is that the President is entitled to an interlocutory appeal of the trial court’s ruling.  See <em>ante</em>, at 36.  A criminal defendant in federal court normally must wait until after trial to seek review of the trial court’s refusal to dismiss charges.  See <em>United States </em>v. <em>MacDonald</em>, <a aria-label=\"435 U. S. 850\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/435/850\">435 U.&nbsp;S. 850</a>, 853–854 (1978); see also <a aria-label=\"18 USC 3731\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3731\">18 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §3731</a>.  But where trial itself threatens certain constitutional interests, we have treated the trial court’s resolution of the issue as a “final decision” for purposes of appellate jurisdiction.  <em>MacDonald</em>, 435 U.&nbsp;S., at 854–856; see <a aria-label=\"28 USC 1291\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1291\">28 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §1291</a>; see also §1257.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; The present circumstances fall squarely within our precedent authorizing interlocutory review.  When a President moves to dismiss an indictment on Article II grounds, he “makes no challenge whatsoever to the merits of the charge against him.”<em>  Abney </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"431 U. S. 651\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/431/651\">431 U.&nbsp;S. 651</a>, 659 (1977) (allowing interlocutory appeal of rejection of double jeopardy defense).  He instead contests whether the Constitution allows Congress to criminalize the alleged conduct, a question that is “collateral to, and separable from” his guilt or innocence.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Moreover, the President’s Executive Branch authority “would be significantly undermined if appellate review” of the constitutional challenge “were postponed until after conviction and sentence.”  <em>Id</em>., at 660; see also <em>Helstoski</em> v. <em>Meanor</em>, <a aria-label=\"442 U. S. 500\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/442/500\">442 U.&nbsp;S. 500</a>, 507 (1979) (allowing interlocutory appeal of refusal to dismiss an indictment on Speech or Debate Clause grounds).  The prospect of a trial court erroneously allowing the prosecution to proceed poses a unique danger to the “independence of the Executive Branch.”  <em>Trump</em> v. <em>Vance</em>, <a aria-label=\"591 U. S. 786\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/591/786\">591 U.&nbsp;S. 786</a>, 800 (2020).  As the Court explains, the possibility that the President will be made to defend his official conduct before a jury after he leaves office could distort his decisions while in office.  <em>Ante</em>, at 13–14, 36.  These Article II concerns do not insulate the President from prosecution.  But they do justify interlocutory review of the trial court’s final decision on the President’s as-applied constitutional challenge.  See <em>Helstoski</em>, 442 U.&nbsp;S., at 507–508; <em>Abney</em>, 431 U.&nbsp;S., at 659–661; see also Reply Brief for United States in No. 23–624, p.&nbsp;5 (agreeing that the President “has a right to an interlocutory appeal from the district court’s rejection of his immunity defense”).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> I understand most of the Court’s opinion to be consistent with these views.  I do not join Part III–C, however, which holds that the Constitution limits the introduction of protected conduct as <em>evidence</em> in a criminal prosecution of a President, beyond the limits afforded by executive privilege.  See <em>ante</em>, at 30–32.  I disagree with that holding; on this &nbsp;score, I agree with the dissent.  See <em>post</em>, at 25–27 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Sotomayor, J.</span>, dissenting).  The Constitution does not require blinding juries to the circumstances surrounding conduct for which Presidents <em>can</em> be held liable.  Consider a bribery prosecution—a charge not at issue here but one that provides a useful example.  The federal bribery statute forbids any public official to seek or accept a thing of value “for or because of any official act.”  <a aria-label=\"18 USC 201 c\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/201#c\">18 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §201(c)</a>.  The Constitution, of course, does not authorize a President to seek or accept bribes, so the Government may prosecute him if he does so.  See Art.&nbsp;II, §4 (listing “Bribery” as an impeachable offense); see also Memorandum from L. Silberman, Deputy Atty. Gen., to R. Burress, Office of the President, Re: Conflict of Interest Problems Arising Out of the President’s Nomination of Nelson A. Rockefeller To Be Vice President Under the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution Amendment xxv\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxxv\">Twenty-Fifth Amendment</a> to the Constitution 5 (Aug. 28, 1974) (suggesting that the federal bribery statute applies to the President).  Yet excluding from trial any mention of the official act connected to the bribe would hamstring the prosecution.  To make sense of charges alleging a <em>quid pro quo</em>, the jury must be allowed to hear about both the <em>quid </em>and the <em>quo</em>, even if the <em>quo</em>, standing alone, could not be a basis for the President’s criminal liability.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> I appreciate the Court’s concern that allowing into evidence official acts for which the President cannot be held criminally liable may prejudice the jury.  <em>Ante</em>, at 31.  But the rules of evidence are equipped to handle that concern on a case-by-case basis.  Most importantly, a trial court can exclude evidence of the President’s protected conduct “if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. unfair prejudice” or “confusing the issues.”  <a aria-label=\"Federal Rules of Evidence rule 403\" href=\"/rules/fre/rule_403\">Fed. Rule Evid. 403</a>; see also Rule 105 (requiring the court to “restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury accordingly”).  The balance is more likely to favor admitting evidence of an official act in a bribery prosecution, for instance, than one in which the protected conduct has little &nbsp;connection to the charged offense.  And if the evidence comes in, the trial court can instruct the jury to consider it only for lawful purposes.  See <em>Richardson </em>v.<em> Marsh</em>, <a aria-label=\"481 U.

But <em>any</em> statute regulating the exercise of executive power is subject to a constitutional challenge.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Collins</em> v. <em>Yellen</em>, <a aria-label=\"594 U.

I do not understand the Court to hold that all exercises of the Take Care power fall within the core executive power.  Cf. <em>post</em>, at 24 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Sotomayor, J.</span>, dissenting).  I agree with the dissent that the Constitution does not justify such an expansive view.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"CONCUR_6-2\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Barrett Concurrence at reference 2\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#CONCUR_6-2ref\">2</a> &nbsp;This analysis is unnecessary for allegations involving the President’s private conduct because the Constitution offers no protection from prosecution of acts taken in a private capacity.  <em>Ante</em>, at 15.  Sorting private from official conduct sometimes will be difficult—but not always.  Take the President’s alleged attempt to organize alternative slates of electors.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., App. 208.  In my view, that conduct is private and therefore not entitled to protection.  See <em>post</em>, at 27–28 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Sotomayor, J.</span>, dissenting).  The Constitution vests power to appoint Presidential electors in the States.  Art.&nbsp;II, §1, cl.&nbsp;2; see also <em>Chiafalo </em>v. <em>Washington</em>, <a aria-label=\"591 U. S. 578\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/591/578\">591 U.&nbsp;S. 578</a>, 588–589 (2020).  And while Congress has a limited role in that process, see Art. II, §1, cls. 3–4, the President has none.  In short, a President has no legal authority—and thus no official capacity—to influence how the States appoint their electors.  I see no plausible argument for barring prosecution of that alleged conduct.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"CONCUR_6-3\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Barrett Concurrence at reference 3\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#CONCUR_6-3ref\">3</a> &nbsp;The Court has sometimes applied an avoidance canon when inter-&nbsp;preting a statute that would interfere with the President’s prerogatives.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Franklin </em>v.<em> Massachusetts</em>, <a aria-label=\"505 U. S. 788\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/505/788\">505 U.&nbsp;S. 788</a>, 800–801 (1992); <em>Public Citizen </em>v.<em> Dept. of Justice</em>, <a aria-label=\"491 U.

It makes a mockery of the principle, foundational to our Constitution and system of Government, that no man is above the law.  Relying on little more than its own misguided wisdom about the need for “bold and unhesitating action” by the President, <em>ante,</em> at 3, 13, the Court gives former President Trump all the immunity he asked for and more.  Because our Constitution does not shield a former President from answering for criminal and treasonous acts, I dissent.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">I</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The indictment paints a stark portrait of a President desperate to stay in power.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In the weeks leading up to January 6, 2021, then-&nbsp;President Trump allegedly “spread lies that there had been outcome-determinative fraud in the election and that he had actually won,” App. 181, Indictment ¶2, despite being “notified repeatedly” by his closest advisers “that his claims were untrue,” <em>id</em>., at 188, ¶11.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> When dozens of courts swiftly rejected these claims, Trump allegedly “pushed officials in certain states to ignore the popular vote; disenfranchise millions of voters; dismiss &nbsp;legitimate electors; and ultimately, cause the ascertainment of and voting by illegitimate electors” in his favor.  <em>Id</em>., at 185–186, ¶10(a).  It is alleged that he went so far as to threaten one state election official with criminal prosecution if the official did not “&nbsp;‘find’ 11,780 votes” Trump needed to change the election result in that state.  <em>Id</em>., at 202, ¶31(f&nbsp;).  When state officials repeatedly declined to act outside their legal authority and alter their state election processes, Trump and his co-conspirators purportedly developed a plan to disrupt and displace the legitimate election certification process by organizing fraudulent slates of electors.  See <em>id</em>., at 208–209, ¶¶53–54.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> As the date of the certification proceeding neared, Trump allegedly also sought to “use the power and authority of the Justice Department” to bolster his knowingly false claims of election fraud by initiating “sham election crime investigations” and sending official letters “falsely claim[ing] that the Justice Department had identified significant concerns that may have impacted the election outcome” while “falsely present[ing] the fraudulent electors as a valid alternative to the legitimate electors.”  <em>Id</em>., at 186–187, ¶10(c).  When the Department refused to do as he asked, Trump turned to the Vice President.  Initially, he sought to persuade the Vice President “to use his ceremonial role at the January 6 certification proceeding to fraudulently alter the election results.”  <em>Id</em>., at 187, ¶10(d).  When persuasion failed, he purportedly “attempted to use a crowd of supporters that he had gathered in Washington, D.&nbsp;C., to pressure the Vice President to fraudulently alter the election results.”  <em>Id</em>., at 221, ¶86.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Speaking to that crowd on January 6, Trump “falsely claimed that, based on fraud, the Vice President could alter the outcome of the election results.”  <em>Id</em>., at 229, ¶104(a).  When this crowd then “violently attacked the Capitol and halted the proceeding,” <em>id</em>., at 188, ¶10(e), Trump allegedly &nbsp;delayed in taking any step to rein in the chaos he had unleashed.  Instead, in a last desperate ploy to hold onto power, he allegedly “attempted to exploit the violence and chaos at the Capitol” by pressuring lawmakers to delay the certification of the election and ultimately declare him the winner.  <em>Id</em>., at 233, ¶119.  That is the backdrop against which this case comes to the Court.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">II</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The Court now confronts a question it has never had to answer in the Nation’s history: Whether a former President enjoys immunity from federal criminal prosecution.  The majority thinks he should, and so it invents an atextual, ahistorical, and unjustifiable immunity that puts the President above the law.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The majority makes three moves that, in effect, completely insulate Presidents from criminal liability.  First, the majority creates absolute immunity for the President’s exercise of “core constitutional powers.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 6.  This holding is unnecessary on the facts of the indictment, and the majority’s attempt to apply it to the facts expands the concept of core powers beyond any recognizable bounds.  In any event, it is quickly eclipsed by the second move, which is to create expansive immunity for all “official act[s].”  <em>Ante,</em> at 14.  Whether described as presumptive or absolute, under the majority’s rule, a President’s use of any official power for any purpose, even the most corrupt, is immune from prosecution.  That is just as bad as it sounds, and it is baseless.  Finally, the majority declares that evidence concerning acts for which the President is immune can play no role in any criminal prosecution against him.  See <em>ante,</em> at 30–32.  That holding, which will prevent the Government from using a President’s official acts to prove knowledge or intent in prosecuting private offenses, is nonsensical.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Argument by argument, the majority invents immunity &nbsp;through brute force.  Under scrutiny, its arguments crumble.  To start, the majority’s broad “official acts” immunity is inconsistent with text, history, and established understandings of the President’s role.  See Part III, <em>infra</em>.  Moreover, it is deeply wrong, even on its own functionalist terms.  See Part IV, <em>infra</em>.  Next, the majority’s “core” immunity is both unnecessary and misguided.  See Part V, <em>infra</em>.  Furthermore, the majority’s illogical evidentiary holding is unprecedented.  See Part VI, <em>infra</em>.  Finally, this majority’s project will have disastrous consequences for the Presidency and for our democracy.  See Part VII, <em>infra</em>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">III</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The main takeaway of today’s decision is that all of a President’s official acts, defined without regard to motive or intent, are entitled to immunity that is “at least .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <em>presumptive</em>,” and quite possibly “absolute.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 14.  Whenever the President wields the enormous power of his office, the majority says, the criminal law (at least presumptively) cannot touch him.  This official-acts immunity has “no firm grounding in constitutional text, history, or precedent.”  <em>Dobbs</em> v. <em>Jackson Women’s Health Organization</em>, <a aria-label=\"597 U. S. 215\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/597/215\">597 U.&nbsp;S. 215</a>, 280 (2022).  Indeed, those “standard grounds for constitutional decisionmaking,” <em>id</em>., at 279, all point in the opposite direction.  No matter how you look at it, the majority’s official-acts immunity is utterly indefensible.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">A</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The majority calls for a “careful assessment of the scope of Presidential power under the Constitution.” <em> Ante,</em> at 5.  For the majority, that “careful assessment” does not involve the Constitution’s text.  I would start there.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Constitution’s text contains no provision for immunity from criminal prosecution for former Presidents.  Of course, “the silence of the Constitution on this score is not &nbsp;dispositive.”  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Nixon</em>, <a aria-label=\"418 U. S. 683\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/418/683\">418 U.&nbsp;S. 683</a>, 706, n.&nbsp;16 (1974).  Insofar as the majority rails against the notion that a “&nbsp;‘specific textual basis’&nbsp;” is required, <em>ante,</em> at 37 (quoting <em>Nixon </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald</em>, <a aria-label=\"457 U. S. 731\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/457/731\">457 U.&nbsp;S. 731</a>, 750, n. 31 (1982)), it is attacking an argument that has not been made here.  The omission in the text of the Constitution is worth noting, however, for at least three reasons.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> First, the Framers clearly knew how to provide for immunity from prosecution.  They did provide a narrow immunity for legislators in the Speech or Debate Clause.  See Art. I, §6, cl. 1 (“Senators and Representatives .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place”).  They did not extend the same or similar immunity to Presidents.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Second, “some state constitutions at the time of the Framing specifically provided ‘express criminal immunities’ to sitting governors.”  Brief for Scholars of Constitutional Law as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 4 (quoting S. Prakash, Prosecuting and Punishing Our Presidents, 100 Tex. L.&nbsp;Rev. 55, 69 (2021)).  The Framers chose not to include similar language in the Constitution to immunize the President.  If the Framers “had wanted to create some constitutional privilege to shield the President .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. from criminal indictment,” they could have done so.  Memorandum from R. Rotunda to K. Starr re: Indictability of the President 18 (May 13, 1998).  They did not.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Third, insofar as the Constitution does speak to this question, it actually contemplates some form of criminal liability for former Presidents.  The majority correctly rejects Trump’s argument that a former President cannot be prosecuted unless he has been impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate for the same conduct.  See <em>ante,</em> at 32–&nbsp;34; Part IV–C, <em>infra</em>.  The majority ignores, however, that the Impeachment Judgment Clause cuts against its own position.  That Clause presumes the availability of criminal process as a backstop by establishing that an official impeached and convicted by the Senate “shall <em>nevertheless</em> be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.”  Art. I, §3, cl.&nbsp;7 (emphasis added).  That Clause clearly contemplates that a former President may be subject to criminal prosecution for the same conduct that resulted (or could have resulted) in an impeachment judgment—including conduct such as “Bribery,” Art.&nbsp;II, §4, which implicates official acts almost by definition.<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Sotomayor Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-1\" id=\"DISSENT_7-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Aware of its lack of textual support, the majority points out that this Court has “recognized Presidential immunities and privileges ‘rooted in the constitutional tradition of the separation of powers and supported by our history.’&nbsp;”  <em>Ante</em>, at 10 (quoting <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 749).  That is true, as far as it goes.  Nothing in our history, however, supports the majority’s entirely novel immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The historical evidence that exists on Presidential immunity from criminal prosecution cuts decisively against it.  For instance, Alexander Hamilton wrote that former Presidents would be “liable to prosecution and punishment in the ordinary course of law.”  The Federalist No. 69, p. 452 (J. Harv. Lib. ed. 2009).  For Hamilton, that was an important distinction between “the king of Great Britain,” who was “sacred and inviolable,” and the “President of the United States,” who “would be amenable to personal punishment &nbsp;and disgrace.”  <em>Id</em>., at 458.  In contrast to the king, the President should be subject to “personal responsibility” for his actions, “stand[ing] upon no better ground than a governor of New York, and upon worse ground than the governors of Maryland and Delaware,” whose State Constitutions gave them some immunity.  <em>Id</em>., at 452.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> At the Constitutional Convention, James Madison, who was aware that some state constitutions provided governors immunity, proposed that the Convention “conside[r&nbsp;] what privileges ought to be allowed to the Executive.”  2<em> </em>Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 503 (M. Farrand ed. 1911).  There is no record of any such discussion.  <em>Ibid.  </em>Delegate Charles Pinckney later explained that “[t]he Convention which formed the Constitution well knew” that “no subject had been more abused than privilege,” and so it “determined to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. limi[t] privilege to what was necessary, and no more.”  3 <em>id.</em>, at 385.  “No privilege .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. was intended for [the] Executive.”  <em>Ibid.</em><a aria-label=\"reference 2 of Sotomayor Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-2\" id=\"DISSENT_7-2ref\"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Other commentators around the time of the Founding observed that federal officials had no immunity from prosecution, drawing no exception for the President.  James Wilson recognized that federal officers who use their official powers to commit crimes “may be tried by their country; and if their criminality is established, the law will punish.  A grand jury may present, a petty jury may convict, and the judges will pronounce the punishment.”  2 Debates on the Constitution 177 (J. Elliot ed. 1836).  A few decades later, Justice Story evinced the same understanding.  He explained that, when &nbsp;a federal official commits a crime in office, “it is indispensable, that provision should be made, that the common tribunals of justice should be at liberty to entertain jurisdiction of the offence, for the purpose of inflicting, the common punishment applicable to unofficial offenders.”  2 Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States §780, &nbsp;pp. 250–251 (1833).  Without a criminal trial, he explained, “the grossest official offenders might escape without any substantial punishment, even for crimes, which would subject their fellow citizens to capital punishment.”  <em>Id</em>., at 251.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This historical evidence reinforces that, from the very beginning, the presumption in this Nation has always been that no man is free to flout the criminal law.  The majority fails to recognize or grapple with the lack of historical evidence for its new immunity.  With nothing on its side of the ledger, the most the majority can do is claim that the historical evidence is a wash.  See <em>ante,</em> at 38–39.  It claims that the Court previously has described the “relevant historical evidence on the question of Presidential immunity” as “&nbsp;‘fragmentary’&nbsp;” and not worthy of consideration.  <em>Ante,</em> at 38 (quoting <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 752, n. 31).  Yet the Court has described only the evidence regarding “the President’s immunity <em>from damages liability</em>” as “fragmentary.”  <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 751–752, n. 31 (emphasis added).  Moreover, far from dismissing that evidence as irrelevant, the <em>Fitzgerald</em> Court was careful to note that “[t]he best historical evidence clearly support[ed]” the immunity from damages liability that it recognized, and it relied in part on that historical evidence to overcome the lack of any textual basis for its immunity.  <em>Id</em>., at 152, n. 31.  The majority ignores this reliance.  It seems history matters to this Court only when it is convenient.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Assn., Inc.</em> v. <em>Bruen</em>, <a aria-label=\"597 U.S. 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/597/1\">597 U.&nbsp;S. 1 (2022)</a>; <em>Dobbs</em>, <a aria-label=\"597 U. S. 215\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/597/215\">597 U.&nbsp;S. 215</a>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">&nbsp;C</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Our country’s history also points to an established understanding, shared by both Presidents and the Justice Department, that former Presidents are answerable to the criminal law for their official acts.  Cf. <em>Chiafalo</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a aria-label=\"591 U. S. 578\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/591/578\">591 U.&nbsp;S. 578</a>, 592–593 (2020) (“&nbsp;‘Long settled and established practice’ may have ‘great weight in a proper interpretation of constitutional provisions’&nbsp;” (quoting <em>The Pocket Veto Case</em>, <a aria-label=\"279 U. S. 655\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/279/655\">279 U.&nbsp;S. 655</a>, 689 (1929))).  Consider Watergate, for example.  After the Watergate tapes revealed President Nixon’s misuse of official power to obstruct the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s investigation of the Watergate burglary, President Ford pardoned Nixon.  Both Ford’s pardon and Nixon’s acceptance of the pardon necessarily “rested on the understanding that the former President faced potential criminal liability.”  Brief for United States 15; see also Public Papers of the Presidents, Gerald R. Ford, Vol. 1, Sept. 8, 1974, p. 103 (1975) (granting former President Nixon a “full, free, and absolute pardon .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for all offenses against the United States which he .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. has committed or may have committed or taken part in during” his Presidency); R. Nixon, Statement by Former President Richard Nixon to P. Buchen, Counsel to President Ford, &nbsp;p. 1 (Sept. 8, 1974) (accepting “full and absolute pardon for any charges which might be brought against me for actions taken during the time I was President of the United States”).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Subsequent special counsel and independent counsel investigations have also operated on the assumption that the Government can criminally prosecute former Presidents for their official acts, where they violate the criminal law.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., 1 L. Walsh, Final Report of the Independent Counsel for Iran/Contra Matters: Investigations and Prosecutions 445 (1993) (“[B]ecause a President, and certainly a past President, is subject to prosecution .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the conduct of Pres&nbsp;ident Reagan in the Iran/contra matter was reviewed by Independent Counsel against the applicable statutes.  It was concluded that [his] conduct fell well short of criminality which could be successfully prosecuted”).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Indeed, Trump’s own lawyers during his second impeachment trial assured Senators that declining to impeach Trump for his conduct related to January 6 would not leave him “in any way above the law.”  2 Proceedings of the U.&nbsp;S. Senate in the Impeachment Trial of Donald John Trump, S. Doc. 117–2, p. 144 (2021).  They insisted that a former President “is like any other citizen and can be tried in a court of law.”  <em>Ibid.</em>; see also 1 <em>id</em>., S. Doc. 117–3, at 339 (Trump’s impeachment counsel stating that “no former officeholder is immune” from the judicial process “for investigation, prosecution, and punishment”); <em>id</em>., at 322–323 (Trump’s impeachment counsel stating: “If my colleagues on this side of the Chamber actually think that President Trump committed a criminal offense .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [a]fter he is out of office, you go and arrest him”).  Now that Trump is facing criminal charges for those acts, though, the tune has changed.  Being treated “like any other citizen” no longer seems so appealing.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In sum, the majority today endorses an expansive vision of Presidential immunity that was never recognized by the Founders, any sitting President, the Executive Branch, or even President Trump’s lawyers, until now.  Settled understandings of the Constitution are of little use to the majority in this case, and so it ignores them.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">IV</h3>\n<h4 class=\"jy-center\">A</h4>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Setting aside this evidence, the majority announces that former Presidents are “absolute[ly],” or “at least .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. presumptive[ly],” immune from criminal prosecution for all of their official acts.  <em>Ante,</em> at 14 (emphasis omitted).  The majority purports to keep us in suspense as to whether this &nbsp;immunity is absolute or presumptive, but it quickly gives up the game.  It explains that, “[a]t a minimum, the President must .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. be immune from prosecution for an official act unless the Government can show that applying a criminal prohibition to that act would pose <em>no ‘dangers of intrusion </em>on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.’&nbsp;”  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  No dangers, none at all.  It is hard to imagine a criminal prosecution for a President’s official acts that would pose no dangers of intrusion on Presidential authority in the majority’s eyes.  Nor should that be the standard.  Surely some intrusions on the Executive may be “justified by an overriding need to promote objectives within the constitutional authority of Congress.”  <em>Nixon </em>v. <em>Administrator of General Services</em>, <a aria-label=\"433 U. S. 425\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/433/425\">433 U.&nbsp;S. 425</a>, 443 (1977).  Other intrusions may be justified by the “primary constitutional duty of the Judicial Branch to do justice in criminal prosecutions.”  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Nixon</em>, <a aria-label=\"418 U. S. 683\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/418/683\">418 U.&nbsp;S. 683</a>, 707 (1974).  According to the majority, however, any incursion on Executive power is too much.  When presumptive immunity is this conclusive, the majority’s indecision as to “whether [official-acts] immunity must be absolute” or whether, instead, “presumptive immunity is sufficient,” <em>ante,</em> at 6, hardly matters.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Maybe some future opinion of this Court will decide that presumptive immunity is “sufficient,” <em>ibid.</em>, and replace the majority’s ironclad presumption with one that makes the difference between presumptive and absolute immunity meaningful.  Today’s Court, however, has replaced a presumption of equality before the law with a presumption that the President is above the law for all of his official acts.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Quick on the heels of announcing this astonishingly broad official-acts immunity, the majority assures us that a former President can still be prosecuted for “unofficial acts.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 15.  Of course he can.  No one has questioned the ability to prosecute a former President for unofficial (other&nbsp;wise known as private) acts.  Even Trump did not claim immunity for such acts and, as the majority acknowledges, such an immunity would be impossible to square with <em>Clinton</em> v. <em>Jones</em>, <a aria-label=\"520 U.S. 681\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/520/681\">520 U.&nbsp;S. 681 (1997)</a>.  See <em>ante</em>, at 15.  This unremarkable proposition is no real limit on today’s decision.  It does not hide the majority’s embrace of the most far-reaching view of Presidential immunity on offer.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In fact, the majority’s dividing line between “official” and “unofficial” conduct narrows the conduct considered “unofficial” almost to a nullity.  It says that whenever the President acts in a way that is “&nbsp;‘not manifestly or palpably beyond [his] authority,’&nbsp;” he is taking official action.  <em>Ante,</em> at 17 (quoting <em>Blassingame</em> v. <em>Trump</em>, 87 F. 4th 1, 13 (CADC 2023)).  It then goes a step further: “In dividing official from unofficial conduct, courts may not inquire into the President’s motives.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 18.  It is one thing to say that motive is irrelevant to questions regarding the scope of civil liability, but it is quite another to make it irrelevant to questions regarding criminal liability.  Under that rule, any use of official power for any purpose, even the most corrupt purpose indicated by objective evidence of the most corrupt motives and intent, remains official and immune.  Under the majority’s test, if it can be called a test, the category of Presidential action that can be deemed “unofficial” is destined to be vanishingly small.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Ultimately, the majority pays lip service to the idea that “[t]he President, charged with enforcing federal criminal laws, is not above them,” <em>ante,</em> at 13–14, but it then proceeds to place former Presidents beyond the reach of the federal criminal laws for any abuse of official power.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> So how does the majority get to its rule?  With text, history, and established understanding all weighing against it, the majority claims just one arrow in its quiver: the balancing test in <em>Nixon </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald</em>, <a aria-label=\"457 U.S. 731\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/457/731\">457 U.&nbsp;S. 731 (1983)</a>.  Yet &nbsp;even that test cuts against it.  The majority concludes that official-acts immunity “is required to safeguard the independence and effective functioning of the Executive Branch,” <em>ante,</em> at 14, by rejecting that Branch’s own protestations that such immunity is not at all required and would in fact be harmful, see Brief for United States 18–24, 29–30.  In doing so, it decontextualizes <em>Fitzgerald</em>’s language, ignores important qualifications, and reaches a result that the <em>Fitzgerald</em> Court never would have countenanced.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In <em>Fitzgerald</em>, plaintiff A. Ernest Fitzgerald sued then-former President Nixon for money damages.  He claimed that, while in office, Nixon had been involved in unlawfully firing him from his government job.  See 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 733–741.  The question for the Court was whether a former President had immunity from such a civil suit.  The Court explained that it was “settled law that the separation-of-&nbsp;powers doctrine does not bar every exercise of jurisdiction over the President of the United States.”  <em>Id</em>., at 753–754.  To determine whether a particular type of suit against a President (or former President) could be heard, a court “must balance the constitutional weight of the interest to be served against the dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.”  <em>Id</em>., at 754.  The Court explained that, “[w]hen judicial action is needed to serve broad public interests—as when the Court acts, not in derogation of the separation of powers, but to maintain their proper balance, or to vindicate the public interest in an ongoing criminal prosecution—the exercise of jurisdiction has been held warranted.”  <em>Ibid.</em> (citations omitted).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> On the facts before it, the Court concluded that a “merely private suit for damages based on a President’s official acts” did not serve those interests.  <em>Ibid.  </em>The Court reasoned that the “visibility of [the President’s] office and the effect of his actions on countless people” made him an easy target for civil suits that “frequently could distract [him] from his &nbsp;public duties.”  <em>Id</em>., at 753.  The public interest in such private civil suits, the Court concluded, was comparatively weak.  See <em>id</em>., at 754, n. 37 (“[T]here is a lesser public interest in actions for civil damages than, for example, in criminal prosecutions”).  Therefore, the Court held that a former President was immune from such suits.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In the context of a federal criminal prosecution of a former President, however, the danger to the functioning of the Executive Branch is much reduced.  Further, as every member of the <em>Fitzgerald</em> Court acknowledged, see Part IV–B–2, <em>infra</em>, the public interest in a criminal prosecution is far weightier.  Applying the <em>Fitzgerald</em> balancing here should yield the opposite result.  Instead, the majority elides any difference between civil and criminal immunity, granting Trump the same immunity from criminal prosecution that Nixon enjoyed from an unlawful termination suit.  That is plainly wrong.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">1</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The majority relies almost entirely on its view of the danger of intrusion on the Executive Branch, to the exclusion of the other side of the balancing test.  Its analysis rests on a questionable conception of the President as incapable of navigating the difficult decisions his job requires while staying within the bounds of the law.  It also ignores the fact that he receives robust legal advice on the lawfulness of his actions.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The majority says that the danger “of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch” posed by criminally prosecuting a former President for official conduct “is akin to, indeed greater than, what led us to recognize absolute Presidential immunity from civil damages liability—that the President would be chilled from taking the ‘bold and unhesitating action’ required of an independent Executive.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 13 (quoting <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 745).  It is of course important that the President be able to &nbsp;“&nbsp;‘&nbsp;“deal fearlessly and impartially with” the duties of his office.’&nbsp;”  <em>Ante,</em> at 10 (quoting <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 752).  If every action the President takes exposes him personally to vexatious private litigation, the possibility of hamstringing Presidential decisionmaking is very real.  Yet there are many facets of criminal liability, which the majority discounts, that make it less likely to chill Presidential action than the threat of civil litigation.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> First, in terms of probability, the threat of criminal liability is much smaller.  In <em>Fitzgerald</em>, the threat of vexatious civil litigation loomed large.  The Court observed that, given the “visibility of his office and the effect of his actions on countless people, the President would be an easily identifiable target for suits for civil damages.”  <em>Id</em>., at 753.  Although “&nbsp;‘the effect of [the President’s] actions on countless people’ could result in untold numbers of private plaintiffs suing for damages based on any number of Presidential acts” in the civil context, the risk in the criminal context is “only that a former President may face one federal prosecution, in one jurisdiction, for each criminal offense allegedly committed while in office.”  2023 WL 8359833, *9 (DC, Dec. 1, 2023) (quoting <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 753).  The majority’s bare assertion that the burden of exposure to federal criminal prosecution is more limiting to a President than the burden of exposure to civil suits does not make it true, and it is not persuasive.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Second, federal criminal prosecutions require “robust procedural safeguards” not found in civil suits.  2023 WL 8359833, *10.  The criminal justice system has layers of protections that “filter out insubstantial legal claims,” whereas civil litigation lacks “analogous checks.”  <em>Cheney</em> v. <em>United States Dist. Court for D. C.</em>, <a aria-label=\"542 U. S. 367\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/542/367\">542 U.&nbsp;S. 367</a>, 386 (2004).  To start, Justice Department policy requires scrupulous and impartial prosecution, founded on both the facts and the law.  See generally Dept. of Justice, Justice<em> </em>Manual §9–27.000 (Principles of Federal Prosecution) (June 2023).  The &nbsp;grand jury provides an additional check on felony prosecutions, acting as a “buffer or referee between the Government and the people,” to ensure that the charges are well-founded.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Williams</em>, <a aria-label=\"504 U. S. 36\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/504/36\">504 U.&nbsp;S. 36</a>, 47 (1992); see also <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald</em>, <a aria-label=\"457 U. S. 800\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/457/800\">457 U.&nbsp;S. 800</a>, 826, n.&nbsp;6 (1982) (Burger, C.&nbsp;J., dissenting) (“[A] criminal prosecution cannot be commenced absent careful consideration by a grand jury at the request of a prosecutor; the same check is not present with respect to the commencement of civil suits in which advocates are subject to no realistic accountability”).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> If the prosecution makes it past the grand jury, then the former President still has all the protections our system provides to criminal defendants.  If the former President has an argument that a particular statute is unconstitutional as applied to him, then he can move to dismiss the charges on that ground.  Indeed, a former President is likely to have legal arguments that would be unavailable to the average criminal defendant.  For example, he may be able to rely on a public-authority exception from particular criminal laws,<a aria-label=\"reference 3 of Sotomayor Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-3\" id=\"DISSENT_7-3ref\"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></a> or an advice-of-the-Attorney-General defense, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 107–108.<a aria-label=\"reference 4 of Sotomayor Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-4\" id=\"DISSENT_7-4ref\"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; If the case nonetheless makes it to trial, the Government will bear the burden of proving every element of the alleged crime beyond a reasonable doubt to a unanimous jury of the former President’s fellow citizens.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Gaudin</em>, <a aria-label=\"515 U. S. 506\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/515/506\">515 U.&nbsp;S. 506</a>, 510 (1995).  If the Government manages to overcome even that significant hurdle, then the former President can appeal his conviction, and the appellate review of his claims will be “&nbsp;‘particularly meticulous.’&nbsp;”  <em>Trump</em> v. <em>Vance</em>, <a aria-label=\"591 U. S. 786\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/591/786\">591 U.&nbsp;S. 786</a>, 809 (2020) (quoting <em>Nixon</em>, 418 U.&nbsp;S., at 702).  He can ultimately seek this Court’s review, and if past practice (including in this case) is any indication, he will receive it.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In light of these considerable protections, the majority’s fear that “&nbsp;‘bare allegations of malice,’&nbsp;” <em>ante,</em> at 18 (alteration omitted), would expose former Presidents to trial and conviction is unfounded.  Bare allegations of malice would not make it out of the starting gate.  Although a private civil action may be brought based on little more than “&nbsp;‘intense feelings,’&nbsp;” <em>ante,</em> at 11 (quoting <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 752), a federal criminal prosecution is made of firmer stuff.  Certainly there has been, on occasion, great feelings of animosity between incoming and outgoing Presidents over the course of our country’s history.  Yet it took allegations as grave as those at the center of this case to have the first federal criminal prosecution of a former President.  That restraint is telling.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Third, because of longstanding interpretations by the Executive Branch, every sitting President has so far believed himself under the threat of criminal liability after his term in office and nevertheless boldly fulfilled the duties of his office.  The majority insists that the threat of criminal sanctions is “more likely to distort Presidential decisionmaking than the potential payment of civil damages.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 13.  If that is right, then that distortion has been shaping Presidential decisionmaking since the earliest days of the Republic.  Although it makes sense to avoid “diversion of the &nbsp;President’s attention during the decisionmaking process” with “needless worry,” <em>Clinton</em>, 520 U.&nbsp;S., at 694, n.&nbsp;19, one wonders why requiring some small amount of his attention (or his legal advisers’ attention) to go towards complying with federal criminal law is such a great burden.  If the President follows the law that he must “take Care” to execute, Art.&nbsp;II, §3, he has not been rendered “&nbsp;‘unduly cautious,’&nbsp;” <em>ante,</em> at 10 (quoting <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 752, &nbsp;n. 32).  Some amount of caution is necessary, after all.  It is a far greater danger if the President feels empowered to violate federal criminal law, buoyed by the knowledge of future immunity.  I am deeply troubled by the idea, inherent in the majority’s opinion, that our Nation loses something valuable when the President is forced to operate within the confines of federal criminal law.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> So what exactly is the majority worried about deterring when it expresses great concern for the “deterrent” effect that “the threat of trial, judgment, and imprisonment” would pose?  <em>Ante,</em> at 13.  It cannot possibly be the deterrence of acts that are truly criminal.  Nor does it make sense for the majority to wring its hands over the possibility that Presidents might stop and think carefully before taking action that borders on criminal.  Instead, the majority’s main concern could be that Presidents will be deterred from taking necessary and lawful action by the fear that their successors might pin them with a baseless criminal prosecution—a prosecution that would almost certainly be doomed to fail, if it even made it out of the starting gate.  See <em>ante,</em> at 40.  The Court should not have so little faith in this Nation’s Presidents.  As this Court has said before in the context of criminal proceedings, “&nbsp;‘[t]he chance that now and then there may be found some timid soul who will take counsel of his fears and give way to their repressive power is too remote and shadowy to shape the course of justice.’&nbsp;”  <em>Nixon</em>, 418 U.&nbsp;S., at 712, n.&nbsp;20 (quoting <em>Clark</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"289 U. S. 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/289/1\">289 U.&nbsp;S. 1</a>, 16 (1933)).  The concern that countless &nbsp;(and baseless) civil suits would hamper the Executive may have been justified in <em>Fitzgerald</em>, but a well-founded federal criminal prosecution poses no comparable danger to the functioning of the Executive Branch.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">2</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> At the same time, the public interest in a federal criminal prosecution of a former President is vastly greater than the public interest in a private individual’s civil suit.  All nine Justices in <em>Fitzgerald</em> explicitly recognized that distinction.  The five-Justice majority noted that there was a greater public interest “in criminal prosecutions” than in “actions for civil damages.”  457 U.&nbsp;S., at 754, n. 37.  Chief Justice Burger’s concurrence accordingly emphasized that the majority’s immunity was “limited to civil damages claims,” rather than “<em>criminal </em>prosecution.”  <em>Id</em>., at 759–760.  The four dissenting Justices agreed that a “contention that the President is immune from criminal prosecution in the courts,” if ever made, would not “be credible.”  <em>Id</em>., at 780 (White, J., dissenting).  At the very least, the <em>Fitzgerald</em> Court did not expect that its balancing test would lead to the same outcome in the criminal context.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The public’s interest in prosecution is transparent: a federal prosecutor herself acts on behalf of the United States.  Even the majority acknowledges that the “[f]ederal criminal laws seek to redress ‘a wrong to the public’ as a whole, not just ‘a wrong to the individual,’&nbsp;” <em>ante,</em> at 13 (quoting <em>Huntington</em> v. <em>Attrill</em>, <a aria-label=\"146 U. S. 657\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/146/657\">146 U.&nbsp;S. 657</a>, 668 (1892)), such that there is “a compelling ‘public interest in fair and effective law enforcement,’&nbsp;” <em>ante,</em> at 13 (quoting <em>Vance</em>, 591 U.&nbsp;S., at 808).  Indeed, “our historic commitment to the rule of law” is “nowhere more profoundly manifest than in our view that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ‘guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer.’&nbsp;” <em>Nixon</em>, 418 U.&nbsp;S., at 708–709 (quoting <em>Berger</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"295 U. S. 78\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/295/78\">295 U.&nbsp;S. 78</a>, 88 (1935)).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The public interest in criminal prosecution is particularly &nbsp;strong with regard to officials who are granted some degree of civil immunity because of their duties.  It is in those cases where the public can see that officials exercising power under public trust remain on equal footing with their fellow citizens under the criminal law.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>O’Shea</em> v. <em>Littleton</em>, <a aria-label=\"414 U. S. 488\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/414/488\">414 U.&nbsp;S. 488</a>, 503 (1974) (“[W]e have never held that the performance of the duties of judicial, legislative, or executive officers, requires or contemplates the immunization of otherwise criminal deprivations of constitutional rights”); <em>Dennis</em> v. <em>Sparks</em>, <a aria-label=\"449 U. S. 24\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/449/24\">449 U.&nbsp;S. 24</a>, 31 (1980) (“[J]udicial immunity was not designed to insulate the judiciary from all aspects of public accountability.  Judges are immune from §1983 damages actions, but they are subject to criminal prosecutions as are other citizens”); <em>Imbler</em> v. <em>Pachtman</em>, <a aria-label=\"424 U. S. 409\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/424/409\">424 U.&nbsp;S. 409</a>, 428–429 (1976) (“We emphasize that the [civil] immunity of prosecutors .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. does not leave the public powerless to deter misconduct or to punish that which occurs.  This Court has never suggested that the policy considerations which compel civil immunity for certain governmental officials also place them beyond the reach of the criminal law.  Even judges, cloaked with absolute civil immunity for centuries, could be punished criminally”).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The public interest in the federal criminal prosecution of a former President alleged to have used the powers of his office to commit crimes may be greater still.  “[T]he President .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. represent[s] all the voters in the Nation,” and his powers are given by the people under our Constitution.  <em>Anderson</em> v. <em>Celebrezze</em>, <a aria-label=\"460 U. S. 780\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/460/780\">460 U.&nbsp;S. 780</a>, 795 (1983).  When Presidents use the powers of their office for personal gain or as part of a criminal scheme, every person in the country has an interest in that criminal prosecution.  The majority overlooks that paramount interest entirely.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Finally, the question of federal criminal immunity for a former President “involves a countervailing Article II consideration absent in <em>Fitzgerald</em>”: recognizing such an im&nbsp;munity “would frustrate the Executive Branch’s enforcement of the criminal law.”  Brief for United States 19.  The President is, of course, entrusted with “&nbsp;‘supervisory and policy responsibilities of utmost discretion and sensitivity.’&nbsp;”  <em>Ante</em> at 10 (quoting <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 750).  One of the most important is “enforcement of federal law,” as “it is the President who is charged constitutionally to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.’&nbsp;” <em>Id.</em>, at 750 (quoting Art.&nbsp;II, §3).  The majority seems to think that allowing former Presidents to escape accountability for breaking the law while disabling the current Executive from prosecuting such violations somehow respects the independence of the Executive.  It does not.  Rather, it diminishes that independence, exalting occupants of the office over the office itself.  There is a twisted irony in saying, as the majority does, that the person charged with “tak[ing] Care that the Laws be faithfully executed” can break them with impunity.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In the case before us, the public interest and countervailing Article II interest are particularly stark.  The public interest in this criminal prosecution implicates both “[t]he Executive Branch’s interest in upholding Presidential elections and vesting power in a new President under the Constitution” as well as “the voters’ interest in democratically selecting their President.”  91 F. 4th 1173, 1195 (CADC 2024) (<em>per&nbsp;curiam</em>).  It also, of course, implicates Congress’s own interest in regulating conduct through the criminal law.  Cf. <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 749, n. 27 (noting that the case did not involve “affirmative action by Congress”).  Yet the majority believes that a President’s anxiety over prosecution overrides the public’s interest in accountability and negates the interests of the other branches in carrying out their constitutionally assigned functions.  It is, in fact, the majority’s position that “boil[s] down to ignoring the Constitution’s separation of powers.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 40.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">&nbsp;C</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Finally, in an attempt to put some distance between its official-acts immunity and Trump’s requested immunity, the majority insists that “Trump asserts a far broader immunity than the limited one [the majority has] recognized.”  <em>Ante</em>, at 32.  If anything, the opposite is true.  The only part of Trump’s immunity argument that the majority rejects is the idea that “the Impeachment Judgment Clause requires that impeachment and Senate conviction precede a President’s criminal prosecution.”  <em>Ibid.  </em>That argument is obviously wrong.  See <em>ante</em>, at 32–34.  Rejecting it, however, does not make the majority’s immunity narrower than Trump’s.  Inherent in Trump’s Impeachment Judgment Clause argument is the idea that a former President who was impeached in the House and convicted in the Senate for crimes involving his official acts could then be prosecuted in court for those acts.  See Brief for Petitioner 22 (“The Founders thus adopted a carefully balanced approach that permits the criminal prosecution of a former President for his official acts, but only if that President is first impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate”).  By extinguishing that path to overcoming immunity, however nonsensical it might be, the majority arrives at an official-acts immunity even more expansive than the one Trump argued for.  On the majority’s view (but not Trump’s), a former President whose abuse of power was so egregious and so offensive even to members of his own party that he was impeached in the House and convicted in the Senate still would be entitled to “at least presumptive” criminal immunity for those acts.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">V</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Separate from its official-acts immunity, the majority recognizes absolute immunity for “conduct within [the President’s] exclusive sphere of constitutional authority.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 9.  Feel free to skip over those pages of the majority’s &nbsp;opinion.  With broad official-acts immunity covering the field, this ostensibly narrower immunity serves little purpose.  In any event, this case simply does not turn on conduct within the President’s “exclusive sphere of constitutional authority,” and the majority’s attempt to apply a core immunity of its own making expands the concept of “core constitutional powers,” <em>ante,</em> at 6, beyond any recognizable bounds.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The idea of a narrow core immunity might have some intuitive appeal, in a case that actually presented the issue.  If the President’s power is “conclusive and preclusive” on a given subject, then Congress should not be able to “ac[t&nbsp;] upon the subject.”  <em>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co.</em> v. <em>Sawyer</em>, <a aria-label=\"343 U. S. 579\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/343/579\">343 U.&nbsp;S. 579</a>, 638 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring).  In his <em>Youngstown</em> concurrence, Justice Robert Jackson posited that the President’s “power of removal in executive agencies” seemed to fall within this narrow category.  <em>Ibid</em>., n. 4.  Other decisions of this Court indicate that the pardon power also falls in this category, see <em>United States</em> v. <em>Klein</em>, 13 Wall. 128, 147 (1872) (“To the executive alone is intrusted the power of pardon; and it is granted without limit”), as does the power to recognize foreign countries, see <em>Zivotofsky</em> v. <em>Kerry</em>, <a aria-label=\"576 U. S. 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/576/1\">576 U.&nbsp;S. 1</a>, 32 (2015) (holding that the President has “exclusive power .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to control recognition determinations”).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In this case, however, the question whether a former President enjoys a narrow immunity for the “exercise of his core constitutional powers,” <em>ante,</em> at 6, has never been at issue, and for good reason: Trump was not criminally indicted for taking actions that the Constitution places in the unassailable core of Executive power.  He was not charged, for example, with illegally wielding the Presidency’s pardon power or veto power or appointment power or even removal power.  Instead, Trump was charged with a conspiracy to commit fraud to subvert the Presidential election.  It is true that the detailed indictment in this case alleges that Trump &nbsp;threatened to remove an Acting Attorney General who would not carry out his scheme.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., App. 216–217, Indictment ¶¶74, 77.  Yet it is equally clear that the Government does not seek to “impose criminal liability on the [P]resident for exercising or talking about exercising the appointment and removal power.”  Tr. of Oral Arg. 127.  If that were the majority’s concern, it could simply have said that the Government cannot charge a President’s threatened use of the removal power as an overt act in the conspiracy.  It says much more.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The core immunity that the majority creates will insulate a considerably larger sphere of conduct than the narrow core of “conclusive and preclusive” powers that the Court previously has recognized.  The first indication comes when the majority includes the President’s broad duty to “&nbsp;‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed’&nbsp;” among the core functions for which a former President supposedly enjoys absolute immunity.  <em>Ante,</em> at 20  (quoting Art.&nbsp;II, §3).  That expansive view of core power will effectively insulate all sorts of noncore conduct from criminal prosecution.  Were there any question, consider how the majority applies its newly minted core immunity to the allegations in this case.  It concludes that “Trump is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. absolutely immune from prosecution for” any “conduct involving his discussions with Justice Department officials.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 21.  That conception of core immunity expands the “conclusive and preclusive” category beyond recognition, foreclosing the possibility of prosecution for broad swaths of conduct.  Under that view of core powers, even fabricating evidence and insisting the Department use it in a criminal case could be covered.  The majority’s conception of “core” immunity sweeps far more broadly than its logic, borrowed from <em>Youngstown</em>, should allow.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The majority tries to assuage any concerns about its made-up core immunity by suggesting that the Government &nbsp;agrees with it.  See <em>ante,</em> at 34.  That suggestion will surprise the Government.  To say, as the Government did, that a “small core of exclusive official acts” such as “the pardon power, the power to recognize foreign nations, the power to veto legislation, [and] the power to make appointments” cannot be regulated by Congress, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 85–87, does not suggest that the Government agrees with immunizing any and all conduct conceivably related to the majority’s broad array of supposedly “core” powers.  The Government in fact advised this Court to “leav[e] potentially more difficult questions” about the scope of any immunity “that might arise on different facts for decision if they are ever presented.”  Brief for United States 45.  That would have made sense.  The indictment here does not pose any threat of impermissibly criminalizing acts within the President’s “conclusive and preclusive” authority.  Perhaps for this reason, even Trump discouraged consideration of “a narrower scope of immunity,” claiming that such an immunity “would be nearly impossible to fashion, and would certainly involve impractical line-drawing problems in every application.”  Brief for Petitioner 43–44.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> When forced to wade into thorny separation-of-powers disputes, this Court’s usual practice is to “confine the opinion only to the very questions necessary to decision of the case.”  <em>Dames &amp; Moore</em> v. <em>Regan</em>, <a aria-label=\"453 U. S. 654\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/453/654\">453 U.&nbsp;S. 654</a>, 661 (1981).  There is plenty of peril and little value in crafting a core immunity doctrine that Trump did not seek and that rightly has no application to this case.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">VI</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Not content simply to invent an expansive criminal immunity for former Presidents, the majority goes a dramatic and unprecedented step further.  It says that acts for which the President is immune must be redacted from the narrative of even wholly private crimes committed while in office.  They must play no role in proceedings regarding private &nbsp;criminal acts.  See <em>ante,</em> at 30–32.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Even though the majority’s immunity analysis purports to leave unofficial acts open to prosecution, its draconian approach to official-acts evidence deprives these prosecutions of any teeth.  If the former President cannot be held criminally liable for his official acts, those acts should still be admissible to prove knowledge or intent in criminal prosecutions of unofficial acts.  For instance, the majority struggles with classifying whether a President’s speech is in his capacity as President (official act) or as a candidate (unofficial act).  Imagine a President states in an official speech that he intends to stop a political rival from passing legislation that he opposes, no matter what it takes to do so (official act).  He then hires a private hitman to murder that political rival (unofficial act).  Under the majority’s rule, the murder indictment could include no allegation of the President’s public admission of premeditated intent to support the <em>mens rea</em> of murder.  That is a strange result, to say the least.<a aria-label=\"reference 5 of Sotomayor Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-5\" id=\"DISSENT_7-5ref\"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The majority’s extraordinary rule has no basis in law.  Consider the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> context.  Although the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> prohibits criminalizing most speech, it “does not prohibit the evidentiary use of speech,” including its use “to prove motive or intent.”  <em>Wisconsin</em> v. <em>Mitchell</em>, <a aria-label=\"508 U. S. 476\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/508/476\">508 U.&nbsp;S. 476</a>, 489 (1993).  Evidentiary rulings and limiting instructions can ensure that evidence concerning official acts is “considered only for the proper purpose for which it was admitted.”  <em>Huddleston</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"485 U. S. 681\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/485/681\">485 U.&nbsp;S. 681</a>, 691–692 (1988).  The majority has no coherent explanation as to &nbsp;why these protections that are sufficient in every other context would be insufficient here.  It simply asserts that it would be “untenable” and would deprive immunity of its “&nbsp;‘intended effect.’&nbsp;”  <em>Ante,</em> at 31 (quoting <em>Fitzgerald</em>, 457 U.&nbsp;S., at 756).  The majority hazards an explanation that the use of official-acts evidence will “raise a unique risk that the jurors’ deliberations will be prejudiced by their views of the President’s policies and performance while in office.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 31.  That “unique risk,” however, is not a product of introducing official-acts evidence.  It is simply the risk involved in any suit against a former President, including the private-acts prosecutions the majority says it would allow.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">VII</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Today’s decision to grant former Presidents immunity for their official acts is deeply wrong.  As troubling as this criminal immunity doctrine is in theory, the majority’s application of the doctrine to the indictment in this case is perhaps even more troubling.  In the hands of the majority, this new official-acts immunity operates as a one-way ratchet.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> First, the majority declares all of the conduct involving the Justice Department and the Vice President to be official conduct, see <em>ante,</em> at 19–24, yet it refuses to designate any course of conduct alleged in the indictment as private, despite concessions from Trump’s counsel.<a aria-label=\"reference 6 of Sotomayor Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-6\" id=\"DISSENT_7-6ref\"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup></a>  Trump’s counsel conceded, for example, that the allegation that Trump &nbsp;“turned to a private attorney who was willing to spread knowingly false claims of election fraud to spearhead his challenges to the election results” “sounds private.”  Tr. of Oral Arg. 29.  He likewise conceded that the allegation that Trump “conspired with another private attorney who caused the filing in court of a verification signed by [Trump] that contained false allegations to support a challenge” “sounds private.”  <em>Ibid.</em>; see also <em>id</em>., at 36–37 (Trump’s counsel explaining that it is not “disputed” that such conduct is “unofficial”).  Again, when asked about allegations that “[t]hree private actors .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. helped implement a plan to submit fraudulent slates of presidential electors to obstruct the certification proceeding, and [Trump] and a co-conspirator attorney directed that effort,” Trump’s counsel conceded the alleged conduct was “private.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 29–30.  Only the majority thinks that organizing fraudulent slates of electors might qualify as an official act of the President, see <em>ante,</em> at 24–28, or at least an act so “interrelated” with other allegedly official acts that it might warrant protection, <em>ante,</em> at 28.  If the majority’s sweeping conception of “official acts” has any real limits, the majority is unwilling to reveal them in today’s decision.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Second, the majority designates certain conduct immune while refusing to recognize anything as prosecutable.  It shields large swaths of conduct involving the Justice Department with immunity, see <em>ante,</em> at 19–21; see also Part V, <em>supra</em>, but it does not give an inch in the other direction.  The majority admits that the Vice President’s responsibility “&nbsp;‘presiding over the Senate’&nbsp;” is “&nbsp;‘not an “executive branch” function,’&nbsp;” and it further admits that the President “plays no direct constitutional or statutory role” in the counting of electoral votes.  <em>Ante,</em> at 23–24.  Yet the majority refuses to conclude that Trump lacks immunity for his alleged attempts to “enlist the Vice President to use his ceremonial role at the January 6 certification proceeding to fraudulently alter the election results.”  App. 187, Indictment &nbsp;¶10(d).  Instead, it worries that a prosecution for this conduct might make it harder for the President to use the Vice President “to advance [his] agenda in Congress.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 24.  Such a prosecution, according to the majority, “may well hinder the President’s ability to perform his constitutional functions.”  <em>Ibid.</em>  Whether a prosecution for this conduct warrants immunity should have been an easy question, but the majority turns it into a debatable one.  Remarkably, the majority goes further and declines to deny immunity even for the allegations that Trump organized fraudulent elector slates, pressured States to subvert the legitimate election results, and exploited violence at the Capitol to influence the certification proceedings.  It is not conceivable that a prosecution for these alleged efforts to overturn a Presidential election, whether labeled official or unofficial under the majority’s test, would pose any “&nbsp;‘dangers of intrusion<em> </em>on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch,’&nbsp;” <em>ante,</em> at 14, and the majority could have said as much.  Instead, it perseverates on a threshold question that should be immaterial.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Looking beyond the fate of this particular prosecution, the long-term consequences of today’s decision are stark.  The Court effectively creates a law-free zone around the President, upsetting the status quo that has existed since the Founding.  This new official-acts immunity now “lies about like a loaded weapon” for any President that wishes to place his own interests, his own political survival, or his own financial gain, above the interests of the Nation.  <em>Korematsu</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"323 U. S. 214\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/323/214\">323 U.&nbsp;S. 214</a>, 246 (1944) (Jackson, J., dissenting).  The President of the United States is the most powerful person in the country, and possibly the world.  When he uses his official powers in any way, under the majority’s reasoning, he now will be insulated from criminal prosecution.  Orders the Navy’s Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival?  Immune.  Organizes a military &nbsp;coup to hold onto power?  Immune.  Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon?  Immune.  Immune, immune, immune.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Let the President violate the law, let him exploit the trappings of his office for personal gain, let him use his official power for evil ends.  Because if he knew that he may one day face liability for breaking the law, he might not be as bold and fearless as we would like him to be.  That is the majority’s message today.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Even if these nightmare scenarios never play out, and I pray they never do, the damage has been done.  The relationship between the President and the people he serves has shifted irrevocably.  In every use of official power, the President is now a king above the law. </p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">*  *  *</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The majority’s single-minded fixation on the President’s need for boldness and dispatch ignores the countervailing need for accountability and restraint.  The Framers were not so single-minded.  In the Federalist Papers, after “endeavor[ing] to show” that the Executive designed by the Constitution “combines .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all the requisites to energy,” Alexander Hamilton asked a separate, equally important question: “Does it also combine the requisites to safety, in a republican sense, a due dependence on the people, a due responsibility?”  The Federalist No. 77, p. 507 (J. Harvard Library ed. 2009).  The answer then was yes, based in part upon the President’s vulnerability to “prosecution in the common course of law.”  <em>Ibid.</em>  The answer after today is no.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Never in the history of our Republic has a President had reason to believe that he would be immune from criminal prosecution if he used the trappings of his office to violate the criminal law.  Moving forward, however, all former Presidents will be cloaked in such immunity.  If the occupant of that office misuses official power for personal gain, the criminal law that the rest of us must abide will not provide a backstop.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> With fear for our democracy, I dissent.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<h3 class=\"fnheader\">Notes</h3>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_7-1\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Sotomayor Dissent at reference 1\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-1ref\">1</a> &nbsp;Article&nbsp;II, §4, provides: “The President, Vice President and all Civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.”</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_7-2\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Sotomayor Dissent at reference 2\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-2ref\">2</a> &nbsp;To note, as the majority does, see <em>ante</em>, at 39, that this Court has recognized civil immunities arguably inconsistent with this view is not to say that Pinckney was wrong about what the Framers had “intended.”  Indeed, Pinckney’s contemporaries shared the same view during the ratification debates.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 4 Debates on the Constitution 109 (J. Elliot ed. 1836) (J. Iredell) (“If the President does a single act by which the people are prejudiced, he is punishable himself. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

See <em>ibid.</em> (noting “the lack of factual analysis in the lower courts, and the lack of briefing on how to categorize the conduct alleged”).  In reaching out to shield some conduct as official while refusing to recognize any conduct as unofficial, the majority engages in judicial activism, not judicial restraint.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"dissent\">&nbsp;<hr><a aria-label=\"Top\" href=\"#writing-ZS\" id=\"writing-23-939_DISSENT_8\"><strong>TOP</strong></a>\n<h2>Dissent</h2>\n<div class=\"bodytext\">\n<p class=\"scusnameplate jy-center\">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p class=\"rule jy-center\">_________________</p>\n<p class=\"casenumber jy-center\">No. 23–939</p>\n<p class=\"rule jy-center\">_________________</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-a jy-center\">DONALD J.

I write separately to explain, as succinctly as I can, the theoretical nuts and bolts of what, exactly, the majority has done today to alter the paradigm of accountability for Presidents of the United States.  I also address what that paradigm shift means for our Nation moving forward.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">I</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> To fully appreciate the profound change the majority has wrought, one must first acknowledge what it means to have immunity from criminal prosecution.  Put simply, immunity is “exemption” from the duties and liabilities imposed by law.  Black’s Law Dictionary 898 (11th ed. 2019); see <em>Hopkins</em> v. <em>Clemson</em>, <a aria-label=\"221 U. S. 636\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/221/636\">221 U.&nbsp;S. 636</a>, 643 (1911) (explaining that immunity is “exemption from legal process”).  In its purest form, the concept of immunity boils down to a maxim—“&nbsp;‘[t]he King can do no wrong’&nbsp;”—a notion that was firmly “rejected at the birth of [our] Republic.”  <em>Clinton</em> v. <em>Jones</em>, <a aria-label=\"520 U. S. 681\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/520/681\">520 U.&nbsp;S. 681</a>, 697, n.&nbsp;24 (1997) (quoting 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *246 (Blackstone)); see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Burr</em>, 25 F.&nbsp;Cas. 30, 34 (No. 14,692d) (CC Va. 1807).  To say &nbsp;that someone is immune from criminal prosecution is to say that, like a King, he “is not under the coercive power of the law,” which “will not suppose him capable of committing a folly, much less a crime.”  4 Blackstone *33.  Thus, being immune is not like having a defense <em>under</em> the law.  Rather, it means that the law does not apply to the immunized person in the first place.  Conferring immunity therefore “create[s] a privileged class free from liability for wrongs inflicted or injuries threatened.”  <em>Hopkins</em>, 221 U.&nbsp;S., at 643.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> It is indisputable that immunity from liability for wrongdoing is the exception rather than the rule in the American criminal justice system.  That is entirely unsurprising, for the very idea of immunity stands in tension with foundational principles of our system of Government.  It is a core tenet of our democracy that the People are the sovereign, and the Rule of Law is our first and final security.  “[F]rom their own experience and their deep reading in history, the Founders knew that Law alone saves a society from being rent by internecine strife or ruled by mere brute power however disguised.”  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Mine Workers</em>, <a aria-label=\"330 U. S. 258\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/330/258\">330 U.&nbsp;S. 258</a>, 308 (1947) (Frankfurter, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> A corollary to that principle sets the terms for this case: “No man in this country is so high that he is above the law.  No officer of the law may set that law at defiance with impunity.  All the officers of the government, from the highest to the lowest, are creatures of the law, and are bound to obey it.”  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Lee</em>, <a aria-label=\"106 U. S. 196\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/106/196\">106 U.&nbsp;S. 196</a>, 220 (1882).  We have long lived with the collective understanding that “[d]ecency, security and liberty alike demand that government officials shall be subjected to the same rules of conduct that are commands to the citizen,” for “[i]n a government of laws, existence of the government will be imperilled if it fails to observe the law scrupulously.”  <em>Olmstead</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"277 U. S. 438\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/277/438\">277 U.&nbsp;S. 438</a>, 485 (1928) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">&nbsp;II</h3>\n<h4 class=\"jy-center\">A</h4>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> These foundational presuppositions are reflected in a procedural paradigm of rules and accountability that operates in the realm of criminal law—what I would call an individual accountability model.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The basic contours of that model are familiar, because they manifest in every criminal case.  Criminal law starts with an act of the legislature, which holds the power “to define a crime, and ordain its punishment.”  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Wiltberger</em>, 5 Wheat. 76, 95 (1820); accord, <em>Ohio</em> v. <em>Johnson</em>, <a aria-label=\"467 U. S. 493\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/467/493\">467 U.&nbsp;S. 493</a>, 499 (1984).  Criminal statutes are laws of general applicability that express “the assent of the people’s representatives” that certain conduct is off limits in our society.  <em>Wooden</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"595 U. S. 360\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/595/360\">595 U.&nbsp;S. 360</a>, 391 (2022) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Gorsuch, J.</span>, concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> When the Federal Government believes that someone has run afoul of a criminal statute and decides to exercise its prosecutorial discretion to pursue punishment for that violation, it persuades a grand jury that there is probable cause to indict.  U.&nbsp;S. Const., Amdt. 5.  Then, the Government marshals evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant engaged in the prohibited conduct and possessed the requisite state of mind.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Bailey</em>, <a aria-label=\"444 U. S. 394\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/444/394\">444 U.&nbsp;S. 394</a>, 402 (1980) (observing that, to hold a person criminally liable, “the concurrence of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ‘an evil-meaning mind [and] an evil-doing hand’&nbsp;” must be proved (quoting <em>Morissette</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"342 U. S. 246\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/342/246\">342 U.&nbsp;S. 246</a>, 251 (1952))).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> For his part, the defendant “stands accused but is presumed innocent until conviction upon trial or guilty plea.”  <em>Betterman</em> v. <em>Montana</em>, <a aria-label=\"578 U. S. 437\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/578/437\">578 U.&nbsp;S. 437</a>, 441 (2016).  Notably, criminal defendants have various constitutionally protected rights during the criminal-liability process, including the rights to a speedy and public trial, the right to have a jury decide guilt or innocence, the right to the assistance &nbsp;of counsel, and the right to confront the witnesses against him.  Amdt. 6.  The defendant also has at his disposal many means to defend himself against the criminal charge.  He can, of course, seek to hold the Government to its burden of proof at trial.  And even before trial, in a motion to dismiss the indictment, he might make any number of legal arguments; he can assert, for example, that the Government’s charging document does not give adequate notice of the charge against him or that the law he has been accused of violating is unconstitutionally vague.  See <em>Hamling</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"418 U. S. 87\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/418/87\">418 U.&nbsp;S. 87</a>, 117 (1974); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Davis</em>, <a aria-label=\"588 U. S. 445\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/588/445\">588 U.&nbsp;S. 445</a>, 451 (2019).  He might further claim that the law is unconstitutional as applied to his particular conduct. See <em>United States</em> v. <em>O’Brien</em>, <a aria-label=\"391 U. S. 367\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/391/367\">391 U.&nbsp;S. 367</a>, 376 (1968).  And he might maintain that his conduct, even if proved, does not violate the law at issue.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Fischer </em>v. <em>United States</em>, 603 U.&nbsp;S. ___, ___ (2024) (slip op., at 2).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The defendant may also raise, and attempt to prove, affirmative defenses that “excuse conduct that would otherwise be punishable.”  <em>Dixon</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"548 U. S. 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/548/1\">548 U.&nbsp;S. 1</a>, 6 (2006).  Generally speaking, affirmative defenses are determinations (often adopted by legislation) that certain conduct otherwise punishable by law is justified.  This might be the case, for example, when the Legislature determines that, under specified circumstances, the societal harm particular conduct causes “is outweighed by the need to avoid an even greater harm.”  1 P. Robinson, Criminal Law Defenses §24(a) (1984) (Robinson).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Importantly, a defense is <em>not</em> an immunity, even though a defense can likewise result in a person charged with a crime avoiding liability for his criminal conduct.  Consistent with our foundational norms, the individual accountability model adheres to the presumption that the law applies to all and that everyone must follow it; yet, the model makes allowances for recognized defenses.  One such defense is the &nbsp;special privilege that Government officials sometimes invoke when carrying out their official duties.<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Jackson Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_8-1\" id=\"DISSENT_8-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> All of this is to say that our Government has long functioned under an accountability paradigm in which no one is above the law; an accused person is innocent until proven guilty; and criminal defendants may raise defenses, both legal and factual, tailored to their particular circumstances, whether they be Government officials or ordinary citizens.  For over two centuries, our Nation has survived with these principles intact.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> With that understanding of how our system of accountability for criminal acts ordinarily functions, it becomes much easier to see that the majority’s ruling in this case breaks new and dangerous ground.  Departing from the traditional model of individual accountability, the majority has concocted something entirely different: a Presidential accountability model that creates immunity—an exemption from criminal law—applicable only to the most powerful official in our Government.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">1</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> So, how does this new Presidential accountability model work? An initial problem is the lack of clarity regarding what this new model entails.  The majority announces only its most basic contours.  See <em>ante,</em> at 6 (asserting that “the &nbsp;nature of Presidential power requires that a former President have some immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts during his tenure in office”).  Instead of no immunity (the individual accountability model) or an unqualified grant of absolute immunity for “<em>all</em> official acts,” Brief for Petitioner 44 (emphasis added), the majority purports to adopt something of a hybrid.<a aria-label=\"reference 2 of Jackson Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_8-2\" id=\"DISSENT_8-2ref\"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a>  It holds that a former President may or may not be immune from criminal prosecution for conduct undertaken while in office, to be determined on a case-by-case basis.  According to the majority, whether a former President is immune depends on how his criminal conduct is classified, as among three possible categories.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> First, with respect to any criminal conduct relating to a President’s “core constitutional powers”—those subjects “within his ‘conclusive and preclusive’ constitutional authority”—the President is entitled to absolute immunity from criminal prosecution.  See <em>ante</em>, at 6, 8.  Second, expanding outward from this “core,” regarding all other “acts within the outer perimeter of [the President’s] official responsibility,” the President is entitled to “at least a <em>presumptive </em>immunity from criminal prosecution.”  <em>Ante</em>, at 14.  &nbsp;Third, if the criminal conduct at issue comprises “unofficial acts, there is no immunity.”  <em>Ante</em>, at 15.<a aria-label=\"reference 3 of Jackson Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_8-3\" id=\"DISSENT_8-3ref\"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Applying the majority’s new Presidential accountability model thus seems to involve bearing down on the indictment’s allegations and making a series of determinations about the nature of the conduct at issue.  From the structure of the paradigm, it appears that the first decision point is whether the alleged criminal conduct involves one of the President’s “core” powers.  If so (and apparently regardless of the degree to which the conduct implicates that core power), the President is absolutely immune from criminal liability for engaging in that criminal conduct.  If not, then one must proceed to consider whether the conduct qualifies as an “official” act or “unofficial” act of that President.  If the crime is an official act, the President is presumptively immune from criminal prosecution and punishment.  But even then, immunity still hinges on whether there is any legal or factual basis for concluding that the presumption of immunity has been rebutted.  Alternatively, if the charged conduct is an unofficial act (a determination that, inci&nbsp;dentally, courts must make without considering the President’s motivations, <em>ante,</em> at 18), the President is not immune.<a aria-label=\"reference 4 of Jackson Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_8-4\" id=\"DISSENT_8-4ref\"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">2</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The majority’s multilayered, multifaceted threshold parsing of the character of a President’s criminal conduct differs from the individual accountability model in several crucial respects.  For one thing, it makes it next to impossible to know <em>ex ante</em> when and under what circumstances a President will be subject to accountability for his criminal acts.  For every allegation, courts must run this gauntlet first—no matter how well documented or heinous the criminal act might be.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Thus, even a hypothetical President who admits to having ordered the assassinations of his political rivals or critics, see, <em>e.g.,</em> Tr. of Oral Arg. 9, or one who indisputably instigates an unsuccessful coup, <em>id</em>., at 41–43, has a fair shot at getting immunity under the majority’s new Presidential accountability model.  That is because whether a President’s conduct will subject him to criminal liability turns on the court’s evaluation of a variety of factors related to the character of that particular act—specifically,<em> </em>those characteristics that imbue an act with the status of “official” or “unofficial” conduct (minus motive).  In the end, then, under the majority’s new paradigm, whether the President will be exempt from legal liability for murder, assault, theft, fraud, &nbsp;or any other reprehensible and outlawed criminal act will turn on whether he committed that act in his official capacity, such that the answer to the immunity question will always and inevitably be: It depends.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Under the individual accountability paradigm, the accountability analysis is markedly less convoluted, and leads to a more certain outcome.  None of the same complications or consequences arise, because, as I have explained, there are no exemptions from the criminal law for any person, but every defendant can assert whatever legal arguments and defenses might be applicable under governing law.  Since no one is above the law, everyone can focus on what the law demands and permits, and on what the defendant did or did not do; no one has to worry about characterizing any criminal conduct as official or unofficial in order to assess the applicability of an immunity at the outset.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The majority’s new Presidential accountability model is also distinct insofar as it accepts as a basic starting premise that generally applicable criminal laws do <em>not</em> apply to everyone in our society.  In the majority’s view, while all other citizens of the United States must do their jobs and live their lives within the confines of criminal prohibitions, the President cannot be made to do so; he must sometimes be exempt from the law’s dictates depending on the character of his conduct.  Indeed, the majority holds that the President, unlike anyone else in our country, is comparatively free to engage in criminal acts in furtherance of his official duties.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> That point bears emphasizing.  Immunity can issue for Presidents under the majority’s model even for unquestionably and intentionally egregious criminal behavior.  Regardless of the nature or the impact of the President’s criminal conduct, so long as he is committing crimes “pursuant to the powers invested exclusively in him by the Constitution,” <em>ante,</em> at 7, or as needed “to carry out his constitutional duties without undue caution,” <em>ante,</em> at 14, he is likely to be &nbsp;deemed immune from prosecution.<a aria-label=\"reference 5 of Jackson Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_8-5\" id=\"DISSENT_8-5ref\"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup></a> </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Ultimately, the majority’s model simply sets the criminal law to one side when it comes to crimes allegedly committed by the President.  Before accountability can be sought or rendered, the Judiciary serves as a newfound special gatekeeper, charged not merely with interpreting the law but with policing whether it applies to the President <em>at all</em>.  Also, under the new Presidential accountability model, the starting presumption is that the criminal law does <em>not</em> apply to Presidents, no matter how obviously illegal, harmful, or unacceptable a President’s official behavior might be.  Regardless of all that, courts must now ensure that a former President is <em>not</em> held accountable for any criminal conduct he engages in while he is on duty, unless his conduct consists primarily (and perhaps solely) of unofficial acts.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both forcejy-center\">3</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The structure and function of the two accountability paradigms are not the only differences—the models also assign different roles to participants in the criminal justice system, and they ultimately generate different relationships between the Presidency and the Rule of Law.  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Under the individual accountability model, duty-bound prosecutorial officers initially exercise their discretion to decide whether to seek punishment for alleged violations of &nbsp;criminal law (a determination that is made based on numerous factors).  And even if prosecutors decide to bring a charge, a jury of the criminal defendant’s peers ultimately determines whether that defendant (including a former President) will actually be held to account for having engaged in unlawful conduct, after the court has resolved any legal challenges and has instructed the jury as to the requirements of the law.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> By contrast, under the majority’s new Presidential accountability paradigm, what a prosecutor or jury does may not even matter, since the courts take center stage once charges are brought against a former President, marshaling their resources to conduct a complex and amorphous threshold immunity evaluation.  Whether a former President will be entirely exempted from the dictates of the law (such that the roles of other participants in the criminal justice process become irrelevant) requires a judicial assessment, in the first instance, of his criminal conduct and the circumstances under which he acted.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Finally, and most importantly, recall that under the individual accountability model, an indicted former President can raise an affirmative defense just like any other criminal defendant.  This means that the President remains answerable to the law, insofar as he must show that he was justified in committing a criminal act while in office under the given circumstances.  In other words, while the President might indeed be privileged to commit a crime in the course of his official duties, any such privilege exists only when the People (acting either through their elected representatives or as members of a jury) determine that the former President’s conduct was in fact justified, notwithstanding the general criminal prohibition.  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Under the majority’s immunity regime, by contrast, the President can commit crimes in the course of his job even under circumstances <em>in which no one thinks he has any excuse</em>; the law simply does not apply to him.  Unlike a defendant who invokes an affirmative defense and relies on a legal determination that there was a good reason for his otherwise unlawful conduct, a former President invoking immunity relies on the premise that he can do whatever he wants, however he wants, so long as he uses his “&nbsp;‘official power’&nbsp;” in doing so.  <em>Ante,</em> at 19.  In the former paradigm, the President remains subject to law; in the latter, he is above it.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">III</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> <span class=\"smallcaps\">Justice Sotomayor</span> has already warned of the dire consequences that are likely to follow from the majority’s decision in this case.  <em>Ante,</em> at 29–30 (dissenting opinion).  I have thus far endeavored merely to explain what today’s ruling amounts to on a theoretical level: the Court’s abandonment of the individual accountability model as applied to Presidents, and its introduction of a new Presidential accountability model that authorizes the Judiciary to exempt Presidents from punishment under law, depending on the official or unofficial character of the criminal conduct at issue.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Here, I will highlight just two observations about the results that follow from this paradigm shift.  First, by changing the accountability paradigm in this fashion, the Court has unilaterally altered the balance of power between the three coordinate branches of our Government as it relates to the Rule of Law, aggrandizing power in the Judiciary and the Executive, to the detriment of Congress.  Second, the majority’s new Presidential accountability model undermines the constraints of the law as a deterrent for future Presidents who might otherwise abuse their power, to the detriment of us all.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">A</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Consider the structural implications of today’s decision from the standpoint of the separation of powers.  Until now, &nbsp;Congress’s laws, passed by the representatives of the People, bound the People and their elected officials just the same.  Law, we have explained, “is the only supreme power in our system of government, and every man who by accepting office participates in its functions is only the more strongly bound to submit to that supremacy, and to observe the limitations which it imposes upon the exercise of the authority which it gives.”  <em>Lee</em>, 106 U.&nbsp;S., at 220.  With its adoption of a paradigm that sometimes exempts the President from the dictates of the law (when the Court says so), this Court has effectively snatched from the Legislature the authority to bind the President (or not) to Congress’s mandates, and it has also thereby substantially augmented the power of both the Office of the Presidency and itself.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> As to the former, it should go without saying that the Office of the Presidency, the apex of the Executive Branch, is made significantly more powerful when the constraints of the criminal law are lifted with respect to the exercise of a President’s official duties.  After today’s ruling, the President must still “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,” Art.&nbsp;II, §3; yet, when acting in his official capacity, he has no obligation to follow those same laws himself.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> But whatever additional power the majority’s new Presidential accountability model gives to the Presidency, it gives doubly to the Court itself, for the majority provides no meaningful guidance about how to apply this new paradigm or how to categorize a President’s conduct.  For instance, its opinion lists some examples of the “core” constitutional powers with respect to which the President is now entitled to absolute immunity—a list that apparently includes the removal power, the power to recognize foreign nations, and the pardon power.  <em>Ante,</em> at 6–9.  However, the majority does not—and likely cannot—supply any useful or administrable definition of the scope of that “core.”  For what it’s worth, the Constitution’s text is no help either; Article II &nbsp;does not contain a Core Powers Clause.<a aria-label=\"reference 6 of Jackson Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_8-6\" id=\"DISSENT_8-6ref\"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup></a>  So the actual metes and bounds of the “core” Presidential powers are really anyone’s guess.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Nor does the majority explain how to consistently distinguish between official and unofficial acts.  Quite the opposite, in fact.  While acknowledging that this is a critical line that courts must draw in order for its new accountability model to work properly, the majority simultaneously cautions that making this distinction “can be difficult”—likely a gross understatement given the recognized “breadth of the President’s ‘discretionary responsibilities’ under the Constitution and laws of the United States.” <em>Ante,</em> at 17.  The majority likewise provides no guidance as to when, how, or why the President’s “presumptive” immunity for noncore official acts might be rebutted, saying only that applying the criminal law to a President’s acts must pose “no ‘dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.’&nbsp;”  <em>Ante,</em> at 14 (quoting <em>Nixon</em> v. <em>Fitzgerald</em>, <a aria-label=\"457 U. S. 731\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/457/731\">457 U.&nbsp;S. 731</a>, 754 (1982)).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> At most, to distinguish official from unofficial conduct, the majority advises asking whether the former President’s conduct was “&nbsp;‘manifestly or palpably beyond [his] authority.’&nbsp;”  <em>Ante,</em> at 17 (quoting <em>Blassingame </em>v. <em>Trump</em>, 87 F.&nbsp;4th 1, 13 (CADC 2023)).  But that test can be illusory, as is evidenced by the facts alleged in this very case.  With respect to the indictment’s allegations concerning petitioner’s attempt to assemble false slates of electors in conjunction &nbsp;with the events of January 6, 2021, for example, the majority admits that the “alleged conduct cannot be neatly categorized,” and that “[t]he analysis therefore .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. may prove to be challenging.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 28–29.  With that, at least, I could not agree more.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This much is clear: Before today, none of these kinds of inquiries was necessary for criminal liability to be fairly assessed with respect to persons accused of having engaged in criminal conduct.  And, frankly, none is needed now—except as relates to the President under the new paradigm the majority has crafted.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Perhaps even more troubling, while Congress (the branch of our Government most accountable to the People) is the entity our Constitution tasks with deciding, as a general matter, what conduct is on or off limits, the Court has now arrogated that power unto itself when that question pertains to the President.  In essence, the Court has now imposed its own preclearance requirement on the application of Congress’s laws to a former President alleged to have committed crimes while in office.  Who will be responsible for drawing the crucial “&nbsp;‘line between [the President’s] personal and official affairs’&nbsp;”?  <em>Ante,</em> at 29. <em> </em>To ask the question is to know the answer.  A majority of this Court, applying an indeterminate test, will pick and choose which laws apply to which Presidents, by labeling his various allegedly criminal acts as “core,” “official,” or “manifestly or palpably” beyond the President’s authority.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Ironically, then, while purportedly seeking to transcend politics, see <em>ante,</em> at 41–42, the Court today displaces the independent judgments of the political branches about the circumstances under which the criminal law should apply.  Effectively, the Court elbows out of the way both Congress and prosecutorial authorities within the Executive Branch, making itself the<em> </em>indispensable player in all future attempts to hold former Presidents accountable to generally applicable criminal laws.  “The Framers, however, did not &nbsp;make the judiciary the overseer of our government.”  <em>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co.</em> v. <em>Sawyer</em>, <a aria-label=\"343 U. S. 579\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/343/579\">343 U.&nbsp;S. 579</a>, 594 (1952) (Frankfurter, J., concurring).  To be sure, this Court may sometimes “have to intervene in determining where authority lies as between the democratic forces in our scheme of government.”  <em>Id</em>., at 597.  But it has long been understood that “we should be wary and humble” when doing so.  <em>Ibid</em>.  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The majority displays no such caution or humility now. Instead, the Court today transfers from the political branches to itself the power to decide when the President can be held accountable.  What is left in its wake is a greatly weakened Congress, which must stand idly by as the President disregards its criminal prohibitions and uses the powers of his office to push the envelope, while choosing to follow (or not) existing laws, as he sees fit.  We also now have a greatly empowered Court, which can opt to allow Congress’s policy judgments criminalizing conduct to stand (or not) with respect to a former President, as a matter of its own prerogative.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> If the structural consequences of today’s paradigm shift mark a step in the wrong direction, then the practical consequences are a five-alarm fire that threatens to consume democratic self-governance and the normal operations of our Government.  The majority shoos away this possibility. <em> Ante,</em> at 37 (accusing the dissents of “strik[ing] a tone of chilling doom that is wholly disproportionate to what the Court actually does today”).  But <span class=\"smallcaps\">Justice Sotomayor </span>makes this point plain, see <em>ante,</em> at 29–30, and I will not belabor it.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Here, I will merely observe that, from a theoretical perspective, philosophers have long considered deterrence to be a key justification for adopting and maintaining systems &nbsp;that ensure accountability for criminal conduct.<a aria-label=\"reference 7 of Jackson Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_8-7\" id=\"DISSENT_8-7ref\"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup></a>  For that same reason, some commentators also maintain that decreasing the certainty of accountability for wrongful acts at least arguably reduces incentives to follow the law.<a aria-label=\"reference 8 of Jackson Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_8-8\" id=\"DISSENT_8-8ref\"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Under the individual accountability model, because everyone is subject to the law, the potential of criminal liability operates as a constraint on the actions and decisions of everyone, including the President.  After today, that reality is no more. Consequently, our Nation has lost a substantial check on Presidents who would use their official powers to commit crimes with impunity while in office.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> So, one might ask, what remains of accountability for Presidents under law?  With today’s paradigm shift, the majority leaves in place only the chance that this Court might someday determine that the criminal conduct in question was an “unofficial” act, or that the Government will somehow rebut the presumption of immunity that applies to a President’s official acts, such that criminal consequences might attach.  But with the parameters of official and unofficial conduct unknown, I think it highly unlikely that a sitting President would feel constrained by these remote possibilities.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; All of this leads me to ponder why, exactly, has the majority concluded that an indeterminate “core”-versus-“official”-versus-“unofficial” line-drawing exercise is the better way to address potential criminal acts of a President?  Could it be that the majority believes the obviously grave dangers of shifting from the individual accountability model to the Presidential accountability model might nevertheless be offset by the great benefits of doing so? Cf. J. Bentham, A Fragment on Government and an Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation 3 (W. Harrison ed. 1948) (arguing that acts can be justified by the maxim that “it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong” (emphasis deleted)).  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Some of the majority’s analysis suggests as much.  As far as I can tell, the majority is mostly concerned that, without immunity, Presidents might “be chilled from taking the ‘bold and unhesitating action’ required of an independent Executive.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 13.  The Court’s opinion candidly laments that application of the law to Presidents might not be evenhanded, and that, as a result, Presidents might be less “&nbsp;‘vigorous’ and ‘energetic’&nbsp;” as executive officers.  <em>Ante,</em> at 10; accord, <em>ante,</em> at 39.  But that concern ignores (or rejects) the foundational principles upon which the traditional individual accountability paradigm is based.  Worse still, promoting more vigor from Presidents in exercising their official duties—and, presumably, less deliberation—invites breathtaking risks in terms of harm to the American people that, in my view, far outweigh the benefits.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This is not to say that the majority is wrong when it perceives that it can be cumbersome for a President to have to follow the law while carrying out his duty to enforce it.  It is certainly true that “[a] scheme of government like ours no doubt at times feels the lack of power to act with complete, all-embracing, swiftly moving authority.”  <em>Youngstown</em>, 343 U.&nbsp;S., at 613 (Frankfurter, J., concurring).  But &nbsp;any American who has studied history knows that “our government was <em>designed</em> to have such restrictions.”  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  Our Constitution’s “separation of powers was adopted by the Convention of 1787, not to promote efficiency but to preclude the exercise of arbitrary power.  The purpose was, not to avoid friction, but .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to save the people from autocracy.”  <em>Myers</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"272 U. S. 52\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/272/52\">272 U.&nbsp;S. 52</a>, 293 (1926) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Having now cast the shadow of doubt over when—if ever—a former President will be subject to criminal liability for any criminal conduct he engages in while on duty, the majority incentivizes all future Presidents to cross the line of criminality while in office, knowing that unless they act “manifestly or palpably beyond [their] authority,” <em>ante,</em> at 17,<em> </em>they will be presumed above prosecution and punishment alike.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> But the majority also tells us not to worry, because “[l]ike everyone else, the President is subject to prosecution in his <em>unofficial</em> capacity.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 40 (emphasis added).  This attempted reassurance is cold comfort, even setting aside the fact that the Court has neglected to lay out a standard that reliably distinguishes between a President’s official and unofficial conduct.  Why?  Because there is <em>still</em> manifest inequity: Presidents alone are now free to commit crimes when they are on the job, while all other Americans must follow the law in all aspects of their lives, whether personal or professional. The official-versus-unofficial act distinction also seems both arbitrary and irrational, for it suggests that the unofficial criminal acts of a President are the only ones worthy of prosecution.  Quite to the contrary, it is when the President commits crimes using his unparalleled official powers that the risks of abuse and autocracy will be most dire.  So, the fact that, “unlike anyone else, the President is” vested with “sweeping powers and duties,” <em>ibid.</em>, actually underscores, rather than undermines, the grim stakes of setting the criminal law to the side when the President &nbsp;flexes those very powers.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The vision John Adams enshrined in the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights—“&nbsp;‘a government of laws and not of men’&nbsp;”—speaks directly to this concept.  <em>Mine Workers</em>, 330 U.&nbsp;S., at 307 (Frankfurter, J., concurring in judgment).  Adams characterized that document as an homage to the Rule of Law; it reflected both a flat “rejection in positive terms of rule by fiat” and a solemn promise that “[e]very act of government may be challenged by an appeal to law.”  <em>Id</em>., at 308.  Thanks to the majority, that vision and promise are likely to be fleeting in the future.  From this day forward, Presidents of tomorrow will be free to exercise the Commander-in-Chief powers, the foreign-affairs powers, and all the vast law enforcement powers enshrined in Article II however they please—including in ways that Congress has deemed criminal and that have potentially grave consequences for the rights and liberties of Americans.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">IV</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> To the extent that the majority’s new accountability paradigm allows Presidents to evade punishment for their criminal acts while in office, the seeds of absolute power for Presidents have been planted.  And, without a doubt, absolute power corrupts absolutely.  “If one man can be allowed to determine for himself what is law, every man can.  That means first chaos, then tyranny.”  <em>Id</em>., at 312.  Likewise, “[i]f the Government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy.”  <em>Olmstead</em>, 277 U.&nbsp;S., at 485 (Brandeis, J., dissenting).  I worry that, after today’s ruling, our Nation will reap what this Court has sown.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Stated simply: The Court has now declared for the first time in history that the most powerful official in the United States can (under circumstances yet to be fully determined) become a law unto himself.  As we enter this uncharted territory, the People, in their wisdom, will need to remain ever &nbsp;attentive, consistently fulfilling their established role in our constitutional democracy, and thus collectively serving as the ultimate safeguard against any chaos spawned by this Court’s decision.  For, like our democracy, our Constitution is “the creature of their will, and lives only by their will.”  <em>Cohens</em> v. <em>Virginia</em>, 6 Wheat. 264, 389 (1821).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> For my part, I simply cannot abide the majority’s senseless discarding of a model of accountability for criminal acts that treats every citizen of this country as being equally subject to the law—as the Rule of Law requires.  That core principle has long prevented our Nation from devolving into despotism.  Yet the Court now opts to let down the guardrails of the law for one extremely powerful category of citizen: any future President who has the will to flout Congress’s established boundaries.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In short, America has traditionally relied on the law to keep its Presidents in line. Starting today, however, Americans must rely on the courts to determine when (if at all) the criminal laws that their representatives have enacted to promote individual and collective security will operate as speedbumps to Presidential action or reaction.  Once self-regulating, the Rule of Law now becomes the rule of judges, with courts pronouncing which crimes committed by a President have to be let go and which can be redressed as impermissible.  So, ultimately, this Court itself will decide whether the law will be any barrier to whatever course of criminality emanates from the Oval Office in the future.  The potential for great harm to American institutions and Americans themselves is obvious.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">*  *  *</h3>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The majority of my colleagues seems to have put their trust in our Court’s ability to prevent Presidents from becoming Kings through case-by-case application of the indeterminate standards of their new Presidential accountability paradigm.  I fear that they are wrong.  But, for all our &nbsp;sakes, I hope that they are right.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In the meantime, because the risks (and power) the Court has now assumed are intolerable, unwarranted, and plainly antithetical to bedrock constitutional norms, I dissent.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<h3 class=\"fnheader\">Notes</h3>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_8-1\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Jackson Dissent at reference 1\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_8-1ref\">1</a> &nbsp; See R.

Petitioner’s argument in both the lower courts and this one was that a former President is categorically immune from federal criminal prosecution for “all” acts within the outer perimeter of his official duties.  See Opening Brief for Defendant-Appellant in No. 23–3228 (CADC, Dec. 23, 2023), p.&nbsp;23; 91 F. 4th 1173, 1188–1189, 1195, 1208 (CADC 2024) (<em>per&nbsp;curiam</em>); Brief for Petitioner 41–47 (arguing for absolute immunity for “all actions within the ‘outer perimeter’&nbsp;” of a President’s responsibilities, and imploring the Court not to adopt a “&nbsp;‘function-based’ approach”).  Thus, it would have been enough for the Court simply to reject petitioner’s categorical claim and leave it at that.  But the majority <em>sua&nbsp;sponte</em> rephrased the question presented, and it now takes full advantage of this opportunity to devise from whole cloth an entirely new legal framework for judicial evaluation of potential criminal immunity for former Presidents.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_8-3\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Jackson Dissent at reference 3\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_8-3ref\">3</a> &nbsp;It is important to note that the majority reframes the immunity question presented here as a separation of powers concern that is compelled by Article II—as if what is being asked is whether Congress can criminalize executive prerogatives.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 6–7; see also <em>ante,</em> at 1–2 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Barrett</span>, J., concurring in part).  But that is not anywhere close to what is happening in this case.  No one maintains that Congress has passed a law that specifically criminalizes the President’s use of any power that the Constitution vests exclusively in the Executive, much less that the Judiciary is being conscripted to adjudicate the propriety of such a statute.  To the contrary, the indictment here invokes criminal statutes of general applicability that everyone is supposed to follow, both on and off the job.  So, the real question is: Can the President, too, be held accountable for committing crimes while he is undertaking his official duties?  The nature of his authority under Article II (whether conclusive and preclusive, or shared with Congress, or otherwise) is entirely beside the point.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_8-4\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Jackson Dissent at reference 4\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_8-4ref\">4</a> &nbsp;<span class=\"smallcaps\">Justice Barrett</span>’s version of the Presidential accountability paradigm works slightly differently; she would have us ask, first, “whether the relevant criminal statute reaches the President’s official conduct.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 2.  But, again, what is at issue here are statutes of general applicability—they only “reach” the President’s conduct to the extent that he chooses to engage in the prohibited behavior.  See n.&nbsp;3, <em>supra</em>.  <span class=\"smallcaps\">Justice Barrett</span>’s framing, thus, sidesteps the fact that, when immunity is being considered, what is actually at issue is whether the President is exempt from punishment if he opts to exercise his official duties using means that violate criminal law.  </p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_8-5\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Jackson Dissent at reference 5\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_8-5ref\">5</a> &nbsp;To fully appreciate the oddity of making the criminal immunity determination turn on the character of the President’s responsibilities, consider what the majority says is one of the President’s “conclusive and preclusive” prerogatives: “&nbsp;‘[t]he President’s power to remove .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. those who wield executive power on his behalf.’&nbsp;”  <em>Ante,</em> at 8 (quoting <em>Seila Law LLC </em>v. <em>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</em>, <a aria-label=\"591 U. S. 197\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/591/197\">591 U.&nbsp;S. 197</a>, 204 (2020)).  While the President may have the authority to decide to remove the Attorney General, for example, the question here is whether the President has the option to remove the Attorney General by, say, poisoning him to death.  Put another way, the issue here is not whether the President has exclusive removal power, but whether a generally applicable criminal law prohibiting murder can restrict <em>how</em> the President exercises that authority. </p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_8-6\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Jackson Dissent at reference 6\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_8-6ref\">6</a> &nbsp;Some of the powers the majority designates as “core” powers are, at best, implied from indefinite constitutional language.

Debit card transactions require merchants to pay an “interchange fee” to the bank that issued the card.  The fee amount is set by the payment networks (such as Visa and MasterCard) that process the transaction.  In 2010 Congress tasked the Federal Reserve Board with making sure that interchange fees were “reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction.”  <a aria-label=\"15 USC 1693\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1693\">15 U. S. C. §1693</a><em>o</em>–2(a)(3)(A).  Discharging this duty, in 2011 the Board published Regulation II, which sets a maximum interchange fee of $0.21 per transaction plus .05% of the transaction’s value.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-d jy-both\">  In 2021, Corner Post joined a suit brought against the Board under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  The complaint challenged Regulation II on the ground that it allows higher interchange fees than the statute permits.  The District Court dismissed the suit as time-barred under <a aria-label=\"28 USC 2401 a\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2401#a\">28 U. S. C. §2401(a)</a>, the default six-year statute of limitations applicable to suits against the United States.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-e jy-both\"><em>Held</em>: An APA claim does not accrue for purposes of §2401(a)’s 6-year statute of limitations until the plaintiff is injured by final agency action.  Pp. 4–23.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\"> (a) The APA grants Corner Post a cause of action subject to certain conditions, see <a aria-label=\"5 USC 702\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/702\">5 U. S. C. §702</a> and §704, and <a aria-label=\"28 USC 2401 a\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2401#a\">28 U. S. C. §2401(a)</a> delineates the time period in which Corner Post may assert its claim.  Section 702 authorizes persons injured by agency action to obtain judicial review by suing the United States or one of its agencies, officers, &nbsp;or employees.  See <em>Abbott Laboratories </em>v. <em>Gardner</em>, <a aria-label=\"387 U. S. 136\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/387/136\">387 U. S. 136</a>, 140–141.  The Court has explained that §702 “requir[es] a litigant to show, at the outset of the case, that he is injured in fact by agency action.”  <em>Director, Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs</em> v. <em>Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"514 U. S. 122\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/514/122\">514 U. S. 122</a>, 127.  A litigant therefore cannot bring an APA claim unless and until she suffers an injury.  While §702 equips injured parties with a cause of action, §704 provides that judicial review is available in most cases only for “final agency action.”  <em>Bennett</em> v. <em>Spear</em>, <a aria-label=\"520 U. S. 154\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/520/154\">520 U. S. 154</a>, 177–178.  Reading §702 and §704 together, a plaintiff may bring an APA claim only after she is injured by final agency action. </p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\"> To determine whether Corner Post’s APA claim is timely, the Court must interpret §2401(a), which provides that civil actions against the United States “shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years after the right of action first accrues.”  The Board says an APA claim “accrues” under §2401(a) when agency action is “final” for purposes of §704; the claim can accrue for purposes of the statute of limitations even before the plaintiff suffers an injury.  The Court disagrees.  A right of action “accrues” when the plaintiff has a “complete and present cause of action,” which is when she has the right to “file suit and obtain relief.”  <em>Green</em> v. <em>Brennan</em>, <a aria-label=\"578 U. S. 547\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/578/547\">578 U. S. 547</a>, 554.  Because an APA plaintiff may not file suit and obtain relief until she suffers an injury from final agency action, the statute of limitations does not begin to run until she is injured.  Pp. 4–6.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\"> (b) Congress enacted §2401(a) in 1948, two years after it enacted the APA.  Section 2401(a)’s predecessor was the statute-of-limitations provision for the Little Tucker Act, which provided for district court jurisdiction over certain claims against the United States.  When Congress revised and recodified the Judicial Code in 1948, it converted the Little Tucker Act’s statute of limitations into §2401(a)’s general statute of limitations for all suits against the Government.  But Congress continued to start the statute of limitations period when the right “accrues.”  Compare <a href=\"/rio/citation/36_Stat._1093\">36 Stat. 1093</a> (“after the right accrued for which the claim is made”) with<em> </em>§2401(a) (“after the right of action first accrues”).</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\"> “Accrue” had a well-settled meaning in 1948, as it does now: A “right accrues when it comes into existence,” <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lindsay</em>, <a aria-label=\"346 U. S. 568\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/346/568\">346 U. S. 568</a>, 569—<em>i</em>.<em>e</em>., “when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action,” <em>Gabelli</em> v. <em>SEC</em>, <a aria-label=\"568 U. S. 442\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/568/442\">568 U. S. 442</a>, 448.  This definition has appeared “in dictionaries from the 19th century up until today,” which explain that a cause of action accrues when a suit may be maintained thereon.  568 U. S., at 448.<em> </em>Thus, a cause of action does not become complete and present—it does not <em>accrue</em>—“until the plaintiff can file suit and obtain relief.”  <em>Bay Area Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund</em> v. <em>Ferbar Corp. of Cal.</em>, <a aria-label=\"522 U. S. 192\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/522/192\">522 U. S. 192</a>, 201.  Contemporaneous legal dictionaries explained that a claim does not “accrue” as soon as the defendant acts, but only after the plaintiff suffers the injury required to press her claim in court.  </p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\"> The Court’s precedent treats this definition of accrual as the “standard rule for limitations periods,” <em>Green</em>, 578 U. S., at 554, and the Court has “repeatedly recognized that Congress legislates against” this standard rule, <em>Graham County Soil &amp; Water Conservation Dist.</em> v. <em>United States ex rel. Wilson</em>, <a aria-label=\"545 U. S. 409\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/545/409\">545 U. S. 409</a>, 418.  Conversely, the Court has “reject[ed]” the possibility that a “limitations period commences at a time when the [plaintiff] could not yet file suit” as “inconsistent with basic limitations principles.”  <em>Bay Area Laundry</em>, 522 U. S., at 200.  The Court will not reach such a conclusion “in the absence of any such indication in the text of the limitations period.”  <em>Green</em>, 578 U. S., at 554.  Departing from the traditional rule is particularly inappropriate here because contemporaneous statutes demonstrate that Congress in 1948 knew how to create a limitations period that begins with the defendant’s action instead of the plaintiff’s injury.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\"> The Board would have this Court interpret §2401(a) as a defendant-protective statute of repose that begins to run when agency action becomes final.  A statute of repose “puts an outer limit on the right to bring a civil action” that is “measured. . . from the date of the last culpable act or omission of the defendant.”  <em>CTS Corp.</em> v. <em>Waldburger</em>, <a aria-label=\"573 U. S. 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/573/1\">573 U. S. 1</a>, 8.  But §2401(a)’s plaintiff-focused language makes it a “statute of limitations,” which—in contradistinction to statutes of repose—are “based on the date when the claim accrued.”  <em>Id</em>., at 7–8.  Pp. 6–10.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\"> (c) The Board’s arguments to the contrary lack merit.  Pp. 10–23.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">  (1) The Board points to the many specific statutory review provisions that start the clock at finality, contending that such statutes reflect a standard administrative-law practice of starting the limitations period when “any proper plaintiff ” can challenge the final agency action.  But unlike the specific review provisions that the Board cites, §2401(a) does <em>not</em> refer to the date of the agency action’s “entry” or “promulgat[ion]”; it says “right of action first accrues.”  That textual difference matters.  The latter language reflects a statute of limitations and the former a statute of repose.  Moreover, the specific review provisions illustrate that Congress has sometimes employed the Board’s preferred final-agency-action rule—but did not do so in §2401(a).  As the Court observed in <em>Rotkiske</em> v. <em>Klemm</em>, it is “particularly inappropriate” to read language into a statute of limitations “when, as here, Congress has shown that it knows how to adopt the omitted language or provision.”  <a aria-label=\"589 U. S. 8\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/589/8\">589 U. S. 8</a>, 14.  Moreover, most of the finality-focused statutes that the Board cites came <em>after</em> §2401(a) was enacted in 1948.  These other, textually distinct statutes therefore do not establish a background presumption that the limitations period for facial challenges to agency rules begins when the rule is final.  Given the settled, plaintiff-centric meaning of “right of action first accrues” in 1948—not to mention in the Little Tucker Act before it—the Board cannot “displace” this “standard rule” for limitations periods.  <em>Green</em>, 578 U. S., at 554.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\"> While the Board argues that §2401(a) should not be interpreted to adopt a “challenger-by-challenger” approach, the standard accrual rule that §2401(a) exemplifies is <em>plaintiff specific</em>.  The Board reads §2401(a) as if it says “the complaint is filed within six years after a<em> </em>right of action [<em>i</em>.<em>e</em>., <em>anyone’s</em> right of action] first accrues”—which it does not say.  Rather, §2401(a)’s text focuses on when the specific plaintiff had the right to sue: It says “<em>the </em>complaint is filed within six years after <em>the </em>right of action first accrues.”  (Emphasis added).  And the Court has explained that the traditional accrual rule looks to when <em>the</em> plaintiff—this particular plaintiff—has a complete and present cause of action.  See <em>Green</em>, 578 U. S., at 554.  No precedent supports the Board’s hypothetical “when could someone else have sued” sort of inquiry.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\"> Importing the Board’s special administrative-law rule into §2401(a) would create a defendant-focused rule for agency suits while retaining the traditional challenger-specific accrual rule for other suits against the United States.  That would give the same statutory text—“right of action first accrues”—different meanings in different contexts, even though those words had a single, well-settled meaning when Congress enacted §2401(a).  The Court “will not infer such an odd result in the absence of any such indication in the text of the limitations period.”  <em>Green</em>, 578 U. S., at 554.  Pp. 10–16.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">  (2) The Board maintains that §2401(a)’s tolling provision—which provides that “[t]he action of any person under legal disability or beyond the seas at the time the claim accrues may be commenced within three years after the disability ceases”—“reflects Congress’s understanding that a claim can ‘accrue[ ]’ for purposes of Section 2401(a)” even when a person is unable to sue.  Brief for Respondent 24.  While true, the tolling exception applies when the plaintiff <em>had</em> a complete and present cause of action after he was injured but his legal disability or absence from the country prevented him from bringing a timely suit.  The exception sheds no light on when the clock started for Corner Post.  P. 16.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">  (3) The Court’s precedents in <em>Reading Co.</em> v. <em>Koons</em>, <a aria-label=\"271 U. S. 58\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/271/58\">271 U. S. 58</a>, and <em>Crown Coat Front Co.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"386 U. S. 503\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/386/503\">386 U. S. 503</a>, do not support the Board’s unusual interpretation of “accrual.” In <em>Koons</em>, the Court held that a statutory wrongful-death claim accrued upon the death of the employee, not on the appointment of an estate administrator, even though the latter was the “only person authorized by the statute to maintain the action.”  <em>Koons</em>, 271 U. S., at 60<em>.  </em>The Board interprets <em>Koons</em> to hold that a claim accrued at a time when no plaintiff could sue, just as it says Corner Post’s claim “accrued” before it could sue.  But in <em>Koons</em>, the beneficiaries on whose behalf any administrator would seek relief—the “real parties in interest”—had the right to “procure the action” after the employee died.  Given this unique context, <em>Koons</em> does not contradict the proposition that a claim generally accrues when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action.  Next, the Board relies on dicta in <em>Crown Coat </em>to support its contention that the word “accrues” can take on different meanings in different contexts.  But the Board misreads <em>Crown Coat</em>, which did not suggest that the words “right of action first accrues” <em>in a single statute</em> should mean different things in different contexts.  Instead, the Court interpreted §2401(a)—the very statute at issue here—to embody the traditional rule that a claim accrues when the plaintiff has the right to bring suit in court.  Pp. 16–20.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">  (4) Finally, the Board raises policy concerns.  It emphasizes that agencies and regulated parties need the finality of a 6-year cut off, and that successful facial challenges filed after six years upset the reliance interests of those that have long operated under existing rules.  But “pleas of administrative inconvenience . . . never ‘justify departing from the statute’s clear text.’ ”  <em>Niz-Chavez</em> v. <em>Garland</em>, <a aria-label=\"593 U. S. 155\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/593/155\">593 U. S. 155</a>, 169 (quoting <em>Pereira </em>v. <em>Sessions</em>, <a aria-label=\"585 U. S. 198\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/585/198\">585 U. S. 198</a>, 217).  Congress could have chosen different language in §2401(a) or created a general statute of repose for agencies, but it did not.  In any event, the Board’s policy concerns are overstated because regulated parties may always challenge a regulation as exceeding the agency’s statutory authority in enforcement proceedings against them.  Moreover, there are significant interests supporting the plaintiff-centric accrual rule, including the APA’s “basic presumption” of judicial review, <em>Abbott Labs.</em>, 387 U. S., at 140, and our “deep-rooted historic tradition that everyone should have his own day in court,” <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Jefferson County</em>, <a aria-label=\"517 U.

S. C. §2401(a)</a>.  We must decide when a claim brought under the Administrative Procedure Act “accrues” for purposes of this provision.  The answer is straightforward.  A claim accrues when the plaintiff has the right to assert it in court—and in the case of the APA, that is when the plaintiff is injured by final agency action.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">I</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Corner Post is a truckstop and convenience store located in Watford City, North Dakota.  It was incorporated in 2017, and in 2018, it opened for business.  Like most merchants, Corner Post accepts debit cards as a form of payment.  While convenient for customers, debit cards are costly for merchants: Every transaction requires them to pay an “interchange fee” to the bank that issued the card.  The amount of the fee is set by the payment networks, like Visa and Mastercard, that process the transaction between &nbsp;the banks of merchants and cardholders.  The cost quickly adds up.  Since it opened, Corner Post has paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in interchange fees—which has meant higher prices for its customers.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Interchange fees have long been a sore point for merchants.  For many years, payment networks had free rein over the fee amount—and because they used the promise of per-transaction profit to compete for the banks’ business, they had significant incentive to raise the fees.  Merchants—who would lose customers if they declined debit cards—had little choice but to pay whatever the networks charged.  Left unregulated, interchange fees ballooned.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Congress eventually stepped in.  The Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 tasks the Federal Reserve Board with setting “standards for assessing whether the amount of any interchange transaction fee . . . is reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction.”  <a href=\"/rio/citation/124_Stat._2068\">124 Stat. 2068</a>, <a aria-label=\"15 USC 1693\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1693\">15 U. S. C. §1693</a><em>o</em>–2(a)(3)(A).  Discharging this duty, the Board promulgated Regulation II, which sets a maximum interchange fee of $0.21 per transaction plus .05% of the transaction’s value.  See Debit Card Interchange Fees and Routing, <a aria-label=\"76 FR 43394\" href=\"/rio/citation/76_FR_43394\">76 Fed. Reg. 43394</a>, 43420 (2011).  The Board published the rule on July 20, 2011.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Four months later, a group of retail-industry trade associations and individual retailers sued the Board, arguing that Regulation II allows costs that the statute does not.  See <em>NACS </em>v. <em>Board of Governors of FRS</em>, 958 F. Supp. 2d 85, 95–96 (DC 2013).  The District Court agreed, <em>id</em>., at 99–109, but the D. C. Circuit reversed, concluding “that the Board’s rules generally rest on reasonable constructions of the statute,” <em>NACS </em>v. <em>Board of Governors of FRS</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/746_F.3d_474\">746 F. 3d 474</a>, 477 (2014).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Corner Post, of course, did not exist when the Board &nbsp;adopted Regulation II or even during the D. C. Circuit litigation.  But after opening its doors, it too became frustrated by interchange fees, and in 2021, joined a suit brought against the Board under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  The complaint alleges that Regulation II is unlawful because it allows payment networks to charge higher fees than the statute permits.  See <a aria-label=\"5 USC 706 2 A\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/706#2_A\">5 U. S. C. §§706(2)(A)</a>, (C).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The District Court dismissed the suit as barred by <a aria-label=\"28 USC 2401 a\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2401#a\">28 U. S. C. §2401(a)</a>, the applicable statute of limitations, 2022 WL 909317, *7–*9 (ND, Mar. 11, 2022), and the Eighth Circuit affirmed, <em>North Dakota Retail Assn.</em> v. <em>Board of Governors of FRS</em>, 55 F. 4th 634 (2022).  Following other Circuits, it distinguished between “facial” challenges to a rule (like Corner Post’s challenge to Regulation II) and challenges to a rule “as-applied” to a particular party.  <em>Id</em>., at 640–641.  The Eighth Circuit held that “when plaintiffs bring a facial challenge to a final agency action, the right of action accrues, and the limitations period begins to run, upon publication of the regulation.”  <em>Id</em>., at 641.  On this view, §2401(a)’s 6-year limitations period began in 2011, when the Board published Regulation II, and expired in 2017, before Corner Post swiped its first debit card.  See <em>id.</em>, at 643.  Corner Post’s suit was therefore too late.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Eighth Circuit’s decision deepened a circuit split over when §2401(a)’s statute of limitations begins to run for APA suits challenging agency action.  At least six Circuits now hold that the limitations period for “facial” APA challenges begins on the date of final agency action—<em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., when the rule was promulgated—regardless of when the plaintiff was injured.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>id</em>., at 641; <em>Wind River Min. Corp. </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/946_F.2d_710\">946 F. 2d 710</a>, 715 (CA9 1991); <em>Dunn-McCampbell Royalty Interest, Inc.</em> v. <em>National Park Serv.</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/112_F.3d_1283\">112 F. 3d 1283</a>, 1287 (CA5 1997); <em>Harris </em>v. <em>FAA</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/353_F.3d_1006\">353 F. 3d 1006</a>, 1009–1010 (CADC 2004); <em>Hire Order Ltd. </em>v. <em>Marianos</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/698_F.3d_168\">698 F. 3d 168</a>, 170 (CA4 2012); <em>Odyssey Logistics &amp; Tech. Corp.</em> v. <em>Iancu</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/959_F.3d_1104\">959 F. 3d 1104</a>, 1111–1112 (CA Fed. &nbsp;2020).  By contrast, the Sixth Circuit has stated a generally applicable rule that §2401(a)’s limitations period begins when the plaintiff is injured by agency action, even if that injury did not occur until many years after the action became final.  <em>Herr </em>v. <em>United States Forest Serv.</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/803_F.3d_809\">803 F. 3d 809</a>, 820–822 (2015) (“When a party first becomes aggrieved by a regulation that exceeds an agency’s statutory authority more than six years after the regulation was promulgated, that party may challenge the regulation without waiting for enforcement proceedings” (emphasis deleted)).<em> </em>We granted certiorari to resolve the split.  600 U. S. ___ (2023).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">II</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Three statutory provisions control our analysis: <a aria-label=\"5 USC 702\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/702\">5 U. S. C. §702</a> and §704, the relevant APA provisions, and <a aria-label=\"28 USC 2401 a\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2401#a\">28 U. S. C. §2401(a)</a>, the relevant statute of limitations.  The APA provisions grant Corner Post a cause of action subject to certain conditions, and §2401(a) sets the window within which Corner Post can assert its claim.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Section 702 authorizes persons injured by agency action to obtain judicial review by suing the United States or one of its agencies, officers, or employees.  See <em>Abbott Laboratories </em>v. <em>Gardner</em>, <a aria-label=\"387 U. S. 136\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/387/136\">387 U. S. 136</a>, 140–141 (1967).  It provides that “[a] person suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute, is entitled to judicial review thereof.”  <a aria-label=\"5 USC 702\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/702\">5 U. S. C. §702</a>.  We have explained that §702 “requir[es] a litigant to show, at the outset of the case, that he is injured in fact by agency action.”  <em>Director, Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs</em> v. <em>Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"514 U. S. 122\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/514/122\">514 U. S. 122</a>, 127 (1995).  Thus, a litigant cannot bring an APA claim unless and until she suffers an injury.<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Barrett Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-1\" id=\"OPINION_4-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; While §702 equips injured parties with a cause of action, §704 limits the agency actions that are subject to judicial review.  Unless another statute makes the agency’s action reviewable (and none does for Regulation II), judicial review is available only for “final agency action.”  §704.  In most cases, then, a plaintiff can only challenge an action that “mark[s] the consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process” and is “one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal consequences will flow.”  <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Spear</em>, <a aria-label=\"520 U. S. 154\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/520/154\">520 U. S. 154</a>, 177–178 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Note that §702’s injury requirement and §704’s finality requirement work hand in hand: Each is a “necessary, but not by itself . . . sufficient, ground for stating a claim under the APA.”  <em>Herr</em>, <a aria-label=\"803 F.3d 819\" href=\"/rio/citation/803_F.3d_819\">803 F. 3d, at 819</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The applicable statute of limitations, <a aria-label=\"28 USC 2401 a\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2401#a\">28 U. S. C. §2401(a)</a>, contains the language we must interpret: “[E]very civil action commenced against the United States shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years <em>after the right of action first accrues</em>.”  (Emphasis added.)  This provision applies generally to suits against the United States unless the timing provision of a more specific statute displaces it.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <a aria-label=\"33 USC 1369 b\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/33/1369#b\">33 U. S. C. §1369(b)</a> (deadline to challenge certain agency actions under the Clean Water Act).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Board contends that an APA claim “accrues” when agency action is “final” for purposes of §704—injury, it says, &nbsp;is necessary for the suit but irrelevant to the statute of limitations.<a aria-label=\"reference 2 of Barrett Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-2\" id=\"OPINION_4-2ref\"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a>  We disagree.  A right of action “accrues” when the plaintiff has a “complete and present cause of action”—<em>i</em>.<em>e</em>., when she has the right to “file suit and obtain relief.”  <em>Green </em>v. <em>Brennan</em>, <a aria-label=\"578 U. S. 547\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/578/547\">578 U. S. 547</a>, 554 (2016) (internal quotation marks omitted).  An APA plaintiff does not have a complete and present cause of action until she suffers an injury from final agency action, so the statute of limitations does not begin to run until she is injured.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">III</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Congress enacted §2401(a) in 1948, two years after it enacted the APA.  See <a href=\"/rio/citation/62_Stat._971\">62 Stat. 971</a>.  Section 2401(a)’s predecessor was the statute-of-limitations provision for the Little Tucker Act, which gave district courts jurisdiction over non-tort monetary claims not exceeding $10,000 against the United States.  See §24, <a href=\"/rio/citation/36_Stat._1093\">36 Stat. 1093</a> (“That no suit against the Government of the United States shall be allowed under this paragraph unless the same shall have been brought within six years after the right accrued for which the claim is made”); Brief for Professor Aditya Bamzai et al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 5–6.  When Congress revised and recodified the Judicial Code in 1948, it converted the Little Tucker Act’s statute of limitations into a general statute of limitations for all &nbsp;suits against the Government—replacing “under this paragraph” with “every civil action against the United States.”  But Congress continued to start the 6-year limitations period when the right “accrues.”  Compare <a href=\"/rio/citation/36_Stat._1093\">36 Stat. 1093</a> (“after the right accrued for which the claim is made”) with<em> </em>§2401(a) (“after the right of action first accrues”).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In 1948, as now, “accrue” had a well-settled meaning: A “right accrues when it comes into existence,” <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lindsay</em>, <a aria-label=\"346 U. S. 568\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/346/568\">346 U. S. 568</a>, 569 (1954)—<em>i</em>.<em>e</em>., “ ‘when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action,’ ” <em>Gabelli</em> v. <em>SEC</em>, <a aria-label=\"568 U. S. 442\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/568/442\">568 U. S. 442</a>, 448 (2013) (quoting <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Kato</em>, <a aria-label=\"549 U. S. 384\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/549/384\">549 U. S. 384</a>, 388 (2007)).  This definition has appeared “in dictionaries from the 19th century up until today.”  <em>Gabelli</em>, 568 U. S., at 448.<em> </em>Legal dictionaries in the 1940s and 1950s uniformly explained that a cause of action “ ‘accrues’ when a suit may be maintained thereon.”  Black’s Law Dictionary 37 (4th ed. 1951) (Black’s); see also, <em>e.g.</em>, Ballentine’s Law Dictionary 15–16 (2d ed. 1948) (Ballentine’s) (“[A]ccrual of cause of action” defined as the “coming or springing into existence of a right to sue” (boldface deleted)).  Thus, we have explained that a cause of action “does not become ‘complete and present’ for limitations purposes”—it does not <em>accrue</em>—“until the plaintiff can file suit and obtain relief.”  <em>Bay Area Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund</em> v. <em>Ferbar Corp. of Cal.</em>, <a aria-label=\"522 U. S. 192\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/522/192\">522 U. S. 192</a>, 201 (1997).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Importantly, contemporaneous dictionaries also explained that a cause of action accrues “on [the] date that damage is sustained and not [the] date when causes are set in motion which ultimately produce injury.”  Black’s 37.  “[I]f an act is not legally injurious until certain consequences occur, it is not the mere doing of the act that gives rise to a cause of action, but the subsequent occurrence of damage or loss as the consequence of the act, and <em>in such case no cause of action accrues until the loss or damage occurs</em>.”  Ballentine’s 16 (emphasis added).  Thus, when Congress used the phrase “right of action first accrues” in &nbsp;§2401(a), it was well understood that a claim does not “accrue” as soon as the defendant acts, but only after the plaintiff suffers the injury required to press her claim in court.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Our precedent treats this definition of accrual as the “standard rule for limitations periods.”  <em>Green</em>, 578 U. S., at 554.  “We have repeatedly recognized that Congress legislates against the ‘standard rule that the limitations period commences when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action.’ ”  <em>Graham County Soil &amp; Water Conservation Dist.</em> v. <em>United States ex rel. Wilson</em>, <a aria-label=\"545 U. S. 409\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/545/409\">545 U. S. 409</a>, 418 (2005) (quoting <em>Bay Area Laundry</em>, 522 U. S., at 201).  It is “unquestionably the traditional rule” that “[a]bsent other indication, a statute of limitations begins to run at the time the plaintiff ‘has the right to apply to the court for relief.’ ”  <em>TRW Inc.</em> v. <em>Andrews</em>, <a aria-label=\"534 U. S. 19\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/534/19\">534 U. S. 19</a>, 37 (2001) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (quoting 1 H. Wood, Limitation of Actions §122a, p. 684 (rev. 4th ed. 1916) (Wood)).  Conversely, we have “reject[ed]” the possibility that a “limitations period commences at a time when the [plaintiff] could not yet file suit” as “inconsistent with basic limitations principles.”  <em>Bay Area Laundry</em>, 522 U. S., at 200.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This traditional rule constitutes a strong background presumption.  While the “standard rule can be displaced such that the limitations period begins to run before a plaintiff can file a suit,” we “ ‘will not infer such an odd result in the absence of any such indication’ in the text of the limitations period.”  <em>Green</em>, 578 U. S., at 554 (quoting <em>Reiter</em> v. <em>Cooper</em>, <a aria-label=\"507 U. S. 258\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/507/258\">507 U. S. 258</a>, 267 (1993)).  “Unless Congress has told us otherwise in the legislation at issue, a cause of action does not become ‘complete and present’ for limitations purposes until the plaintiff can file suit and obtain relief.”  <em>Bay Area Laundry</em>, 522 U. S., at 201.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> There is good reason to conclude that Congress codified the traditional accrual rule in §2401(a).  Nothing “in the text of [§2401(a)’s] limitations period” gives any indication that it begins to run before the plaintiff has a complete and &nbsp;present cause of action.  <em>Green</em>, 578 U. S., at 554.  Rather, §2401(a) uses standard language that had a well-settled meaning in 1948: “right of action first accrues.”  Moreover, Congress knew how to depart from the traditional rule to create a limitations period that begins with the defendant’s action instead of the plaintiff ’s injury: Just six years before it enacted §2401(a), Congress passed the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, which required challenges to Office of Price Administration actions to be filed “[w]ithin a period of sixty days <em>after the issuance of any regulation or order</em>.”  §203(a), <a href=\"/rio/citation/56_Stat._31\">56 Stat. 31</a> (emphasis added); see also Administrative Orders Review Act (Hobbs Act), §4, <a href=\"/rio/citation/64_Stat._1130\">64 Stat. 1130</a> (1950) (allowing petitions for review “within sixty days after entry of ” a “final order reviewable under this Act”).  Section 2401(a), by contrast, stuck with the standard accrual language.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Section 2401(a) thus operates as a statute of limitations rather than a statute of repose.  “[A] statute of limitations creates ‘a time limit for suing in a civil case, based on the date when the claim accrued.’ ”  <em>CTS Corp.</em> v. <em>Waldburger</em>, <a aria-label=\"573 U. S. 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/573/1\">573 U. S. 1</a>, 7–8 (2014) (quoting Black’s 1546 (9th ed. 2009)).  That describes §2401(a), with its reference to when the right of action “accrues,” to a tee.  “A statute of repose, on the other hand, puts an outer limit on the right to bring a civil action” that is “measured not from the date on which the claim accrues but instead from the date of the last culpable act or omission of the defendant.”  573 U. S., at 8.  Such statutes bar “ ‘any suit that is brought after a specified time since the defendant acted . . . even if this period ends before the plaintiff has suffered a resulting injury.’ ”  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting Black’s 1546).  That describes statutes like the Hobbs Act, which sets a filing deadline of 60 days from the “entry” of the agency order.  <a href=\"/rio/citation/64_Stat._1130\">64 Stat. 1130</a>.  Statutes of limitations “require plaintiffs to pursue diligent prosecution of known claims”; statutes of repose reflect a “legislative judgment that a defendant should be free from liability after the &nbsp;legislatively determined period of time.”  <em>CTS Corp.</em>, 573 U. S., at 8–9 (internal quotation marks omitted).<a aria-label=\"reference 3 of Barrett Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-3\" id=\"OPINION_4-3ref\"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></a>  The Board asks us to interpret §2401(a) as a defendant-&nbsp;protective statute of repose that begins to run when agency action becomes final.  But §2401(a)’s plaintiff-focused language makes it an accrual-based statute of limitations.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">*  *  *</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Section 2401(a) embodies the plaintiff-centric traditional rule that a statute of limitations begins to run only when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action.  Because injury, not just finality, is required to sue under the APA, Corner Post’s cause of action was not complete and present until it was injured by Regulation II.  Therefore, its suit is not barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">IV</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The Board concedes that some claims accrue for purposes of §2401(a) when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action—in other words, it admits that “accrue” carries its usual meaning for some claims.  But it argues that facial challenges to agency rules are different, accruing when agency action is final rather than when the plaintiff can assert her claim.  See also <em>post</em>, at 5–6 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Jackson,</span> J., dissenting).  The Board raises several arguments to support its position, but none work.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">A</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The Board puts the most weight on the many specific statutory review provisions that start the clock at finality.  See also <em>post</em>, at 12–15 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Jackson,</span> J., dissenting).  The &nbsp;Hobbs Act, for example, requires persons aggrieved by certain final orders and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission, Secretary of Agriculture, and Secretary of Transportation, among others, to petition for review “within 60 days after [the] entry” of the final agency action.  <a aria-label=\"28 USC\" href=\"/uscode/text/28\">28</a> U. S. C. §§<a aria-label=\"28 USC 2342\" href=\"/uscode/text/28/2342\">2342</a>, <a aria-label=\"28 USC 2344\" href=\"/uscode/text/28/2344\">2344</a>; see also, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <a aria-label=\"29 USC 655\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/655\">29 U. S. C. §655</a>(f ) (suits challenging Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards must be filed “prior to the sixtieth day after such standard is promulgated”).  The Board contends that such statutes reflect a standard administrative-law practice of starting the limitations period when “any proper plaintiff ” can challenge the final agency action.  Brief for Respondent 9.  There is “no sound basis,” it insists, “for instead applying a challenger-by-challenger approach to calculate the limitations period on APA claims.”  <em>Ibid.</em>; see also <em>post</em>, at 9–10 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Jackson,</span> J., dissenting).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">1</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> This argument hits the immutable obstacle of §2401(a)’s text.  Unlike the specific review provisions that the Board cites, §2401(a) does <em>not</em> refer to the date of the agency action’s “entry” or “promulgat[ion]”; it says “right of action first accrues.”  That textual difference matters.  To begin, the latter language reflects a statute of limitations and the former a statute of repose.  Moreover, the specific review provisions actually undercut the Board’s argument, because they illustrate that Congress has sometimes employed the Board’s preferred final-agency-action rule—but did not do so in §2401(a).  As we observed in <em>Rotkiske</em> v. <em>Klemm</em>, it is “particularly inappropriate” to read language into a statute of limitations “when, as here, Congress has shown that it knows how to adopt the omitted language or provision.”  <a aria-label=\"589 U. S. 8\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/589/8\">589 U. S. 8</a>, 14 (2019).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In arguing to the contrary, <em>post</em>, at 12–16, the dissent ignores the textual differences between §2401(a) and finality-&nbsp;focused specific review provisions—flouting <em>Rotkiske</em>’s admonition to heed such distinctions.  According to the dissent, we cannot expect “Congress to have explicitly stated that accrual in §2401(a) starts at the point of final agency action when §2401(a) is a residual provision” that applies generally.  <em>Post</em>, at 15.  But §2401(a)’s text reflects a choice: Congress took the Little Tucker Act’s plaintiff-focused limitations period—which began when “the right accrued for which the claim is made,” <a href=\"/rio/citation/36_Stat._1093\">36 Stat. 1093</a>—and made it generally applicable to “every” suit against the United States, §2401(a); see Part III, <em>supra</em>.  Congress could have created a separate residual provision for suits challenging agency action and pegged its limitations period to the moment of finality, using statutes like the Emergency Price Control Act as a model.  It chose a different path.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Undeterred, the dissent insists that by the time §2401(a) was enacted, Congress had “uniformly expressed [a] judgment” that the limitations period for agency suits should be defendant-centric and start with finality.  <em>Post</em>, at 14.  Again, this argument disregards §2401(a)’s text in favor of alleged congressional intent divined from <em>other</em> statutes with very different language.  “As this Court has repeatedly stated, the text of a law controls over purported legislative intentions unmoored from any statutory text”; the Court “may not ‘replace the actual text with speculation as to Congress’ intent.’ ”  <em>Oklahoma </em>v. <em>Castro-Huerta</em>, <a aria-label=\"597 U. S. 629\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/597/629\">597 U. S. 629</a>, 642 (2022) (quoting <em>Magwood </em>v. <em>Patterson</em>, <a aria-label=\"561 U. S. 320\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/561/320\">561 U. S. 320</a>, 334 (2010)).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In any event, the dissent misunderstands the history.  See <em>post</em>, at 14, and n. 6.  (Notably, the Board itself does not make this argument.)  While the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942 preceded the APA (1946) and §2401(a) (1948), most finality-focused limitations provisions, like the Hobbs Act (1950), came later.  See <em>post</em>, at 12–13, and n. 5; <em>e.g.</em>, <a aria-label=\"5 USC 7703 b 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/7703#b_1\">5 U. S. C. §7703(b)(1)</a> (added by <a href=\"/rio/citation/92_Stat._1143\">92 Stat. 1143</a> (1978)).  To conjure its supposed backdrop, the dissent cites a hodgepodge &nbsp;of other pre-1948 statutes that started the clock at finality. <em>Post</em>, at 14, n. 6.  But these statutes generally governed challenges to orders adjudicating a party’s own rights—what we today might call “as-applied” challenges.  For example, <a aria-label=\"7 USC 194 a\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/7/194#a\">7 U. S. C. §194(a)</a> provided a 30-day limitations period for a meatpacker to appeal an order finding that the packer “has violated or is violating any provision” of the statute regulating business practices in the meatpacking industry.  <a href=\"/rio/citation/42_Stat._161\">42 Stat. 161</a>–162; see also, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <a aria-label=\"15 USC 45 c\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/45#c\">15 U. S. C. §45(c)</a> (persons required by a Federal Trade Commission order to cease a business practice may obtain review of that order within 60 days).  Statutes like these do not contradict the plaintiff-centric standard accrual rule, because a party subject to such an order suffers legally cognizable injury at the same time that the order becomes final.<a aria-label=\"reference 4 of Barrett Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-4\" id=\"OPINION_4-4ref\"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Thus, even if the “intention” Congress “expressed” in textually distinct statutes could overcome §2401(a)’s language, <em>post</em>, at 14, the dissent’s history would not support its supposed background presumption—that the limitations period for facial challenges to regulations begins when the rule becomes final even if the plaintiff does not yet have a complete and present cause of action.  Instead, the best course, as always, is to stick with the ordinary meaning of the text that actually applies, §2401(a).  Given the settled, plaintiff-centric meaning of “right of action first accrues” in &nbsp;1948—not to mention in the Little Tucker Act—the dissent cannot “displace” this “standard rule” with scattered citations to different, inapposite statutes.  <em>Green</em>, 578 U. S., at 554.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">2</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The standard accrual rule that §2401(a)’s limitations period exemplifies is <em>plaintiff</em> <em>specific</em>—even if repose provisions like the Hobbs Act eschew a “challenger-by-&nbsp;challenger” approach.  Brief for Respondent 9.  The Board’s rule would start the limitations period applicable to the plaintiff not when <em>she</em> had a complete and present cause of action but when the agency action was final and, theoretically, some <em>other</em> plaintiff was injured and could have sued.  But §2401(a)’s text focuses on a specific plaintiff: “<em>the</em> complaint is filed within six years after <em>the </em>right of action first accrues.”  (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The dissent disputes §2401(a)’s plaintiff specificity by pointing out that it does not say “<em>the plaintiff ’s</em> right of action first accrues.”  <em>Post</em>, at 9.  True, but it does use the definite article “the” to link “<em>the</em> complaint” with “<em>the </em>right of action.”  So the most natural interpretation is that its limitations period begins when <em>the cause of action associated with the complaint</em>—the plaintiff ’s cause of action—is complete.  And while the dissent cites dictionary definitions of “accrue” that mention “ ‘<em>a</em> right to sue,’ ” <em>ibid</em>., the statute’s use of the definite article “the” takes precedence.  The Board and the dissent read §2401(a) as if it says “the complaint is filed within six years after a<em> </em>right of action [<em>i</em>.<em>e</em>., <em>anyone’s</em> right of action] first accrues”—which, of course, it does not.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In fact, we have explained that the traditional accrual rule looks to when “<em>the</em> plaintiff ”—this particular plaintiff—“has a complete and present cause of action.”  <em>Green</em>, 578 U. S., at 554 (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added).  No precedent suggests that the traditional rule contemplates the Board’s hypothetical “when could &nbsp;someone else have sued” sort of inquiry.<a aria-label=\"reference 5 of Barrett Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-5\" id=\"OPINION_4-5ref\"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup></a>  Rather, the “statute of limitations begins to run at the time <em>the plaintiff</em> has the right to apply to the court for relief.”  <em>TRW Inc.</em>, 534 U. S., at 37 (opinion of Scalia, J.) (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added).<a aria-label=\"reference 6 of Barrett Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-6\" id=\"OPINION_4-6ref\"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Importing the Board’s special administrative-law rule into §2401(a) would create a defendant-focused rule for agency suits while retaining the traditional challenger-&nbsp;specific accrual rule for other suits against the United States.  That would give the same statutory text—“right of action first accrues”—different meanings in different contexts, even though those words had a single, well-settled meaning when Congress enacted §2401(a).  See<em> </em>Part III, <em>supra</em>.  The Board’s interpretation would thereby decouple the statute of limitations from any injury “such that the limitations period begins to run before a plaintiff can file a suit”—for <em>some</em>, <em>but not all</em>, suits governed by §2401(a).  <em>Green</em>, 578 U. S., at 554.  We “will not infer such an odd result in the &nbsp;absence of any such indication in the text of the limitations period.”  <em>Ibid. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"><em> </em>Turning to §2401(a)’s text, the Board draws significance from this sentence: “The action of any person under legal disability or beyond the seas at the time the claim accrues may be commenced within three years after the disability ceases.”  This language, the Board stresses, “necessarily reflects Congress’s understanding that a claim can ‘accrue[ ]’ for purposes of Section 2401(a)” even when a person is unable to sue.  Brief for Respondent 24.  True enough.  It is a mystery, however, why the Board finds this helpful.  The tolling exception applies when the plaintiff <em>had</em> a complete and present cause of action after he was injured but his legal disability or absence from the country “prevent[ed] him from bringing a timely suit.”  <em>Goewey</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 222 Ct. Cl. 104, 113, <a href=\"/rio/citation/612_F.2d_539\">612 F. 2d 539</a>, 544 (1979) (<em>per curiam</em>).  What matters for accrual is when the plaintiff had “the <em>right </em>to apply to the court for relief,” not whether some external impediment prevented her from doing so.  Wood §122a, at 684 (emphasis added).  The exception, therefore, sheds no light on when the clock started ticking for Corner Post—but it does show Congress’s concern for plaintiffs who might lose a cause of action through no fault of their own.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">C</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"><em> </em>The Board also leans on our precedent—namely, <em>Reading Co.</em> v. <em>Koons</em>, <a aria-label=\"271 U.S. 58\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/271/58\">271 U. S. 58 (1926)</a>, and <em>Crown Coat Front Co.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"386 U.S. 503\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/386/503\">386 U. S. 503 (1967)</a>—to support its unusual interpretation of “accrual.”  See also <em>post</em>, at 6–9 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Jackson,</span> J., dissenting).  Again, the Board comes up empty.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In <em>Koons</em>, we interpreted the statute of limitations under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act, which barred actions &nbsp;brought more than two years after “ ‘the cause of action accrued.’ ”  271 U. S., at 60 (quoting ch. 149, §6, <a href=\"/rio/citation/35_Stat._66\">35 Stat. 66</a>).  We held that the plaintiff ’s wrongful-death claim accrued when the employee died, even though the estate’s administrator was not appointed until later and the administrator was “the only person authorized by the statute to maintain the action.”  271 U. S., at 60.<em> </em>The Board interprets <em>Koons</em> to hold that a claim accrued at a time when no plaintiff could sue.  Thus, the Board reasons, it is consistent with the meaning of “accrue” to say that Corner Post’s claim “accrued” before it could sue.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Board’s characterization of <em>Koons</em> is incomplete.  <em>Koons </em>explained that the administrator “acts only for the benefit of persons specifically designated in the statute,” and at the “time of death there are identified persons for whose benefit the liability exists and who can start the machinery of the law in motion to enforce it, by applying for the appointment of an administrator.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 62.  If a beneficiary sued in her individual capacity immediately after the employee’s death, she could amend her suit to describe herself as “executor or administrator of the decedent.”  <em>Ibid. </em> So “at the death of decedent, there are real parties in interest who may procure the action to be brought.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 62–63.  While it is true that the claim accrued before any particular administrator was appointed, the beneficiaries on whose behalf any administrator would seek relief—the “real parties in interest”—had the right to “procure the action” after the employee died.  Given this unique context, <em>Koons</em> does not contradict the proposition that a claim generally accrues when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Nor does <em>Crown Coat</em>.  That case concerned a contract dispute in which a Government contractor sought an equitable adjustment to the payment it received.  386 U. S., at 507.  The contract required the contractor to present its claim to the contracting officer and Armed Services Board &nbsp;of Contract Appeals; its claim was “not subject to adjudication in the courts” until it was denied by the Board.  <em>Id</em>., at 511.  The question presented was whether §2401(a)’s statute of limitations began to run when the Board issued its final determination or at an earlier date.  <em>Id</em>., at 507.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> We held that the right of action first accrued when the Board denied the contractor’s claim, because the contractor had “the right to resort to the courts only upon the making of that administrative determination.”  <em>Id</em>., at 512.  We explained that §2401(a)’s phrase “right of action” refers to “the right to file a civil action in the courts against the United States.”  <em>Id</em>., at 511.  Given the contract’s administrative-exhaustion requirement, “the contractor’s claim was subject only to administrative, not judicial, determination in the first instance”; the plaintiff was “not legally entitled to ask the courts to adjudicate [its] claim as an original matter.”  <em>Id</em>., at 511–512, 515.  So its “claim or right to bring a civil action against the United States” did not “matur[e]” until the Board made its final decision.  <em>Id</em>., at 514.  <em>Crown Coat </em>thus supports Corner Post: The Court interpreted §2401(a) to embody the traditional rule that a claim accrues when the plaintiff has the right to bring suit in court.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Notwithstanding <em>Crown Coat</em>’s holding, the Board and the dissent try to marshal support from its dicta.  The Court noted that it is hazardous “to define for all purposes when a ‘cause of action’ first ‘accrues’ ”; it cautioned that those words should be “ ‘interpreted in the light of the general purposes of the statute and of its other provisions’ ” and the “ ‘practical ends’ ” served by time limitations.  <em>Id</em>., at 517 (quoting <em>Koons</em>, 271 U. S., at 62).  Seizing on this language, the Board insists that the word “accrues” is a chameleon, taking on different meanings in different contexts—and in the administrative-law context, a right of action “accrues” when a regulation is final, full stop.  See also <em>post</em>, at 6 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Jackson,</span> J., dissenting) (citing <em>Crown Coat </em>for the proposition that “the word ‘accrues’ lacks any fixed meaning”).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; The Board and the dissent vastly overread—in fact, they misread—<em>Crown Coat</em>.  The Court did not suggest that the same words “right of action first accrues” <em>in a single statute</em> should mean different things in different contexts—which is how the Board and the dissent would have us interpret §2401(a).  Rather, the Court made its observation in the course of distinguishing §2401(a) from a statutory scheme that departed from the traditional accrual rule.<a aria-label=\"reference 7 of Barrett Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-7\" id=\"OPINION_4-7ref\"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup></a>  386 U. S., at 516–517.  Moreover, as we have already explained, the Court interpreted §2401(a)—the very statute at issue in this case—to start the clock when the plaintiff is “legally entitled” to file suit.  <em>Id.</em>, at 515.  It also specifically rejected the Government’s position that the time can run even before a plaintiff ’s “civil action against the United States matures.”  <em>Id</em>., at 514; see also <em>ibid.</em> (noting that the Government’s position “would have unfortunate impact”).  We therefore do not read <em>Crown Coat</em>’s “general purposes” language to contradict either its holding or the “ ‘standard rule’ for limitations periods.”  <em>Green</em>, 578 U. S., at 554.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Even if <em>Crown Coat</em>’s dicta supported sapping “accrues” of any “fixed meaning,” <em>post</em>, at 6 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Jackson,</span> J., dissenting), this approach has been contravened by the weight of subse&nbsp;quent precedent.  Our limitations cases from the last several decades have instead emphasized the strength of the traditional, plaintiff-centric accrual rule and demanded that departures be justified by the statutory “text of the limitations period.”  <em>Green</em>, 578 U. S., at 554; see also, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Graham County</em>, 545 U. S., at 418–419 (explaining that in <em>Reiter </em>v.<em> Cooper</em>, 507 U. S., at 267, the Court “declin[ed] to countenance the ‘odd result’ that a federal cause of action and statute of limitations arise at different times ‘absen[t] . . . any such indication in the statute’ ”); <em>Bay Area Laundry</em>, 522 U. S., at 201.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">D</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Finally, the Board raises policy concerns.  It emphasizes that agencies and regulated parties need the finality of a 6-year cutoff.  After that point, facial challenges impose significant burdens on agencies and courts.  Moreover, if they are successful, such challenges upset the reliance interests of the agencies and regulated parties that have long operated under existing rules.  See also <em>post</em>, at 18–24 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Jackson,</span> J., dissenting).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> “[P]leas of administrative inconvenience . . . never ‘justify departing from the statute’s clear text.’ ”  <em>Niz-Chavez</em> v. <em>Garland</em>, <a aria-label=\"593 U. S. 155\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/593/155\">593 U. S. 155</a>, 169 (2021) (quoting <em>Pereira </em>v. <em>Sessions</em>, 585 U. S 198, 217 (2018)).  Congress could have chosen different language in §2401(a) or created a general statute of repose for agencies.  It did not.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> That is enough to dispatch the Board’s policy arguments, but we add that its concerns are overstated.  Put aside facial challenges like Corner Post’s.  Regulated parties “may always assail a regulation as exceeding the agency’s statutory authority in enforcement proceedings against them” or “petition an agency to reconsider a longstanding rule and then appeal the denial of that petition.”  <em>Herr</em>, <a aria-label=\"803 F.3d 821\" href=\"/rio/citation/803_F.3d_821\">803 F. 3d, at 821</a>–822.  So even on the Board’s preferred interpretation, “[a] federal regulation that makes it six years without being &nbsp;contested does not enter a promised land free from legal challenge.”  <em>Id</em>., at 821.  Likewise, the dissent imagines an alternative reality of total finality that simply does not exist.  See <em>post</em>, at 21–23.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Moreover, the opportunity to challenge agency action does not mean that new plaintiffs will always win or that courts and agencies will need to expend significant resources to address each new suit.  Given that major regulations are typically challenged immediately, courts entertaining later challenges often will be able to rely on binding Supreme Court or circuit precedent.  If neither this Court nor the relevant court of appeals has weighed in, a court may be able to look to other circuits for persuasive authority.  And if no other authority upholding the agency action is persuasive, the court may have more work to do, but there is all the more reason for it to consider the merits of the newcomer’s challenge.<a aria-label=\"reference 8 of Barrett Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-8\" id=\"OPINION_4-8ref\"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Turning to the other side of the policy ledger, the Board slights the arguments supporting the plaintiff-centric accrual rule.  In addition to being compelled by §2401(a)’s text, this rule vindicates the APA’s “basic presumption” that anyone injured by agency action should have access to judicial review.  <em>Abbott Labs.</em>, 387 U. S., at 140.  It also respects our “deep-rooted historic tradition that everyone &nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp;should have his own day in court.”  <em>Richards</em> v. <em>Jefferson County</em>, <a aria-label=\"517 U. S. 793\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/517/793\">517 U. S. 793</a>, 798 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Under the Board’s finality rule, only those fortunate enough to suffer an injury within six years of a rule’s promulgation may bring an APA suit.  Everyone else—no matter how serious the injury or how illegal the rule—has no recourse.<a aria-label=\"reference 9 of Barrett Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-9\" id=\"OPINION_4-9ref\"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The dissent also raises a host of policy arguments masquerading as “matter[s] of congressional intent.”  <em>Post</em>, at 18–24.  And it warns that today’s opinion will “devastate the functioning of the Federal Government.”  <em>Post</em>, at 23. <em> </em>This claim is baffling—indeed, bizarre—in a case about a statute of limitations.  The Solicitor General, whose mandate is to protect the interests of the Federal Government, comes nowhere close to suggesting that a plaintiff-centric interpretation of §2401(a) spells the end of the United States as we know it.  Perhaps the dissent believes that the Code of Federal Regulations is full of substantively illegal regulations vulnerable to meritorious challenges; or perhaps it believes that meritless challenges will flood federal courts that are too incompetent to reject them.  We have more confidence in both the Executive Branch and the Judiciary.  But we do agree with the dissent on one point: “ ‘[T]he ball is in Congress’ court.’ ”  <em>Post</em>, at 24 (quoting <em>Ledbetter</em> v. <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"550 U. S. 618\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/550/618\">550 U. S. 618</a>, 661 (2007) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting)).  Section 2401(a) is 75 years old.  If it is a poor fit for modern APA litigation, the &nbsp;solution is for Congress to enact a distinct statute of limitations for the APA.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">*  *  *</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> An APA claim does not accrue for purposes of §2401(a)’s 6-year statute of limitations until the plaintiff is injured by final agency action.  Because Corner Post filed suit within six years of its injury, §2401(a) did not bar its challenge to Regulation II.  We reverse the Eighth Circuit’s judgment to the contrary and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"></p>\n<p class=\"flushrgtpara jy-right\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<h3 class=\"fnheader\">Notes</h3>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-1\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Barrett Opinion at reference 1\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-1ref\">1</a>  The dissent asserts that §702 “restricts <em>who </em>may challenge agency&nbsp;&nbsp; action,” yet its injury requirement “says nothing about” the cause of action or elements of the claim.  <em>Post</em>, at 16.  But surely the dissent does not mean to suggest that an <em>uninjured</em> person may bring an APA claim.  Whether one calls injury a restriction on who may sue or an element of the cause of action, the relevant, undisputed point is that a plaintiff cannot sue under the APA unless she is “injured in fact by agency action.”  <em>Newport News</em>, 514 U.

But Corner Post, as a merchant rather than a payment network, is not regulated by Regulation II—so it will never be the target of an enforcement action in which it could challenge that rule.  <span class=\"smallcaps\">Justice Kavanaugh</span> asserts that “Corner Post can obtain relief in this case only because the APA authorizes vacatur of agency rules.”  <em>Post</em>, at 1 (concurring opinion).  Whether the APA authorizes vacatur has been subject to thoughtful debate by Members of this Court.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Texas</em>, <a aria-label=\"599 U.

We took this case only to decide how §2401(a)’s statute of limitations applies to APA claims.

Hickman &amp; R. Pierce, 1 Administrative Law §1.3, p. 26 (7th ed. 2024).  The dissent errs by extrapolating a general congressional intent that all agency suits be subject to a finality-based limitations rule based on pre-1948 statutes that governed a subset of agency actions—adjudicative orders—and were enacted before facial challenges to regulations became common.  It is hard to see how provisions governing when a party may challenge an order adjudicating her own rights could set any kind of background rule for facial APA challenges to generally applicable regulations. </p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-5\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Barrett Opinion at reference 5\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-5ref\">5</a>  While the dissent attempts to cabin our precedent describing the plaintiff-specific standard accrual rule, nothing in those cases suggests that the rule is only plaintiff-specific for “plaintiff-specific causes of action.”  <em>Post</em>, at 10; see, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Gabelli </em>v.<em> SEC</em>, <a aria-label=\"568 U.

And regardless, the dissent’s assertion that “administrative-law claims” are <em>not</em> “plaintiff specific,” <em>post</em>, at 6, is mystifying given that an APA plaintiff cannot sue until <em>she </em>suffers an injury, see <a aria-label=\"5 USC 702\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/702\">5 U. S. C. §702</a>; n. 1, <em>supra</em>.  By emphasizing the plaintiff-agnostic aspects of facial challenges to agency action, <em>post</em>, at 10, 16–18, the dissent conflates the defendant-focused <em>substance</em> of an APA claim with its plaintiff-specific <em>cause of action</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-6\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Barrett Opinion at reference 6\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-6ref\">6</a>  Moreover, there may be cases where <em>no one</em> is injured and able to sue at the time of final agency action—<em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., if the agency delays a rule’s enforcement—but the Board would still start the clock then.  Cf. <em>Toilet Goods Assn., Inc.</em> v. <em>Gardner</em>, <a aria-label=\"387 U. S. 158\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/387/158\">387 U. S. 158</a>, 162–166 (1967) (agency rule was final but challenge was not yet ripe).  So the Board’s position cannot be reconciled even with a challenger-agnostic form of the traditional accrual rule, which at least would require that <em>someone</em> have a complete and present cause of action before the limitations period begins.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-7\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Barrett Opinion at reference 7\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-7ref\">7</a>  The Court distinguished the limitations scheme at issue in <em>McMahon </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"342 U.S. 25\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/342/25\">342 U. S. 25 (1951)</a>.  That scheme involved two statutes: one requiring “actions to be brought within two years after ‘the cause of action arises’ ” and another “permit[ting] court action only if the claim ha[d] been administratively disallowed, but set[ting] no time within which a claim must be presented to the administrative body.”  <em>Crown Coat</em>, 386 U. S., at 516–517.  The <em>McMahon</em> Court held that the claim accrued not after the administrative disallowance that would enable the plaintiff to sue in court, but at the time of the plaintiff ’s earlier injury.  342 U. S., at 27.  <em>Crown Coat </em>attributed this holding to the unique two-statute context: “[P]ostpon[ing] the usual time of accrual of the cause of action [<em>i</em>.<em>e</em>., the time of injury] until the date of disallowance” would have “permit[ted] the claimant to postpone indefinitely the commencement of the running of the statutory period.”  386 U.

Corner Post suggests that only parties that existed during the rulemaking process can claim to have been injured by a “procedural” shortcoming, like a deficient notice of proposed rulemaking.  Reply Brief 18–19.  We need not resolve that issue here because there is no dispute that Corner Post proffered an injury that does not depend on its having existed when the Board promulgated Regulation II: the rule’s alleged conflict with the Durbin Amendment.  The dissent’s observation that “the claims in this case <em>are </em>procedural,” <em>post</em>, at 18, is confused.  Even if some of Corner Post’s claims might be procedural, its central claim—that the regulation violates the statute—is a prototypical substantive challenge.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-9\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Barrett Opinion at reference 9\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-9ref\">9</a>  Corner Post has no other way to obtain meaningful review of Regulation II.  Because Regulation II does not directly regulate it, it will never be subject to enforcement actions in which it may challenge the rule’s legality.  See n. 2, <em>supra</em>.  Nor is the ability to petition the Board for rulemaking to change Regulation II a sufficient substitute for <em>de novo</em> judicial review of its lawfulness: The agency’s “discretionary decision to decline to take new action” would be subject only to “deferential judicial review.”  <em>PDR Network, LLC </em>v. <em>Carlton &amp; Harris Chiropractic, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"588 U.

I also agree with the Court that today’s decision vindicates the APA’s “ ‘basic presumption’ that anyone injured by agency action should have access to judicial review.”  <em>Ante</em>, at 21 (quoting <em>Abbott Laboratories</em> v. <em>Gardner</em>, <a aria-label=\"387 U. S. 136\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/387/136\">387 U. S. 136</a>, 140 (1967)).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> I write separately to explain a crucial additional point:  Corner Post can obtain relief in this case only because the APA authorizes vacatur of agency rules.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Corner Post challenged an agency rule that regulates the fees that banks may charge.  But Corner Post is not a bank regulated by the rule.  Rather, it is a business that must pay the fees charged by the banks who are regulated by the rule.  Corner Post complains that the agency rule allows banks to charge fees that are unreasonably high.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Corner Post’s suit is a typical APA suit.  An unregulated plaintiff such as Corner Post often will sue under the APA to challenge an allegedly unlawful agency rule that regulates others but also has adverse downstream effects on the plaintiff.  In those cases, an injunction barring the agency from enforcing the rule against the plaintiff would not help the plaintiff, because the plaintiff is not regulated &nbsp;by the rule in the first place.  Instead, the unregulated plaintiff can obtain meaningful relief only if the APA authorizes vacatur of the agency rule, thereby remedying the adverse downstream effects of the rule on the unregulated plaintiff.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The APA empowers federal courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that, as relevant here, is arbitrary and capricious or is contrary to law.  <a aria-label=\"5 USC 706 2\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/706#2\">5 U. S. C. §706(2)</a>.  The Federal Government and the federal courts have long understood §706(2) to authorize vacatur of unlawful agency rules, including in suits by unregulated plaintiffs who are adversely affected by an agency’s regulation of others.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Recently, the Government has advanced a far-reaching argument that the APA does not allow vacatur.  See Brief for Respondent 42; Brief for United States in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, O. T. 2022, No. 22–58, pp. 40–44.  Invoking a few law review articles, the Government contends that the APA’s authorization to “set aside” agency action does not allow vacatur, but instead permits a court only to enjoin an agency from enforcing a rule against the plaintiff.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> If the Government were correct on that point, Corner Post could not obtain any relief in this suit because, to reiterate, Corner Post is not regulated by the rule to begin with.  And the APA would supply no remedy for most other <em>unregulated</em> but adversely affected parties who traditionally have brought, and regularly still bring, APA suits challenging agency rules.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Government’s position would revolutionize long-settled administrative law—shutting the door on entire classes of everyday administrative law cases.  The Government’s newly minted position is both novel and wrong.  It “disregards a lot of history and a lot of law.”  M. Sohoni, The Past and Future of Universal Vacatur, 133 Yale L. J. 2305, 2311 (2024).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The APA authorizes vacatur of agency rules; therefore, Corner Post can obtain relief in this case.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">&nbsp;I</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Corner Post owns a truck stop and convenience store in rural North Dakota.  When a customer uses a debit card at its business, Corner Post must pay a fee (known as an interchange fee) to the bank that processes the customer’s transaction.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> As the Court explains, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal Reserve Board to “prescribe regulations” for assessing whether interchange fees are “reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred” in processing a debit-card transaction.  <a aria-label=\"15 USC 1693\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1693\">15 U. S. C. §1693</a><em>o</em>–2(a)(3)(A); see <em>ante</em>, at 2.  Pursuant to the Act, the Board has issued a rule that sets a maximum fee of about 21 cents per transaction.  <a aria-label=\"76 FR 43394\" href=\"/rio/citation/76_FR_43394\">76 Fed. Reg. 43394</a>, 43420 (2011).  For convenience, I will refer to that rule as the fee rule.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Corner Post is not subject to the fee rule.  Corner Post does not charge interchange fees to its customers, and Corner Post lacks any authority to set those fees.  But because Corner Post must <em>pay</em> the fees to banks, it is affected by the agency’s rule setting the maximum fees that banks may charge.  In particular, Corner Post would be harmed by a fee rule that allows unreasonably high fees and would benefit from a fee rule that more strictly limits the fees that banks may charge.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The APA authorizes any person who has been “adversely affected or aggrieved” by a “final agency action” to obtain judicial review in federal district court.  <a aria-label=\"5 USC\" href=\"/uscode/text/5\">5</a> U. S. C. §§<a aria-label=\"5 USC 702\" href=\"/uscode/text/5/702\">702</a>, <a aria-label=\"5 USC 704\" href=\"/uscode/text/5/704\">704</a>.  In an APA suit, the district court “shall” “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  §706(2)(A).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Corner Post filed this APA suit because it believes that the fee rule allows banks to charge unreasonably high fees.  In particular, Corner Post argues that the Board’s 21-cent fee cap is unreasonably high and therefore arbitrary and capricious under the APA.  Corner Post asked the Federal &nbsp;District Court to vacate the fee rule on the ground that the Board must more strictly regulate bank fees (in other words, that the Board must set a lower cap on the fees that banks may charge).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Corner Post would not be able to obtain relief in its lawsuit through any remedy other than vacatur.  Corner Post could not obtain relief through an injunction forbidding the Board from enforcing the rule against it.  That is because the rule does not regulate Corner Post and therefore is not and cannot be enforced against Corner Post in the first place.  Nor could Corner Post secure relief through an injunction against banks; the APA does not authorize suits against private parties.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Corner Post instead needs a remedy that acts directly on the fee rule—specifically, by vacating it.  Indeed, without vacatur, it is hard to imagine what kind of lawsuit Corner Post could file.  At oral argument, the Government ultimately seemed to acknowledge that reality and the necessity of the vacatur remedy if Corner Post is to obtain any relief in this case.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 76 (“it’s possible that the only way to provide this party relief would be vacatur”).<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Kavanaugh Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_5-1\" id=\"CONCUR_5-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">II</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> For Corner Post to obtain relief, an important question therefore is whether the APA authorizes vacatur of unlawful agency actions, including agency rules.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The answer is yes—in light of the text and history of the &nbsp;APA, the longstanding and settled precedent adhering to that text and history, and the radical consequences for administrative law and individual liberty that would ensue if vacatur were suddenly no longer available.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The text and history of the APA authorize vacatur.  The text directs courts to “set aside” unlawful agency actions.  <a aria-label=\"5 USC 706 2 A\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/706#2_A\">5 U. S. C. §706(2)(A)</a>.  When Congress enacted the APA in 1946, the phrase “set aside” meant “cancel, annul, or revoke.”  Black’s Law Dictionary 1612 (3d ed. 1933); see also Black’s Law Dictionary 1537 (4th ed. 1951) (same); Bouvier’s Law Dictionary 1103 (W. Baldwin ed. 1926) (“To annul; to make void; as, to set aside an award”).  At that time, it was common for an appellate court that reversed the decision of a lower court to direct that the lower court’s “judgment” be “set aside,” meaning vacated.  <em>E</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Shawkee Mfg. Co.</em> v. <em>Hartford-Empire Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"322 U. S. 271\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/322/271\">322 U. S. 271</a>, 274 (1944).  Likewise, Congress used the phrase “set aside” in many pre-APA statutes that plainly contemplated the vacatur of agency actions.<a aria-label=\"reference 2 of Kavanaugh Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_5-2\" id=\"CONCUR_5-2ref\"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The APA incorporated that common and contemporaneous meaning of “set aside.”  When a federal court sets aside an agency action, the federal court vacates that order—in much the same way that an appellate court vacates the judgment of a trial court.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The APA prescribes the same “set aside” remedy for all categories of “agency action,” including agency adjudicative orders and agency rules.  §§551(13), 706(2).  When a federal court concludes that an agency adjudicative order is &nbsp;unlawful, the court must vacate that order.  Around the time when Congress enacted the APA, the phrase “set aside” the agency order meant vacate that order.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>United States</em> v. <em>L. A. Tucker Truck Lines, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"344 U. S. 33\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/344/33\">344 U. S. 33</a>, 38 (1952).  And because federal courts must “set aside” agency rules in the same way that they set aside agency orders, successful challenges to agency rules must award the same remedy.  See M. Sohoni, The Power To Vacate a Rule, 88 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 1121, 1131–1134 (2020).  In short, to “set aside” a rule is to vacate it.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Longstanding precedent reinforces the text.  Over the decades, this Court has affirmed countless decisions that vacated agency actions, including agency rules.  See,<em> e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Department of Homeland Security</em> v. <em>Regents of Univ. of Cal.</em>, <a aria-label=\"591 U. S. 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/591/1\">591 U. S. 1</a>, 36, and n. 7 (2020); <em>Whitman</em> v. <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"531 U. S. 457\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/531/457\">531 U. S. 457</a>, 486 (2001); <em>Board of Governors, FRS</em> v. <em>Dimension Financial Corp.</em>, <a aria-label=\"474 U. S. 361\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/474/361\">474 U. S. 361</a>, 364–365 (1986).  Those decisions vacated the challenged agency rules rather than merely providing injunctive relief that enjoined enforcement of the rules against the specific plaintiffs.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Regents of Univ. of Cal.</em>, 591 U. S., at 9 (holding that the rescission of a major federal program “must be vacated”).  And the D. C. Circuit—which handles the lion’s share of the country’s administrative law cases—has likewise long recognized vacatur as the usual relief when a court holds that agency rules are unlawful.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>National Mining Assn.</em> v. <em>United States Army Corps of Engineers</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/145_F.3d_1399\">145 F. 3d 1399</a>, 1409 (CADC 1998).  In the words of the D. C. Circuit:  “When a reviewing court determines that agency regulations are unlawful, the ordinary result is that the rules are vacated—not that their application to the individual petitioners is proscribed.”  <em>Harmon</em> v. <em>Thornburgh</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/878_F.2d_484\">878 F. 2d 484</a>, 495, n. 21 (CADC 1989). </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Importantly, as Corner Post’s lawsuit shows, the availability of vacatur determines not only the extent of the &nbsp;relief that courts may award in APA suits by <em>regulated</em> parties, but also whether <em>unregulated</em> parties can obtain relief under the APA at all.  In most APA litigation brought by unregulated<em> </em>but adversely affected parties, a plaintiff can obtain relief only through vacatur of the adverse agency action.  Prohibiting courts from vacating agency actions would essentially close the courthouse doors on those unregulated plaintiffs—a radical change to administrative law that would insulate a broad swath of agency actions from any judicial review.<a aria-label=\"reference 3 of Kavanaugh Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_5-3\" id=\"CONCUR_5-3ref\"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Vacatur is therefore essential to fulfill the “basic presumption of judicial review” for parties who have been “adversely affected or aggrieved” by federal agency action.  <em>Abbott Laboratories</em> v. <em>Gardner</em>, <a aria-label=\"387 U. S. 136\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/387/136\">387 U. S. 136</a>, 140 (1967) (quotation marks omitted).  The Court has long applied that “strong presumption” unless there is a “persuasive reason to believe” that Congress intended to bar review of certain actions.  <em>Bowen</em> v. <em>Michigan Academy of Family Physicians</em>, <a aria-label=\"476 U. S. 667\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/476/667\">476 U. S. 667</a>, 670 (1986) (quotation marks omitted); see also, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Weyerhaeuser Co.</em> v. <em>United States Fish and Wildlife Serv.</em>, <a aria-label=\"586 U. S. 9\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/586/9\">586 U. S. 9</a>, 22–23 (2018); <em>Sackett</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, <a aria-label=\"566 U. S. 120\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/566/120\">566 U. S. 120</a>, 128–131 (2012).  Eliminating the vacatur remedy would contravene the strong <em>Abbott Laboratories </em>presumption by insulating many agency rules from meaningful judicial review (which perhaps is the Government’s motivation for its recent campaign).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The absence of vacatur would also create an asymmetry.  For example, without the vacatur remedy, a <em>bank</em> could still challenge the Board’s regulation of interchange fees in a suit for injunctive relief.  The bank might argue that the fee cap is too low and that the Board should be enjoined from enforcing the cap against the bank—a result that would &nbsp;allow the bank to charge higher fees.  But because Corner Post is not subject to the Board’s regulation, it could not contend that the fee cap is too high and that the Board should be enjoined from keeping the cap so high.  So Corner Post would be precluded from suing even though the allegedly unlawful regulation is causing it monetary injury.<a aria-label=\"reference 4 of Kavanaugh Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_5-4\" id=\"CONCUR_5-4ref\"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">III</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Eliminating vacatur as a remedy would terminate entire classes of administrative litigation that have traditionally been brought by unregulated parties.<a aria-label=\"reference 5 of Kavanaugh Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_5-5\" id=\"CONCUR_5-5ref\"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> One example is the wide range of administrative law suits in which businesses target the allegedly unlawful under-regulation of other businesses, such as their &nbsp;competitors.  For example, in <em>National Credit Union Administration</em> v. <em>First National Bank &amp; Trust Co.</em>, several banks challenged the decision of a federal agency to approve a series of amendments to the charter of a federal credit union, a competitor of the banks.  <a aria-label=\"522 U. S. 479\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/522/479\">522 U. S. 479</a>, 484–485 (1998).  The amendments were controversial because they expanded the markets in which the credit union could operate, thereby increasing competition against the banks.  The Court held that the banks could sue under the APA to challenge the agency’s approval of those charter amendments, and also that the agency’s approval of the amendments was unlawful.  Of course, the District Court could remedy the banks’ harm only by vacating the approval of the amendments.  In short, for the plaintiff in <em>First National Bank</em> to have a remedy, the APA must have authorized vacatur.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Those competitor suits are ubiquitous in administrative law.  Some plaintiffs have challenged the favorable classification of a competitor’s drugs or medical products, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>American Bioscience, Inc.</em> v. <em>Thompson</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/269_F.3d_1077\">269 F. 3d 1077</a> (CADC 2001); a research guideline that increased competition for federal grants, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Sherley</em> v. <em>Sebelius</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/610_F.3d_69\">610 F. 3d 69</a> (CADC 2010); and a competitor’s exemption from a generally applicable rule, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Regular Common Carrier Conference</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/793_F.2d_376\">793 F. 2d 376</a> (CADC 1986) (arose under the review provision in <a aria-label=\"28 USC 2342\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2342\">28 U. S. C. §2342</a>).  The Court has consistently held that the plaintiffs incurring those injuries are “adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action” within the meaning of the APA.  <a aria-label=\"5 USC 702\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/702\">5 U. S. C. §702</a>; see <em>First Nat. Bank</em>, 522 U. S., at 488, 499; <em>Investment Company Institute</em> v. <em>Camp</em>, <a aria-label=\"401 U. S. 617\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/401/617\">401 U. S. 617</a>, 618–621 (1971); <em>Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc.</em> v. <em>Camp</em>, <a aria-label=\"397 U. S. 150\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/397/150\">397 U. S. 150</a>, 157 (1970).  But such competitor suits would be largely if not entirely eradicated if the APA and similar statutory review provisions did not authorize vacatur.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; Suits where one business challenges the under-regulation of another go well beyond competitor suits.  One example is the Court’s landmark decision in <em>Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of United States, Inc.</em> v. <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"463 U.S. 29\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/463/29\">463 U. S. 29 (1983)</a>.  That case arose when several insurance companies challenged a federal agency’s rescission of safety standards for new motor vehicles.  The Court held that the agency’s decision to rescind those safety standards was subject to the same degree of judicial review as the decision to issue the standards in the first place.  See <em>id</em>., at 40–44.  The Court also concluded that the rescission of the safety standards was arbitrary and capricious.  See <em>id</em>., at 44–57.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> At no point in that landmark opinion on the judicial review of agency actions did the Court state (or need to state) the obvious:  Because the agency did not regulate the insurers themselves, the insurers could obtain relief from the downstream effects of the agency’s rescission of the safety standards only if the insurers could obtain vacatur of that rescission.  The Court did not dwell on that remedial point because the availability of vacatur was presumably obvious to all involved.  Only now—some 40 years later—does the Government imply that the premise of <em>State Farm </em>was mistaken.  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Government’s new position would also largely eliminate the common form of environmental litigation where private citizens sue a federal agency based on the externalities that an agency action is likely to produce.  Litigation often arises when a federal agency approves a development project with potential effects on the environment or on other property owners.  Examples include the construction of a new pipeline, see <em>Delaware Riverkeeper Network </em>v. <em>FERC</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/753_F.3d_1304\">753 F. 3d 1304</a> (CADC 2014), or the mining of federal land, see <em>WildEarth Guardians</em> v. <em>Jewell</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/738_F.3d_298\">738 F. 3d 298</a> (CADC 2013).  In those cases, the plaintiff generally cannot bring an APA suit &nbsp;against the developer, who is usually a private party.  See §704 (authorizing review of “agency action”).  Instead, the plaintiff typically sues the federal agency that approved the development and asks a federal court to vacate that approval.  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Some of those suits proceed under the APA; others proceed under federal statutory review provisions that similarly authorize courts to “set aside” agency action.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <a aria-label=\"15 USC 717r b\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/717r#b\">15 U. S. C. §717r(b)</a> (Natural Gas Act); <a aria-label=\"16 USC 825\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/825\">16 U. S. C. §825</a><em>l</em>(b) (Federal Power Act).  Regardless, all of those suits depend on the availability of vacatur.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Many APA suits similarly challenge federal emissions limits or efficiency standards for cars, trucks, and other sources of pollution.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>American Public Gas Assn.</em> v. <em>Department of Energy</em>, 72 F. 4th 1324 (CADC 2023).  When a plaintiff alleges that an emissions limit does too little to stop third parties from polluting the environment, the plaintiff cannot bring an APA suit against the third party.  Rather, the plaintiff must sue the agency that enacted the emissions limit.  If the vacatur remedy were unavailable, the agency that enacted the emissions limit would never face litigation from unregulated parties seeking stricter limits; the agency could face litigation only from regulated parties seeking looser limits.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Workers and their unions also regularly challenge agency rules that rescind or loosen federal workplace safety standards.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Transportation Div. of Int’l Assn. of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail, and Transp. Workers</em> v. <em>Federal Railroad Admin.</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/988_F.3d_1170\">988 F. 3d 1170</a> (CA9 2021) (railroad industry); <em>United Steel</em> v. <em>Mine Safety and Health Admin.</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/925_F.3d_1279\">925 F. 3d 1279</a> (CADC 2019) (mining industry).  Those suits often arise under statutory review provisions that, like the APA, authorize courts to “set aside” agency actions.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <a aria-label=\"28 USC 2342 7\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2342#7\">28 U. S. C. §2342(7)</a> (railroad industry); <a aria-label=\"30 USC 816 a 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/30/816#a_1\">30 U. S. C. §816(a)(1)</a> (mining industry).  And the suits all depend on the availability of vacatur as a remedy.  In particular, the &nbsp;workers may prevail in those suits only through vacatur of the agency rules.  So if “set aside” did not mean vacate, workplace safety rules could be challenged from only one direction—by employers who want less regulation, not by workers who want more regulation.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The examples of standard agency litigation that depend on the availability of vacatur are seemingly endless.  Vacatur was essential when American workers challenged a Department of Labor rule that unlawfully allowed employers to access inexpensive foreign labor, with the effect of lowering American workers’ wages.  See <em>Mendoza</em> v. <em>Perez</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/754_F.3d_1002\">754 F. 3d 1002</a> (CADC 2014).  Vacatur was essential when a county challenged the Department of the Interior’s allowance for Indian gaming on nearby land.  See <em>Butte Cty.</em> v. <em>Hogen</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/613_F.3d_190\">613 F. 3d 190</a> (CADC 2010).  Vacatur is often essential when a State challenges an agency action that does not regulate the State directly but has adverse downstream effects on the State.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Department of Commerce</em> v. <em>New York</em>, <a aria-label=\"588 U.S. 752\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/588/752\">588 U. S. 752 (2019)</a>.<a aria-label=\"reference 6 of Kavanaugh Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_5-6\" id=\"CONCUR_5-6ref\"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> I will stop there.  But to be clear, I could go on all day (and then some) listing cases where vacatur was necessary for an unregulated but adversely affected plaintiff in an &nbsp;APA suit to obtain relief.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">IV</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Against all of that text, history, precedent, and common sense, the Government has recently rejected the straightforward and long-accepted conclusion that the phrase “set aside” in the APA authorizes vacatur.  Instead, the Government contends that plaintiffs harmed by agency rules must seek injunctions against enforcement of those rules.  See Brief for United States in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, O. T. 2022, No. 22–58, pp. 40–44.  One effect of the Government’s new position would be to insulate many agency rules from meaningful judicial review in suits by unregulated but adversely affected parties.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> To support its new position, the Government has offered an array of arguments.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>First</em>, the Government says that vacatur of a federal rule is akin to a nationwide injunction—in other words, an injunction that prohibits the Government from enforcing a law against <em>anyone</em>, not just the parties in a specific case.  The Government has contended that equitable relief is ordinarily limited to the parties in a specific case.  Therefore, nationwide injunctions would be permissible only if Congress authorized them.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> But in the APA, Congress did in fact depart from that baseline and authorize vacatur.  As noted above, the text of the APA expressly authorizes federal courts to “set aside” agency action.  <a aria-label=\"5 USC 706 2\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/706#2\">5 U. S. C. §706(2)</a>.  “Unlike judicial review of statutes, in which courts enter judgments and decrees only against litigants, the APA” and related statutory review provisions “go further by empowering the judiciary to act directly against the challenged agency action.”  J. Mitchell, The Writ-of-Erasure Fallacy, 104 Va. L. Rev. 933, 1012 (2018).  The text of §706(2) directs federal courts to vacate agency actions in the same way that appellate courts vacate the judgments of trial courts.  See M. Sohoni, The &nbsp;Power To Vacate a Rule, 88 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 1121, 1131–1134 (2020).  The text of the APA therefore authorizes vacatur of agency rules.  By contrast, Congress has rarely authorized courts to act directly on federal statutes or to prohibit their enforcement against nonparties.  As a result, background equitable principles may control in those non-APA cases.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Second</em>, the Government argues that the remedies available in APA suits are not governed by §706(2), which directs courts to “set aside” agency action, but instead are governed by §703.  That argument is weak.  Section 703 determines the “form of proceeding” for suits under the APA and identifies the federal actors against whom an “action for judicial review may be brought.”<a aria-label=\"reference 7 of Kavanaugh Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_5-7\" id=\"CONCUR_5-7ref\"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup></a>  But “no court has ever held that Section 703 implicitly delimits the kinds of remedies available in an APA suit.”  M. Sohoni, The Past and Future of Universal Vacatur, 133 Yale L. J. 2305, 2337 (2024).  For good reason:  As explained above, the ordinary meaning of “set aside” in §706(2) has long been understood to refer to the remedy of vacatur.  The conclusion that §706 governs remedies is also supported by §706(1), which authorizes courts to “compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed”—unmistakably a remedy.  By contrast, the text of §703 “speaks to venue and forms of proceedings, not to remedies, and regardless, its &nbsp;listing of the available forms of proceedings is nonexhaustive.”  Sohoni, The Past and Future of Universal Vacatur, 133 Yale L. J., at 2337.  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> To support its novel reliance on §703, the Government suggests that the phrase “set aside” in §706(2) may refer to a “rule of decision directing the reviewing court to disregard unlawful” agency actions in “resolving the case before it,” rather than the remedy of vacatur.  Brief for United States in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, O. T. 2022, No. 22–58, at 40.  But the leading cases and legal dictionaries at the time of the APA’s enactment did not use “set aside” in that manner.  They instead referred to setting aside (that is, vacating) judgments—a meaning entirely consistent with the APA’s authorization to vacate agency actions.  See <em>supra</em>, at 5.  The Government’s position instead relies on some colloquial uses of the phrase “set aside” in federal constitutional challenges to state statutes.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., Brief for United States in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, O. T. 2022, No. 22–58, at 41 (citing <em>Mallinckrodt Chemical Works</em> v. <em>Missouri ex rel. Jones</em>, <a aria-label=\"238 U. S. 41\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/238/41\">238 U. S. 41</a>, 54 (1915)); see also <em>Mallinckrodt</em>, 238 U. S., at 54 (referring to “one who seeks to set aside a state statute as repugnant to the Federal Constitution”).  That is a thin basis for suddenly prohibiting entire categories of long-common administrative litigation.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Third</em>, the Government seizes on legislative history to argue that Congress did not expect the APA to create new remedies against unlawful agency actions.  But vacatur was not a new remedy.  On the contrary, several pre-APA statutes authorized courts to “set aside” specific kinds of agency actions, such as orders by the Interstate Commerce Commission.  See n. 2, <em>supra</em>.  This Court correctly understood those statutes to authorize vacatur.  For example, in litigation regarding the regulation of railroads, this Court held that an unlawful ICC order was “void.”  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co.</em>,<em> </em><a aria-label=\"293 U. S. 454\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/293/454\">293 U. S. 454</a>, 464 (1935).  Similar examples abound.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., Sohoni, The &nbsp;Past and Future of Universal Vacatur, 133 Yale L. J., at 2329–2335 (collecting cases).  By similarly authorizing courts to “set aside” agency actions, the APA likewise authorized vacatur.  §706(2).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Moreover, although vacatur was not as common in the years surrounding the APA’s enactment, there is a simple explanation for that:  Courts had few occasions to set aside agency rules before this Court’s 1967 decision in <em>Abbott Laboratories</em> v. <em>Gardner</em>, which significantly expanded the opportunities for facial, pre-enforcement review of agency rules.  <a aria-label=\"387 U. S. 136\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/387/136\">387 U. S. 136</a>, 139–141.  Indeed, it was not until <em>Abbott Laboratories</em> that “preenforcement review of agency rules” became “the norm, not the exception.”  S. Breyer &amp; R. Stewart, Administrative Law and Regulatory Policy 1137 (2d ed. 1985).  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Government’s current position on vacatur would <em>de facto</em> overrule <em>Abbott Laboratories </em>as to suits by unregulated parties.  Not surprisingly, the Government’s current position on vacatur sounds very similar to Justice Fortas’ dissent in a companion case to <em>Abbott Laboratories</em>, where he lamented that in the wake of those decisions, a court would be able to “suspend the operation of regulations in their entirety.”  <em>Gardner</em> v. <em>Toilet Goods Assn., Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"387 U. S. 167\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/387/167\">387 U. S. 167</a>, 175 (1967).  In any event, to the extent that the Government worries that vacatur of rules (as opposed to orders) is more common today than it was in the 1950s, the Government’s true grievance is with <em>Abbott Laboratories</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Fourth</em>, the Government objects to the real-world consequences that occur when a federal district court wrongly vacates a lawful rule.  I appreciate that concern.  But federal law already gives the Government tools to mitigate those consequences—if not avoid them altogether.  When the Government believes that a district court has erroneously vacated a rule (or erroneously issued a preliminary injunction against a rule), the Government may promptly seek a stay in the relevant federal court of &nbsp;appeals.  To determine whether to grant a stay, the court of appeals may then promptly review the Government’s likelihood of success on the merits, among other factors.  If the court of appeals denies a stay, the Government may seek further review in this Court.  See <em>Labrador</em> v. <em>Poe</em>, 601 U. S. ___, ___ (2024) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Kavanaugh</span>, J., concurring in grant of stay) (slip op., at 2).  The Government’s frustration with the occasional incorrect district court vacatur of an agency rule is understandable.  But especially given the readily accessible and regularly utilized procedures for staying a district court’s vacatur,<a aria-label=\"reference 8 of Kavanaugh Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_5-8\" id=\"CONCUR_5-8ref\"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup></a> we should not overreact by entirely gutting vacatur as a remedy and thereby barring unregulated but adversely affected parties from bringing APA suits.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Not surprisingly, when asked at oral argument in this case about the extraordinary consequences of its new no-vacatur position, the Government seemed to backpedal and hedge a bit.  The Government suggested that vacatur may actually still be appropriate if it is “the only way to give the party before the court relief.”  Tr. of Oral Arg. 76.  The Government also said that “it’s possible that the only way to provide” Corner Post “relief would be vacatur.”  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> I appreciate the Government’s apparent attempt to back away from its extreme stance.  But in doing so, the Government also revealed the weakness of its position.  The meaning of “set aside” in the APA cannot reasonably depend on the specific party before the court.  Either the APA authorizes vacatur, or it does not.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> More to the point, the Government’s answer at oral argument is a solution in search of a problem.  The federal courts have long interpreted the APA to authorize vacatur of agency actions.  Both the text and the history of the APA support that interpretation, and courts have had no real &nbsp;difficulty applying the remedy in practice.  Some 78 years after the APA and 57 years after <em>Abbott Laboratories</em>, I would not suddenly throw out that sound and settled interpretation of the APA and eliminate entire classes of historically common and vitally important litigation against federal agencies.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">*  *  *</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The Government’s crusade against vacatur would create “strange and even absurd consequences.”  Sohoni, The Past and Future of Universal Vacatur, 133 Yale L. J., at 2340.  In this opinion, I have described one such consequence:  It would leave unregulated plaintiffs like Corner Post without a remedy in APA challenges to agency rules.  The Government’s position therefore would fundamentally reshape administrative law, leaving administrative agencies with extraordinary new power to issue rules free from potential suits by unregulated but adversely affected parties—businesses, environmental plaintiffs, workers, the list goes on.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> I agree with the longstanding consensus—a consensus based on text, history, precedent, and common sense—that vacatur is an appropriate remedy when a federal court holds that an agency rule is unlawful.  Because vacatur remains an available remedy under the APA, Corner Post can obtain meaningful relief if it prevails in this lawsuit.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<h3 class=\"fnheader\">Notes</h3>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"CONCUR_5-1\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Kavanaugh Concurrence at reference 1\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#CONCUR_5-1ref\">1</a>  A plaintiff could not challenge the fee rule by suing to “compel agency action” that is “unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.”  <a aria-label=\"5 USC 706 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/706#1\">5 U. S. C. §706(1)</a>.  The remedy of compelling agency action applies if an agency fails to issue a required rule.  But here, the Board issued a rule, and the question is whether the rule set a reasonable fee cap.  It would therefore make little sense to say that the fee rule has been “withheld” or “delayed.”  Indeed, it seems that §706(1) has almost never been used to challenge extant agency rules, as opposed to challenging the absence of required rules.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"CONCUR_5-2\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Kavanaugh Concurrence at reference 2\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#CONCUR_5-2ref\">2</a>  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Hepburn Act of 1906, ch. 3591, §5, <a href=\"/rio/citation/34_Stat._584\">34 Stat. 584</a>, 592 (courts could “enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend any order or requirement of ” the Interstate Commerce Commission); Securities Exchange Act of 1934, ch. 404, §25(a), <a href=\"/rio/citation/48_Stat._881\">48 Stat. 881</a>, 902 (authorizing courts “to affirm, modify, and enforce or set aside [an] order” of the SEC); Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938, ch. 675, §701(f )(3), <a href=\"/rio/citation/52_Stat._1040\">52 Stat. 1040</a>, 1055–1056 (authorizing a court to “affirm the order” of the FDA, “or to set it aside in whole or in part, temporarily or permanently”).</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"CONCUR_5-3\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Kavanaugh Concurrence at reference 3\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#CONCUR_5-3ref\">3</a>  Most of the recent academic and judicial discussion of this issue has addressed suits by regulated parties.  That discussion has largely missed a major piece of the issue—suits by unregulated but adversely affected parties.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"CONCUR_5-4\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Kavanaugh Concurrence at reference 4\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#CONCUR_5-4ref\">4</a>  Absent vacatur, the remedy for a <em>regulated</em> plaintiff would not automatically extend to other regulated parties.  For example, if a district court issued an injunction that prevents the Board from enforcing the fee rule against one bank, the Board would still be able to enforce the fee rule against other banks.  For those other banks to obtain the same relief, they would need to either (i) file similar APA suits and request similar injunctions or (ii) wait and see if the fee rule is temporarily enjoined or held unlawful by either the relevant court of appeals or this Court.  In that respect, eliminating the vacatur remedy would delay relief for many regulated parties.  That said, in light of vertical <em>stare decisis</em>, the consequences for regulated parties of eliminating vacatur would not be as severe as the consequences for unregulated parties.  See <em>Labrador</em> v. <em>Poe</em>, 601 U. S. ___, ___ (2024) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Kavanaugh</span>, J., concurring in grant of stay) (slip op., at 8–9); cf. W. Baude &amp; S. Bray, Proper Parties, Proper Relief, 137 Harv. L. Rev. 153, 183 (2023) (when the Supreme Court “holds a statute to be unconstitutional or a rule to be unlawful, it may be <em>as good as</em> vacated”).</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"CONCUR_5-5\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Kavanaugh Concurrence at reference 5\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#CONCUR_5-5ref\">5</a>  This opinion focuses primarily on administrative litigation that arises under the APA.  But Congress has also enacted special statutory review provisions that similarly authorize federal courts to “set aside” specific agency actions.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <a aria-label=\"15 USC 78y a\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/78y#a\">15 U. S.

C. §2342</a> (the FCC, the Atomic Energy Commission, and other agencies).  By arguing that the APA’s use of “set aside” does not authorize vacatur, the Government implies that vacatur is also unavailable under those similar review provisions.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"CONCUR_5-6\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Kavanaugh Concurrence at reference 6\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#CONCUR_5-6ref\">6</a>  In some circumstances, usually when a court rules that an agency must provide additional explanation for the challenged agency action or must regulate some entity or activity <em>more</em> extensively, some courts have remanded to the agency without vacatur.  Remand without vacatur is essentially a shorthand way of vacating a rule and staying the vacatur pending the agency’s completion of an additional required action, such as providing additional explanation or issuing a new, more stringent rule.  I do not address that practice here, which has been the subject of some debate.  See <em>Checkosky</em> v. <em>SEC</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/23_F.3d_452\">23 F. 3d 452</a>, 462–465 (CADC 1994) (Silberman, J.) (explaining the practice); see also <em>id</em>., at 493, n. 37 (Randolph, J.) (noting that courts and parties alternatively may avoid any “difficulties” associated with vacatur by “a stay of the mandate”).  Importantly for present purposes, the view that vacatur is “<em>authorized</em> by the APA is a basic proposition shared by <em>both</em> sides of the debate over remand without vacatur.”  M. Sohoni, The Power To Vacate a Rule, 88 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 1121, 1178 (2020).</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"CONCUR_5-7\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Kavanaugh Concurrence at reference 7\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#CONCUR_5-7ref\">7</a>  Section 703 states:  “The form of proceeding for judicial review is the special statutory review proceeding relevant to the subject matter in a court specified by statute or, in the absence or inadequacy thereof, any applicable form of legal action, including actions for declaratory judgments or writs of prohibitory or mandatory injunction or habeas corpus, in a court of competent jurisdiction.  If no special statutory review proceeding is applicable, the action for judicial review may be brought against the United States, the agency by its official title, or the appropriate officer.

S. 503\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/386/503\">386 U. S. 503</a>, 517 (1967).  Today, the majority throws that caution to the wind and engages in the same kind of misguided reasoning about statutory limitations periods that we have previously admonished.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The flawed reasoning and far-reaching results of the Court’s ruling in this case are staggering.  First, the reasoning. The text and context of the relevant statutory provisions plainly reveal that, for facial challenges to agency regulations, the 6-year limitations period in <a aria-label=\"28 USC 2401 a\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2401#a\">28 U. S. C. §2401(a)</a> starts running when the rule is published.  The Court says otherwise today, holding that the broad statutory term “accrues” requires us to conclude that the limitations period for Administrative Procedure Act (APA) claims runs from the time of a plaintiff ’s injury.  Never mind that this Court’s precedents tell us that the meaning of “accrues” is context specific.  Never mind that, in the administrative-law context, limitations statutes uniformly run from the &nbsp;moment of agency action.  Never mind that a plaintiff ’s injury is utterly irrelevant to a facial APA claim.  According to the Court, we must ignore all of this because, for other kinds of claims, accrual begins at the time of a plaintiff ’s injury.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Next, the results.  The Court’s baseless conclusion means that there is effectively no longer any limitations period for lawsuits that challenge agency regulations on their face.  Allowing every new commercial entity to bring fresh facial challenges to long-existing regulations is profoundly destabilizing for both Government and businesses.  It also allows well-heeled litigants to game the system by creating new entities or finding new plaintiffs whenever they blow past the statutory deadline.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The majority refuses to accept the straightforward, commonsense, and singularly plausible reading of the limitations statute that Congress wrote.  In doing so, the Court wreaks havoc on Government agencies, businesses, and society at large.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">I</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> When a claim accrues depends on the nature of the claim.  See <em>Crown Coat</em>, 386 U. S., at 517.  So, understanding the context in which <em>these</em> claims arose is essential to determining when Congress meant for them to accrue.  The facts of this very case illustrate the absurdity of the majority’s one-size-fits-all approach.  The procedural history is also a prime example of the gamesmanship that statutory limitations periods are enacted to prevent.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">A</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Start with the relevant agency regulation.  In 2010, Congress required the Federal Reserve Board to issue rules for debit-card transaction fees.  See <a aria-label=\"15 USC 1693\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1693\">15 U. S. C. §1693</a><em>o</em>–2(a)(1).  The Board did as Congress instructed.  As relevant here, in &nbsp;2011, the Board issued Regulation II, capping debit-card interchange fees at 21 cents per transaction plus 0.05 percent of the transaction.  <a aria-label=\"76 FR 43420\" href=\"/rio/citation/76_FR_43420\">76 Fed. Reg. 43420</a> (2011) (codified at <a aria-label=\"12 CFR\" href=\"/cfr/text/12\">12</a> CFR §253.3(b) (2022)).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> As often happens, affected parties challenged Regulation II almost immediately after the Board issued it  Several large trade groups sued under the APA, alleging that Regulation II was, in several respects, arbitrary, capricious, and not in accordance with law.  <em>NACS </em>v. <em>Board of Governors of FRS</em>, 958 F. Supp. 2d 85, 95–96 (DC 2013).<em> </em>Ultimately, the D. C. Circuit rejected that challenge in relevant part.  <em>NACS</em> v. <em>Board of Governors of FRS</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/746_F.3d_474\">746 F. 3d 474</a>, 477 (2014).<em> </em>And, a few months after that, we denied certiorari.  See <a aria-label=\"574 U.S. 1121\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/574/1121\">574 U. S. 1121 (2015)</a>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Now consider the facts of this challenge.  In the majority’s telling, this is about a single “truckstop and convenience store located in Watford City, North Dakota.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 1.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Not quite.  Rather, two large trade groups initially filed this action in 2021—a full decade after the Federal Reserve Board finalized the debit-card-fee regulations at issue.  Those groups were the North Dakota Petroleum Marketers Association, a “trade association that has existed since the mid-1950s,” and the North Dakota Retail Association, another trade group.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 53.  Corner Post<em>, </em>which had only opened its doors in 2018, was not a party to the trade groups’ initial complaint.  The Government moved to dismiss the pleading, invoking §2401(a)’s 6-year statute of limitations.  In response, the trade groups sought leave to amend.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> It was only then that Corner Post was added as a plaintiff.  And, importantly, other than the addition of Corner Post, the trade groups’ complaint remained practically identical to the untimely one they had filed before.  Other than a few changes of phrasing and some newly available &nbsp;2019 data, the amended complaint alleged the same facts and sought the same relief as the original pleading.  It also included the exact same legal claims—verbatim.  The only material change to the amended complaint was the addition of Corner Post.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Thus, even before I analyze the statute of limitations arguments, one can see that this case is the poster child for the type of manipulation that the majority now invites—new groups being brought in (or created) just to do an end run around the statute of limitations.<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Jackson Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-1\" id=\"DISSENT_6-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a>  To repeat: The claims in Corner Post’s lawsuit were not new or in any way distinct (even in wording) from the pre-existing and untimely claims of the trade organizations that had been around for decades.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This time, however, when the Government renewed its motion to dismiss, the plaintiffs made the case all about Corner Post.  The plaintiffs argued that, because Corner Post had not yet formed as a company when the Board issued Regulation II, it simply could not be subjected to a 6-year limitations period that ran from when the challenged regulation issued back in 2011.  (One wonders how a company that formed against the backdrop of a long-settled rule could possibly be entitled to complain, or claim injury, related to the regulatory environment in which it willingly entered—but I digress.)  Rather than accepting that the untimely challenge remained so, Corner Post demanded a personalized, plaintiff-specific limitations rule, giving an entity six years from when <em>it </em>was first affected by a &nbsp;Government action to file a facial challenge.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The District Court rejected Corner Post’s argument, following the lead of every court of appeals that had ever addressed accrual of an APA facial challenge.<a aria-label=\"reference 2 of Jackson Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-2\" id=\"DISSENT_6-2ref\"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a>  It held that the addition of Corner Post as a plaintiff did not make a difference to the timeliness of the business groups’ claims.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed, holding that “when plaintiffs bring a facial challenge to a final agency action, the right of action accrues, and the limitations period begins to run, upon publication of the regulation.”  <em>North Dakota Retail Assn.</em> v. <em>Board of Governors of FRS</em>, 55 F. 4th 634, 641 (2022).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">II</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> But here we are.  Three-quarters of a century after Congress enacted the APA, a majority of this Court rejects the consensus view that, for facial challenges to agency rules, the statutory 6-year limitations period runs from the publication of the rule.  Instead, it holds that an APA claim accrues “when the plaintiff is injured by final agency action.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 1.  The majority maintains that the text of §2401(a) demands this result.  But if that answer is so obvious, one wonders why no court proclaimed it until more than 75 years after all the statutory pieces were in place.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> To explain how the majority got this ruling wrong, I find it necessary to provide the right answer.  Here, the relevant &nbsp;statutory text is the catchall limitations provision for suits brought against the United States: §2401(a) of Title 28 of the United States Code.  All agree that there are two key terms in that provision—“accrues” and “the right of action.”  <em>Ibid.  </em>The majority misreads both.  Contrary to the Court’s rigid reading, the word “accrues” lacks any fixed meaning.  See <em>Crown Coat</em>, 386 U. S., at 517.  Instead, the meaning of accrue for the purpose of a statute of limitations is determined by the particular “right of action” at issue.  For many kinds of legal claims, accrual is plaintiff specific because the claims themselves are plaintiff specific.  But facial administrative-law claims are not.  This means that, in the administrative-law context, the limitations period begins not when a plaintiff is injured, but when a rule is finalized.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">A</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> When sovereign immunity has been waived, the Federal Government is often sued, and Congress has enacted statutes of limitations to ensure that those lawsuits are brought in a timely fashion.  Because such suits arise in different contexts, Congress has enacted different statutes of limitations for different types of suits.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Most statutes of limitations are context specific.  For example, a tort claim against the United States typically must be brought “within two years after such claim accrues.” <a aria-label=\"28 USC 2401 b\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2401#b\">28 U. S. C. §2401(b)</a>.  By contrast, a party challenging certain administrative orders must seek review “within 60 days after [the order’s] entry.”  §2344.  Many more examples of context-specific limitations periods in the U. S. Code abound.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., §2501 (claims over which the United States Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction must be brought within six years); <a aria-label=\"33 USC 1369 b 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/33/1369#b_1\">33 U. S. C. §1369(b)(1)</a> (challenges to certain standards adopted by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Clean Water Act must commence “within 120 days from the date of . . . promulgation”).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; The statute at issue here—<a aria-label=\"28 USC 2401 a\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2401#a\">28 U. S. C. §2401(a)</a>—supplements those specific provisions.  In doing so, §2401(a) serves a special purpose: to act as a catchall that imposes an outer time limit on claims brought against the United States when no other statute of limitations applies.  Under §2401(a), “every civil action commenced against the United States shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years after the right of action first accrues.”  This catchall limitations statute has been applied in a range of contexts, including APA claims (like this one), contract claims, see <em>Crown Coat</em>, 386 U. S., at 510–511, and more, see, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Natural Resources Defense Council </em>v.<em> Haaland</em>,<em> </em>102 F. 4th 1045, 1074 (CA9 2024) (claims under the Endangered Species Act).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Consistent with the broad scope of its potential application, §2401(a) uses broad language.  It starts the 6-year clock when “the right of action first accrues.”  §2401(a).  No more elaboration or specificity is given.  So, what <em>does</em> the sparse text of §2401(a) tell us?  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> To start, the statute tells us to look at when “the right of action <em>first</em> accrues.”  (Emphasis added.)  The word “first” directs us to start the clock at the earliest possible opportunity once the claim accrues.  From the text alone, then, we know that this moment in time should happen sooner rather than later.  But <em>when</em> that moment occurs depends on the meaning of both “the right of action” and “accrues.”</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Next, the provision uses the unadorned phrase “the right of action.”  Because this statute is applicable to a broad range of causes of action against the Government, the underlying statute (here the APA) provides “the right of action,” not §2401(a) itself.  Put another way, the §2401(a) catchall applies to different causes of action, and those causes of action establish different legal claims. Though the right of action is not the same for an APA claim as it is for an Endangered Species Act claim, §2401(a)’s broad “right of action” language applies to both of these claims, and more.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">&nbsp;B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> A proper understanding of the word “accrues” makes clear that this term is far more flexible and context dependent than the majority appreciates.  Crucially, the Court has said this very thing before—more than once, in fact.  We have long understood that it is simply not “possible to assign the word ‘accrued’ any definite technical meaning which by itself would enable us to say whether the statutory period begins to run at one time or the other.”  <em>Reading Co. </em>v.<em> Koons</em>, <a aria-label=\"271 U. S. 58\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/271/58\">271 U. S. 58</a>, 61–62 (1926); see also <em>Crown Coat</em>, 386 U. S., at 517 (recognizing “the hazards inherent in attempting to define for all purposes when a ‘cause of action’ first ‘accrues’ ”).  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> But, for some reason, that does not stop the majority from trying here.  Its opinion repeatedly asserts that the ordinary meaning of accrual is that claims accrue only when a plaintiff can sue.  See <em>ante,</em> at 6–10.<a aria-label=\"reference 3 of Jackson Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-3\" id=\"DISSENT_6-3ref\"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></a>  But even the majority acknowledges that its preferred definition of accrual is not universal; it is, at most, “the ‘<em>standard</em> rule’ ” that “can be displaced.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 8 (quoting<em> Green</em> v. <em>Brennan</em>, <a aria-label=\"578 U. S. 547\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/578/547\">578 U. S. 547</a>, 554 (2016); emphasis added).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Far from imposing a one-size-fits-all definition of the word “accrue,” this Court has traditionally taken a claim-specific view: “[A] right accrues when it comes into existence. ”  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Lindsay</em>, <a aria-label=\"346 U. S. 568\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/346/568\">346 U. S. 568</a>, 569 (1954).  For example, in <em>McMahon</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"342 U.S. 25\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/342/25\">342 U. S. 25 (1951)</a>, we held that, under the Suits in Admiralty Act, a claim accrued when a seaman was injured, even though he could not yet sue at that time.  See <em>id</em>., at 27–28.  In <em>Crown Coat</em>, we held the opposite—a claim brought under <a aria-label=\"28 USC 1346\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1346\">28 U. S. C. §1346</a> did not accrue at the time of injury, but rather at the moment of final administrative action, because a plaintiff could not sue until the agency action was final.  See 386 U. S., at 513–514, 517–518.  The point is <em>not</em> that these cases all point in one direction or the other with respect to the meaning of accrue.  Instead, our cases illustrate what this Court has expressly stated:  The term “accrued” lacks “any definite technical meaning,” <em>Reading</em>, 271 U. S., at 61.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The majority nevertheless decrees today that accrual must always be plaintiff specific—<em>i.e., </em>that a claim cannot accrue until “this particular plaintiff ” can bring suit.  <em>Ante,</em> at 14.  But that is not what §2401(a) says.  It does not say that the clock starts when <em>the plaintiff ’s</em> right of action first accrues; rather, §2401(a) starts the clock when “<em>the</em> right of action first accrues.”  (Emphasis added.)  In other words, the limitations provision here focuses on the claim being brought without regard for who brings it.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The dictionary definitions on which the majority relies further highlight this important observation.  A claim accrues, according to those definitions, “ ‘when <em>a</em> suit may be maintained thereon’ ” or upon the “ ‘coming or springing into existence of <em>a</em> right to sue.’ ”  <em>Ante,</em> at 7 (emphasis added) (first quoting Black’s Law Dictionary 37 (4th ed. 1951), then quoting Ballentine’s Law Dictionary 15–16 (2d ed. 1948)).  Again, and notably, these dictionaries speak of <em>a </em>right to sue, not <em>the plaintiff ’s</em> right to sue.  Like §2401(a) itself, these definitions do not support the majority’s assertion that accrual is necessarily plaintiff specific.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Of course, many of our cases <em>do </em>say that a claim accrues when “ ‘the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action.’ ”  <em>E</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Gabelli</em> v. <em>SEC</em>, <a aria-label=\"568 U. S. 442\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/568/442\">568 U. S. 442</a>, 448 (2013); <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Kato</em>, <a aria-label=\"549 U. S. 384\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/549/384\">549 U. S. 384</a>, 388 (2007); <em>Graham County Soil &amp; Water Conservation Dist.</em> v. <em>United States ex rel. Wilson</em>, <a aria-label=\"545 U. S. 409\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/545/409\">545 U. S. 409</a>, 418 (2005); <em>Bay Area Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund</em> v. <em>Ferbar Corp. of Cal.</em>, <a aria-label=\"522 U. S. 192\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/522/192\">522 U. S. 192</a>, 201 (1997).  But those statements were made in the context of particular cases, each of which dealt with plaintiff-specific causes of action.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Gabelli</em>, 568 U. S., at 446 (civil enforcement claim by the Securities and Exchange Commission); <em>Wallace</em>, 549 U. S., at 388 (false imprisonment and arrest claims);<em> Graham County</em>, 545 U. S., at 412 (retaliation claim against an employer); <em>Bay Area Laundry</em>, 522 U. S., at 195 (claim alleging failure to make required payments to employee pension funds).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Here is what I mean by this.  When a complaint brought against a defendant asserts, “You falsely imprisoned me,” or “You retaliated against me,” it is making a legal claim that is specific to the particular plaintiff.  But, as discussed below, it is not similarly plaintiff specific to bring a claim saying, for example, that a particular regulation is invalid because it “exceeds the Board’s statutory authority,” or because the Government “failed to consider important aspects of the problem,” as the complaint here alleges.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 80, 82.  So, while accrual may sometimes—even usually—be plaintiff specific, that is just because underlying legal claims are often plaintiff specific.  The precedents the majority cites never say otherwise; <em>i</em>.<em>e</em>., they do not tell us that accrual must <em>always</em> be plaintiff specific.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The majority’s other hard-and-fast distinction—between statutes of limitations and statutes of repose—fares no better.  See <em>ante,</em> at 9–10.  The majority sets up a dichotomy: Statutes of limitations are plaintiff-centric rules that “ ‘require plaintiffs to pursue diligent prosecution of known claims,’ ” while statutes of repose emphasize finality and are tied to “ ‘the last culpable act or omission of the defendant.’ ”  <em>Ante,</em> at 9 (quoting <em>CTS Corp.</em> v. <em>Waldburger</em>, <a aria-label=\"573 U. S. 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/573/1\">573 U. S. 1</a>, 8 (2014)).  The problem is that statutes of limitations and statutes of repose, while different, are not nearly as different as the majority imagines.  It is true that statutes of repose are considered to be “defendant-protective.” <em>Ante,</em> at 10.  But the same is true of statutes of limitations.  “The very purpose of a period of limitation is that there may be, at some definitely ascertainable period, an end to litigation.”  <em>Reading</em>, 271 U. S., at 65; see also <em>Gabelli</em>, 568 U. S., at 448 (repose is a “ ‘basic polic[y] of all limitations provisions’ ”).  In fact, according to one of the dictionaries the majority cites, “[s]tatutes of limitation <em>are</em> statutes of repose.”  Black’s Law Dictionary, at 1077 (emphasis added).  The difference is that unlike statutes of repose, statutes of limitations have more than one purpose:  they bring finality for defendants <em>and</em> prevent plaintiffs from sleeping on their rights.  Understanding these dual functions sheds no light whatsoever on what to do when those competing purposes point in different directions.<a aria-label=\"reference 4 of Jackson Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-4\" id=\"DISSENT_6-4ref\"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">III</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Because different claims accrue at different times, we must look to the specific types of claims that the plaintiffs have brought and consider the context in which the limitations period operates.  “Cases under [one statute] do not necessarily rule . . . claims” brought under another.  <em>Crown Coat</em>, 386 U. S., at 517.  And our understanding of accrual for limitations purposes has always been context specific.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Wallace</em>, 549 U. S., at 389 (relying on torts treatises to explain the “distinctive rule” for commencement of limitations period for false imprisonment suits); <em>Franconia Associates</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"536 U. S. 129\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/536/129\">536 U. S. 129</a>, 142–144 (2002) (citing contracts treatises to explain that contract claims accrue at the moment of breach); <em>Merck &amp; Co.</em> v. <em>Reynolds</em>, &nbsp;<a aria-label=\"559 U. S. 633\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/559/633\">559 U. S. 633</a>, 644–646 (2010) (applying fraud-specific discovery rule to determine accrual).  In other words, to understand when “the right of action” accrues under §2401(a), we must understand what the right of action is.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">A</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The right of action that is invoked in many administrative-law cases, including this one, is a statutory claim that an agency has violated certain legal requirements when it took a certain action, such that the agency’s action itself is invalid.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <a aria-label=\"5 USC 706 2\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/706#2\">5 U. S. C. §706(2)</a>.  And Congress has repeatedly made clear, through various statutory enactments, that in the administrative-law context, the statute of limitations for filing a claim that seeks to invalidate the agency action runs from the moment of final agency action.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Take the Administrative Orders Review Act (also known as the Hobbs Act), for example.  See <a aria-label=\"28 USC 2342\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2342\">28 U. S. C. §2342</a>.  That statute is the exclusive mechanism for reviewing certain orders issued by over a half-dozen federal agencies.  The Act requires suits to be brought “within 60 days after [the] entry” of any final agency order.  §2344.  There are many other similar statutes.  In its brief, the Government provided us with more than two dozen statutory provisions where the limitations period starts running at the moment of final agency action—whether that action is the publication of a rule, or the issuance of an order, or something else.  See Brief for Respondent 15–17, and n. 4.  And, as the Government itself acknowledges, even that list is not comprehensive.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 51 (“Candidly, we got to a page-long footnote and stopped”).<a aria-label=\"reference 5 of Jackson Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-5\" id=\"DISSENT_6-5ref\"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; Despite the dozens of statutes that start the limitations period at the moment of final agency action, neither Corner Post nor the majority identifies a single statute in the administrative-law context—either now or before 1948—that takes any other approach.  This tells us exactly the message that Congress might have expected courts to infer when interpreting §2401(a): For administrative-law actions, a claim accrues at the moment of final agency action.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Court says we must ignore these other statutes because they post-date Congress’s 1948 enactment of §2401(a).  See <em>ante,</em> at 12–14. The majority’s reasoning is doubly wrong.  First, it is wrong on the facts.  Even before 1948, Congress consistently started limitations periods in the administrative-law context at the moment of the last &nbsp;agency action.<a aria-label=\"reference 6 of Jackson Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-6\" id=\"DISSENT_6-6ref\"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup></a>  Then, as now, Congress decided that the deadline for reviewing agency actions should be pegged to the action under review.  Second, the majority misses the broader point: Whenever Congress imposes a deadline to challenge an agency decision, the limitations period always starts at the moment of the last agency action.  We should pay attention to the uniformly expressed judgment of Congress, and read §2401(a) accordingly.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Somehow, the majority draws the opposite conclusion.  In its view, either Congress’s consistently expressed intention is irrelevant to what §2401(a) means, or Congress’s failure to explicitly express that intention in the text of §2401(a) indicates that Congress decided otherwise in this particular statute (after all, Congress could have expressly pegged accrual to final agency action in §2401(a) but did not do so).  See <em>ante,</em> at 8–10. <a aria-label=\"reference 7 of Jackson Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-7\" id=\"DISSENT_6-7ref\"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup></a>  But mechanically drawing these sorts &nbsp;of negative inferences when interpreting statutes can be risky.  “Context counts, and it is sometimes difficult to read much into the absence of a word that is present elsewhere in a statute.”  <em>Bartenwerfer</em> v. <em>Buckley</em>, <a aria-label=\"598 U. S. 69\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/598/69\">598 U. S. 69</a>, 78 (2023).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The majority’s approach overlooks relevant context in all sorts of ways, including the fact that §2401(a) is a catchall provision that applies to a variety of actions—that is, the language we are interpreting here does not apply <em>only</em> in the administrative-law context.  It applies to <em>every</em> suit against the United States not covered by another statute of limitations.  One cannot expect for Congress to have explicitly stated that accrual in §2401(a) starts at the point of final agency action when §2401(a) is a residual provision that also applies to claims that do not involve agency action at all.<a aria-label=\"reference 8 of Jackson Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-8\" id=\"DISSENT_6-8ref\"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Frankly, it was also entirely unnecessary for Congress to be explicit regarding its intentions. Again, in the administrative-law context, the consistent rule is <em>not</em> the plaintiff-specific accrual rule that exists in other contexts (<em>e.g.,</em>  torts), but the rule that applies every time Congress has ever mentioned a limitations period with respect to a suit against an agency: The claim accrues at the moment of final agency action.  So it is no wonder that Congress did not expressly mention this in the text of §2401(a)—it did not have to, for those who have a basic understanding of its statutes.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> What is more, the standard accrual rule for the administrative-law context makes perfect sense.  The APA itself focuses on the agency’s action, not on the plaintiff.  Section 704 subjects certain “agency action[s]” to judicial review.  &nbsp;Section 706 lays out the scope of judicial review.  As relevant here, courts shall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  <a aria-label=\"5 USC 706 2 A\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/706#2_A\">5 U. S. C. §706(2)(A)</a>.  Other subsections of §706 likewise focus exclusively on what the <em>agency</em> did.  Did the <em>agency</em> act “in excess of statutory jurisdiction”?  §706(2)(C).  Did the <em>agency</em> act “without observance of procedure required by law”?  §706(2)(D).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Section 702 is not to the contrary.  The majority suggests otherwise, characterizing §702 as “equip[ping] injured parties with a cause of action.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 5.  This is a misleading characterization. Section 702 restricts <em>who</em> may challenge agency action: only those “person[s] suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action.”  It is simply a limitation on who can sue.  As such, it says nothing about the cause of action that such a person might bring, nor does it establish that an injury is an element of the claim, as the majority mistakenly suggests.<a aria-label=\"reference 9 of Jackson Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-9\" id=\"DISSENT_6-9ref\"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup></a>  And that is for good reason, since, in administrative &nbsp;actions, the claim itself remains focused on the agency.  See <em>Crown Coat</em>, 386 U. S., at 513 (“The focus of the court action is the validity of the administrative decision”).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The way that courts review agency actions also reinforces this basic observation.  Courts do not look at what happened to the plaintiff or what happened after the rulemaking—they look only at the rule and the rulemaking process itself.  See <em>SEC</em> v. <em>Chenery Corp.</em>, <a aria-label=\"318 U. S. 80\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/318/80\">318 U. S. 80</a>, 95 (1943).  “[T]he focal point for judicial review should be the administrative record already in existence, not some new record made initially in the reviewing court.” <em>Camp</em> v. <em>Pitts</em>, <a aria-label=\"411 U. S. 138\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/411/138\">411 U. S. 138</a>, 142 (1973) (<em>per curiam</em>).  Anything that happened after the rule’s publication (including, perhaps, some injury to a regulated party) does not matter to an APA claim. So, the available claims, causes of action, and evidence are the same regardless of who brings the challenge or when they bring it.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Again, the complaint in this case proves the point.  Before Corner Post was added as a plaintiff, the complaint alleged that (1) Regulation II is contrary to law and exceeds the Board’s statutory authority, and (2) Regulation II is arbitrary and capricious.  See Complaint in <em>North Dakota Retail Assn. </em>v.<em> Board of Governors</em> <em>of FRS</em>, No. 1:21–cv–00095 (D ND), ECF Doc. 1, pp. 32–36.  After Corner Post was added as a plaintiff, the complaint made exactly those same two legal claims.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 79–84.  Before Corner Post was added, the contrary-to-law claim said that the Board considered impermissible costs and capped interchange fees in a way that was not proportional to the specific costs of each transaction.  See ECF Doc. 1, at 32–34.  After Corner Post was added, the contrary-to-law claim said the exact same thing.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 79–81.  Be&nbsp;fore the addition of Corner Post, the arbitrary-and-capricious claim said that the Board failed to consider certain congressional instructions, relied on factors that Congress did not intend for it to consider, and ran counter to evidence before the Board.  See ECF Doc. 1, at 34–36.  Those claims, too, were unchanged after the addition of Corner Post.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 82–84. </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> From the pleadings filed in this case, three observations stand out.  First, these APA claims, like all APA claims, are about what the agency itself did, so the logical point to start the clock is the moment the agency acted.  Second, the claims that Corner Post brings are not specific to it—they are identical to the untimely claims the coplaintiff trade groups brought before.  And, finally, although the majority puts procedural challenges to the side—asserting that its holding does not extend to those, see <em>ante,</em> at 21, n. 8—the claims in this case <em>are</em> procedural, so the majority’s line-drawing exercise is meaningless.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> On the matter of congressional intent, the consistent accrual rule in the administrative-law context (the limitations period starts running at the time of the final agency action) is patently superior to the majority’s reading of §2401(a).  Congress enacts statutes of limitations to achieve basic policy goals: “repose, elimination of stale claims, and certainty about a plaintiff ’s opportunity for recovery and a defendant’s potential liabilities.” <em>Rotella</em> v. <em>Wood</em>, <a aria-label=\"528 U. S. 549\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/528/549\">528 U. S. 549</a>, 555 (2000); see also <em>Gabelli</em>, 568 U. S., at 448.  For APA claims, where rulemakings apply to the public writ large, repose and certainty would <em>never</em> exist if any and every newly formed entity can challenge every agency regulation in existence.  Stated simply, the majority has adopted an implausible reading of §2401(a), because, as I explain below, a plaintiff-specific accrual rule operating in this context undermines each of the central goals of all limitations &nbsp;provisions.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> First, repose.  This principle means that, at some point, litigation must end.  Under the majority’s reading of the statute, it never will.  Instead of putting a stop to things after six years, §2401(a) now does nothing to prevent agency rules from being forever subjected to legal challenge by newly formed entities (or, as this case illustrates, by old entities that can find or create new entities to graft onto their complaint).<a aria-label=\"reference 10 of Jackson Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-10\" id=\"DISSENT_6-10ref\"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Second, elimination of stale claims.  The majority forces courts and agencies to parse cold administrative records.  Long after the action in question, courts may be ill equipped to review decades-old administrative explanations.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Last, certainty.  As I explain in Part IV, <em>infra</em>, the majority’s approach creates uncertainty for the Government and every entity that relies on the Government to function.  Agency rulemaking serves important “notice and predictability purposes.”  <em>Talk America, Inc.</em> v. <em>Michigan Bell Telephone Co</em>., <a aria-label=\"564 U. S. 50\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/564/50\">564 U. S. 50</a>, 69 (2011) (Scalia, J., concurring).  When an administrative agency changes its own rules, it follows specific, established processes, so parties have some predictability about how the rules of the road might change.  But when every rule on the books can perpetually be challenged by any new plaintiff, and is thus subject to limitless ad hoc amendment, no policy determination can ever be put to rest, and certainty about the rules that govern will forever remain elusive.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">&nbsp;IV</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Today’s ruling is not only baseless.  It is also extraordinarily consequential.  In one fell swoop, the Court has effectively eliminated any limitations period for APA lawsuits, despite Congress’s unmistakable policy determination to cut off such suits within six years of the final agency action.  The Court has decided that the clock starts for limitations purposes whenever a new regulated entity is created.  This means that, from this day forward, administrative agencies can be sued in perpetuity over every final decision they make.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The majority’s ruling makes legal challenges to decades-old agency decisions fair game, even though courts of appeals had previously applied §2401(a) to find untimely a range of belated APA challenges.  For example, a lower court rejected an APA challenge to the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the abortion medication mifepristone that was brought more than two decades after the relevant agency action.  See<em> Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine </em>v. <em>FDA</em>, 78 F. 4th 210, 242 (CA5 2023).  A 2008 APA challenge to a 1969 ruling by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives implementing the Gun Control Act was also bounced on statute of limitations grounds.  See <em>Hire Order Ltd. </em>v.<em> Marianos</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/698_F.3d_168\">698 F. 3d 168</a>, 170 (CA4 2012).  Other unquestionably tardy APA suits have been dismissed on similar grounds too.<a aria-label=\"reference 11 of Jackson Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-11\" id=\"DISSENT_6-11ref\"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> No more.  After today, even the most well-settled agency &nbsp;regulations can be placed on the chopping block.  And please take note: The fallout will not stop with new challenges to old rules involving the most contentious issues of today.  <em>Any</em> established government regulation about <em>any</em> issue—say, workplace safety, toxic waste, or consumer protection—can now be attacked by <em>any</em> new regulated entity within six years of the entity’s formation.  A brand new entity could pop up and challenge a regulation that is <em>decades</em> old; perhaps even one that is as old as the APA itself.  No matter how entrenched, heavily relied upon, or central to the functioning of our society a rule is, the majority has announced open season.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Still, in issuing its ruling in this case, the Court seems oddly oblivious to the most foreseeable consequence of the accrual rule it is adopting: Giving every new entity in a regulated industry its own personal statute of limitations to challenge longstanding regulations affects our Nation’s economy.  Why?  Because administrative agencies establish the baseline rules around which businesses and individuals order their lives.  When an agency publishes a final rule, and the period for challenging that rule passes, people in that industry understand that the agency’s policy choice is the law and act accordingly.  They make investments because of it.  They change their practices because of it.  They enter contracts in light of it.  They may not like the rule, but they live and work with it, because that is what the Rule of Law requires.  It is profoundly destabilizing—and also acutely unfair—to permit newcomers to bring legal challenges that can overturn settled regulations long after the rest of the competitive marketplace has adapted itself to the regulatory environment.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Moreover, as I have explained, the Court’s ruling in this case allows for every new entity to challenge any and every rule that an agency has ever adopted.  It is extraordinarily presumptuous that an entity formed in full view of an &nbsp;agency’s rules, by founders who can choose to enter the industry or not, can demand that well-established rules of engagement be revisited.  But even setting aside those commonsense fairness concerns, the constant churn of potential attacks on an agency’s rules by new entrants can harm <em>all</em> entities in a regulated industry.  At any time, anyone can come along and potentially cause every entity to have to adjust its whole operations manual, since any rule (no matter how well settled) might be subject to alteration.  Indeed, the obvious need for stability in the rules that govern an industry is precisely why a defined period for challenging the rules was needed at all.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Knowledgeable <em>amici</em> have explained that the majority’s approach to accrual of the statute of limitations for APA claims undermines the “[s]tability, predictability, and consistency [that] enable[s] small businesses to survive and thrive.”  Brief for Small Business Associations as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 5.  And there is no question that long-term uncertainty “hinders the ability of businesses to plan effectively.”  <em>Id.,</em> at 9. The majority’s accrual rule unnecessarily creates “frequent, inconsistent, judicially-driven policy changes that do not involve the sort of careful balancing envisioned in the normal process of regulatory change.”  <em>Id.,</em> at 12.  And, again, one might think that preventing such chaos is precisely why Congress enacted a statute of limitations in the first place.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Seeking to minimize the fully foreseeable and potentially devastating impact of its ruling, the majority maintains that there is nothing to see here, because not every lawsuit brought by a new industry upstart will win, and, at any rate, many agency regulations are already subject to challenge.  See <em>ante,</em> at 21.  But this myopic rationalization overlooks other significant changes that this Court has wrought this Term with respect to the longstanding rules governing review of agency actions.  The discerning reader will know that the Court has handed down other decisions this Term &nbsp;that likewise invite and enable a wave of regulatory challenges—decisions that carry with them the possibility that well-established agency rules will be upended in ways that were previously unimaginable.  Doctrines that were once settled are now unsettled, and claims that lacked merit a year ago are suddenly up for grabs.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In <em>Loper Bright Enterprises </em>v. <em>Raimondo</em>, 603 U. S. ___ (2024), for example, the Court has reneged on a blackletter rule of administrative law that had been foundational for the last four decades.  <em>Id</em>., at ___ (slip op., at 30).  Under that prior interpretive doctrine, courts deferred to agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes that Congress authorized the agency to administer.  Now, every legal claim conceived of in those last four decades—and before—can possibly be brought before courts newly unleashed from the constraints of any such deference.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 74 (Assistant to the Solicitor General explaining that this result “would magnify the effect of” overruling <em>Chevron</em>).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Put differently, a fixed statute of limitations, running from the agency’s action, was one barrier to  the chaotic upending of settled agency rules; the requirement that deference be given to an agency’s reasonable interpretations concerning its statutory authority to issue rules was another.  The Court has now eliminated both.  Any new objection to any old rule must be entertained and determined <em>de novo</em> by judges who can now apply their own unfettered judgment as to whether the rule should be voided.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">*  *  *</h3>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> At the end of a momentous Term, this much is clear: The tsunami of lawsuits against agencies that the Court’s holdings in this case and <em>Loper Bright</em> have authorized has the potential to devastate the functioning of the Federal Government.  Even more to the present point, that result simply cannot be what Congress intended when it enacted legislation that stood up and funded federal agencies and &nbsp;vested them with authority to set the ground rules for the individuals and entities that participate in the our economy and our society.  It is utterly inconceivable that §2401(a)’s statute of limitations was meant to permit fresh attacks on settled regulations from all new comers forever.  Yet, that is what the majority holds today.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> But Congress still has a chance to address this absurdity and forestall the coming chaos.  It can opt to correct this Court’s mistake by clarifying that the statutes it enacts are designed to facilitate the functioning of agencies, not to hobble them.  In particular, Congress can amend §2401(a), or enact a specific review provision for APA claims, to state explicitly what any such rule <em>must</em> mean if it is to operate as a limitations period in this context: Regulated entities have six years from the date of the agency action to bring a lawsuit seeking to have it changed or invalidated; after that, facial challenges must end.  By doing this, Congress can make clear that lawsuits bringing facial claims against agencies are not personal attack vehicles for new entities created just for that purpose. So, while the Court has made a mess of this pivotal statute, and the consequences are profound, “the ball is in Congress’ court.”  <em>Ledbetter</em> v. <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"550 U. S. 618\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/550/618\">550 U.

A cash-only business that announces its intent to accept debit cards and thereby claiming injury from the debit-card rule.  New owners that buy out a shop, insisting that they too are entitled to challenge the debit-card rule based on their status as new entrants into the marketplace.  It is telling that, even as the majority says that the moment of the plaintiff ’s injury marks the start of the limitations period for facial APA challenges, the majority fails to describe precisely when<em> </em>that injury occurs in this context.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_6-2\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Jackson Dissent at reference 2\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-2ref\">2</a>  The majority’s opinion says we took this case to resolve a circuit split, suggesting that the Sixth Circuit had reached the contrary conclusion.  See <em>ante, </em>at 3–4.  It had not.  In <em>Herr</em> v. <em>United States Forest Serv.</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/803_F.3d_809\">803 F. 3d 809</a> (2015), the Sixth Circuit addressed accrual in the context of an<em> as-applied</em> challenge after the Government had threatened enforcement.  There, the Circuit pegged accrual to the moment of the injury allegedly caused by application of the rule to the plaintiff, see <em>id</em>., at 820, and did not discuss whether that same accrual rule would apply to facial challenges.  Since <em>Herr</em>, neither the Sixth Circuit nor any district court within it has extended <em>Herr</em>’s rule to facial challenges to final agency actions, and at least one District Court has expressly rejected such an extension. See <em>Linney’s Pizza, LLC </em>v. <em>Board of Governors of FRS</em>, 2023 WL 6050569, *2–*4 (ED Ky., Sept. 15, 2023).</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_6-3\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Jackson Dissent at reference 3\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-3ref\">3</a>  The majority insists on a single definition of “accrued,” but it cannot keep its story straight as to what that definition is.  Its opinion offers multiple formulations, stating that a claim accrues “when it comes into existence,” “when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action,” “when a suit may be maintained thereon,” and, also, “after the plaintiff suffers the injury.” <em>Ante,</em> at 7–8 (internal quotation marks omitted).

The majority’s conclusion that the accrual rule is plaintiff specific for APA claims is no more than <em>ipse dixit</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_6-8\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Jackson Dissent at reference 8\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-8ref\">8</a>  Contra the majority, see <em>ante,</em> at 12, the fact that Congress <em>could</em> have<em> </em>opted to enact a specific statutory review provision for APA claims says nothing about how we should apply the catchall review provision here.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_6-9\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Jackson Dissent at reference 9\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-9ref\">9</a>  The majority puts too much stock in the fact that §702 references an injury:  That reference actually does no more than highlight the distinction between what constitutes a claim and who can bring that claim.  See <em>ante,</em> at 4–5, and n. 1.  This type of distinction is commonplace in many areas of our jurisprudence.  Take, for example, the constitutional standing doctrine, which limits eligible plaintiffs to those who have suffered an injury in fact that is both traceable to the defendant’s conduct and redressable in court.  See <em>FDA </em>v. <em>Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine</em>, <a aria-label=\"602 U. S. 367\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/602/367\">602 U. S. 367</a>, 380–385 (2024).  Whether a particular plaintiff has standing to sue says nothing about the elements of the claim itself.  See <em>Haaland</em> v. <em>Brackeen</em>, <a aria-label=\"599 U. S. 255\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/599/255\">599 U. S. 255</a>, 291 (2023) (“We do not reach the merits of these claims because no party before the Court has standing to raise them”).  The distinction between what a claim is and who can bring it applies with full force here.  Section 702 codifies an injury requirement for bringing APA claims.  Whether a particular plaintiff was “adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute” under §702 is a threshold inquiry about whether she is an appropriate plaintiff; it has no bearing on whether the agency did, in fact, act in a manner that was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,” §706(2).</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_6-10\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Jackson Dissent at reference 10\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-10ref\">10</a>  The fact that “courts entertaining later challenges often will be able to rely on binding Supreme Court or circuit precedent,” <em>ante,</em> at 21, is irrelevant.

The next subsection extends that prohibition to anyone who “otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding, or attempts to do so.”  §1512(c)(2).  Petitioner Joseph Fischer was charged with violating §1512(c)(2) for his conduct on January 6, 2021.  On that day, Congress convened in a joint session to certify the votes in the 2020 Presidential election.  While they did so, a crowd of supporters of then-President Donald Trump gathered outside the Capitol, and some eventually forced their way into the building, breaking windows and assaulting police.  App. 189.  This breach of the Capitol delayed the certification of the vote.  The criminal complaint alleges that Fischer was among those who invaded the building.  Fischer was charged with various crimes for his actions on January 6, including obstructing an official proceeding in violation of §1512(c)(2).  He moved to dismiss that charge, arguing that the provision criminalizes only attempts to impair the availability or integrity of evidence.  The District Court granted his motion in relevant part.  A divided panel of the D.&nbsp;C. Circuit reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-e jy-both\"><em>Held</em>: To prove a violation of §1512(c)(2), the Government must establish that the defendant impaired the availability or integrity for use in an official proceeding of records, documents, objects, or other things used in an official proceeding, or attempted to do so.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\"> (a) To determine the scope of the residual “otherwise” clause in §1512(c)(2), the Court must decide how it is linked to its “surrounding &nbsp;words,”  <em>Yates</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"574 U. S. 528\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/574/528\">574 U.&nbsp;S. 528</a>, 536 (plurality opinion), and “&nbsp;‘give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of [the] statute.’&nbsp;”  <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Taylor</em>, <a aria-label=\"529 U. S. 362\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/529/362\">529 U.&nbsp;S. 362</a>, 404 (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Menasche</em>, <a aria-label=\"348 U. S. 528\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/348/528\">348 U.&nbsp;S. 528</a>, 538-539).  The Court considers both “the specific context” in which (c)(2) appears “and the broader context of the statute as a whole.”  <em>Robinson </em>v.<em> Shell Oil Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"519 U. S. 337\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/519/337\">519 U.&nbsp;S. 337</a>, 341.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">  (1) Section 1512(c)(1) describes particular types of criminal conduct in specific terms.  The purpose of (c)(2) is, as the parties agree, to cover some set of “matters not specifically contemplated” by (c)(1).  <em>Republic of Iraq </em>v. <em>Beaty</em>, <a aria-label=\"556 U. S. 848\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/556/848\">556 U.&nbsp;S. 848</a>, 860.  Perhaps Congress sought to criminalize <em>all </em>obstructive acts in §1512(c), and having named a few examples in (c)(1), devised (c)(2) to prohibit the rest.  But (c)(2) could have a narrower scope if Congress designed it to fill inadvertent gaps in the focused language of (c)(1).</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\"> One way to discern the reach of an “otherwise” clause is to look for guidance from whatever examples come before it.  Two general principles are relevant.  First, the canon of <em>noscitur a sociis</em> teaches that a word is “given more precise content by the neighboring words with which it is associated.”<em>  United States</em> v. <em>Williams</em>, <a aria-label=\"553 U. S. 285\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/553/285\">553 U.&nbsp;S. 285</a>, 294.  And under the related canon of <em>ejusdem generis</em>, a general or collective term at the end of a list of specific items is typically controlled and defined by reference to those specific items that precede it.  <em>Southwest Airlines Co. </em>v. <em>Saxon</em>, <a aria-label=\"596 U. S. 450\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/596/450\">596 U.&nbsp;S. 450</a>, 458.  These approaches to statutory interpretation track the common sense intuition that Congress would not ordinarily introduce a general term that renders meaningless the specific text that accompanies it.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\"> Under these principles, the “otherwise” provision of §1512(c)(2) is limited by the list of specific criminal violations that precede it in (c)(1).  If, as the Government asserts, (c)(2) covers all forms of obstructive conduct <em>beyond </em>§1512(c)(1)’s focus on evidence impairment, Congress would have had little reason to provide any specific examples at all.  And the sweep of subsection (c)(2) would swallow (c)(1), leaving that narrower provision with no work to do.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\"> Tethering subsection (c)(2) to the context of (c)(1) recognizes the distinct purpose of each provision.  Subsection (c)(1) refers to a defined set of offense conduct—four types of actions that, by their nature, impair the integrity or availability of records, documents, or objects for use in an official proceeding.  Reading the “otherwise” clause as having been given more precise content by (c)(1), subsection (c)(2) makes it a crime to impair the availability or integrity of records, documents, or objects used in an official proceeding in ways other than those specified in (c)(1).  For example, it is possible to violate (c)(2) by creating false evidence—rather than altering incriminating evidence.  Subsection &nbsp;(c)(2) also ensures that liability is still imposed for impairing the availability or integrity of <em>other</em> things used in an official proceeding beyond the “record[s], document[s], or other object[s]” enumerated in (c)(1), such as witness testimony or intangible information.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">  (2) It makes sense to read (c)(2) as limited by (c)(1) in light of the history of the provision.  The Enron accounting scandal exposed a loophole in §1512.  At that time, the statute imposed liability on anyone who, among other things, corruptly persuaded another person to shred documents.  But it curiously failed to impose liability on a person who destroyed records himself.  The parties agree that Congress enacted §1512(c) as part of the broader Sarbanes-Oxley Act to plug this loophole.  It would be peculiar to conclude that in closing the Enron gap, Congress created a catch-all provision that reaches beyond the scenarios that prompted the legislation.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\"> (b) The broader context of §1512 in the criminal code confirms that (c)(2) is limited by the scope of (c)(1).  Federal obstruction law consists of numerous provisions that target specific criminal acts and settings, much of which would be unnecessary if (c)(2) criminalized essentially all obstructive conduct.  Given the Court’s obligation to give meaning where possible to each word and provision in the Code, <em>Taylor</em>, 529 U.&nbsp;S., at 404, the Court’s narrower interpretation of subsection (c)(2) is the superior one.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\"> An unbounded interpretation of subsection (c)(2) would also render superfluous the careful delineation of different types of obstructive conduct in §1512 itself.  That section provides a reticulated list of nearly two dozen means of committing obstruction with penalties ranging from three years to life in prison, or even death.  The Government’s reading would lump together under (c)(2) disparate types of conduct for which Congress had assigned proportionate sentences.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\"> (c) The Government’s theory would also criminalize a broad swath of prosaic conduct, exposing activists and lobbyist to decades in prison.  Our usual approach in obstruction cases has been to “resist reading” particular sub-provisions “to create a coverall statute.”  <em>Yates</em>, 574 U.&nbsp;S., at 549 (plurality opinion).  Nothing in the text or statutory history gives the Court a reason to depart from that practice today.  And the Government’s interpretation would give prosecutors broad discretion to seek a 20-year maximum sentence for acts Congress saw fit to punish with far shorter sentences.  By reading (c)(2) in light of (c)(1), the Court affords proper respect to “the prerogatives of Congress” in carrying out the quintessentially legislative act of defining crimes and setting the penalties for them.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Aguilar</em>, <a aria-label=\"515 U.

The next subsection extends that prohibition to anyone who “otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding, or attempts to do so.”  §1512(c)(2).  We consider whether this “otherwise” clause should be read in light of the limited reach of the specific provision that precedes it.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">I</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> This case concerns the prosecution of petitioner Joseph Fischer for his conduct on January 6, 2021.  That day, both Houses of Congress convened in a joint session to certify the votes in the 2020 Presidential election.  While they did so, a crowd of supporters of then-President Donald Trump gathered outside the Capitol.  As set forth in the criminal complaint against Fischer, some of the crowd eventually &nbsp;“forced entry” into the building, “breaking windows,” and “assaulting members of the U.&nbsp;S. Capitol Police.”  App. 189.  This breach of the Capitol caused Members of Congress to evacuate the Chambers and delayed the certification process.  The complaint alleges that Fischer was one of those who invaded the building.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> According to the complaint, about an hour after the Houses recessed, Fischer trespassed into the Capitol and was involved in a physical confrontation with law enforcement.  Fischer claimed in Facebook posts that he “pushed police back about 25 feet,” and that he “was inside the [Capitol] talking to police.”  <em>Id</em>., at 193–194.  Body camera footage shows Fischer near a scrum between the crowd and police who were trying to eject trespassers from the building.  <em>Id</em>., at 195–196.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> A grand jury returned a seven-count superseding indictment against Fischer.  Six of those counts allege that Fischer forcibly assaulted a federal officer, entered and remained in a restricted building, and engaged in disorderly and disruptive conduct in the Capitol, among other crimes.  See <em>id</em>., at 181–185; <a aria-label=\"18 USC\" href=\"/uscode/text/18\">18</a> U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §§<a aria-label=\"18 USC 111 a\" href=\"/uscode/text/18/111#a\">111(a)</a>, <a aria-label=\"18 USC 231 a 3\" href=\"/uscode/text/18/231#a_3\">231(a)(3)</a>, <a aria-label=\"18 USC 1752 a 1\" href=\"/uscode/text/18/1752#a_1\">1752(a)(1)</a>, (a)(2); <a aria-label=\"40 USC 5104 e 2 D\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/40/5104#e_2_D\">40 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §§5104(e)(2)(D)</a>, (G).  Those six counts carry maximum penalties ranging from six months’ to eight years’ imprisonment.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In Count Three, the only count now before us, the Government charged Fischer with violating <a aria-label=\"18 USC 1512 c 2\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1512#c_2\">18 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §1512(c)(2)</a>.  Fischer moved to dismiss that count, arguing that the provision criminalizes only attempts to impair the availability or integrity of evidence.  The District Court granted his motion in relevant part.  It concluded that the scope of Section 1512(c)(2) is limited by subsection (c)(1) and therefore requires the defendant to “&nbsp;‘have taken some action with respect to a document, record, or other object.’&nbsp;”  2022 WL 782413, *4 (DC, Mar. 15, 2022) (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Miller</em>, 589 F.&nbsp;Supp. 3d 60, 78 (DC 2022)).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; A divided panel of the D. C. Circuit reversed and remanded for further proceedings.  Judge Pan, writing for the court, held that the word “otherwise” in Section 1512(c)(2) means that the provision  unambiguously covers “all forms of corrupt obstruction of an official proceeding, other than the conduct that is already covered by §1512(c)(1).”  64 F.&nbsp;4th 329, 336 (2023).  Judge Walker concurred in part and concurred in the judgment because he read the <em>mens rea </em>element of the statute—“corruptly”—as requiring a defendant to act with “an intent to procure an unlawful benefit.”  <em>Id</em>., at 361 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Judge Katsas dissented.  In his view, the language in subsection (c)(1) narrows the language that comes after the word “otherwise” in subsection (c)(2).  He therefore construed Section 1512(c)(2) as applying “only to acts that,” like the ones specified in (c)(1), “affect the integrity or availability of evidence” at an official proceeding.  <em>Id.</em>, at 363.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> We granted certiorari. 601 U.&nbsp;S. ___ (2023).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">II</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The controversy before us is about the scope of the residual “otherwise” clause in Section 1512(c)(2).  On the one hand, Fischer contends that (c)(2) “applies only to acts that affect the integrity or availability of evidence.”  Brief for Petitioner 8.  On the other, the Government argues that (c)(2) “capture[s] all forms of obstructive conduct <em>beyond </em>Section 1512(c)(1)’s focus on evidence impairment.”  Brief for United States 13.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Resolving such a dispute requires us to determine how the residual clause is linked to its “surrounding words.”  <em>Yates</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"574 U.

In doing so, “we must ‘give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of [the] statute.’&nbsp;”  <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Taylor</em>, <a aria-label=\"529 U. S. 362\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/529/362\">529 U.&nbsp;S. 362</a>, 404 (2000) (quoting <em>United States</em> v. <em>Menasche</em>, <a aria-label=\"348 U.

To that end, we &nbsp;consider both “the specific context” in which (c)(2) appears “and the broader context of the statute as a whole.”  <em>Robinson </em>v.<em> Shell Oil Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"519 U.

The problem is defining what exactly Congress left for (c)(2).  Perhaps Congress sought to criminalize <em>all </em>obstructive acts in Section 1512(c), and having named a few examples in (c)(1), devised (c)(2) to prohibit the rest in one go.  The point of (c)(1) would then be to illustrate just one type of conduct among many (c)(2) prohibits; it would be subsidiary to the overarching prohibition in (c)(2).  But &nbsp;(c)(2) could well have a narrower scope if Congress designed it with the focused language of (c)(1) in mind. Subsection (c)(1) would then prohibit particular types of obstructive conduct and (c)(2) would fill any inadvertent gaps that might exist.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> One way to discern the reach of an “otherwise” clause is to look for guidance from whatever examples come before it. Two general principles are relevant. First, the canon of <em>noscitur a sociis</em> teaches that a word is “given more precise content by the neighboring words with which it is associated.”<em>  United States</em> v. <em>Williams</em>, <a aria-label=\"553 U. S. 285\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/553/285\">553 U.&nbsp;S. 285</a>, 294 (2008).  That “&nbsp;avoid[s] ascribing to one word a meaning so broad that it is inconsistent with” “the company it keeps.”  <em>Gustafson</em> v. <em>Alloyd Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"513 U. S. 561\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/513/561\">513 U.&nbsp;S. 561</a>, 575 (1995). And under the related canon of <em>ejusdem generis</em>, “a ‘general or collective term’ at the end of a list of specific items” is typically “&nbsp;‘controlled and defined by reference to’ the specific classes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that precede it.”  <em>Southwest Airlines Co.</em> v. <em>Saxon</em>, <a aria-label=\"596 U. S. 450\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/596/450\">596 U.&nbsp;S. 450</a>, 458 (2022) (quoting first <em>Ali</em> v. <em>Federal Bureau of Prisons</em>, <a aria-label=\"552 U. S. 214\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/552/214\">552 U.&nbsp;S. 214</a>, 225 (2008); then <em>Circuit City Stores, Inc.</em> v. <em>Adams</em>, <a aria-label=\"532 U. S. 105\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/532/105\">532 U.&nbsp;S. 105</a>, 115 (2001)); accord, <em>Bissonnette</em> v. <em>LePage Bakeries Park St., LLC</em>, <a aria-label=\"601 U. S. 246\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/601/246\">601 U.&nbsp;S. 246</a>, 252 (2024).  These approaches to statutory interpretation track the common sense intuition that Congress would not ordinarily introduce a general term that renders meaningless the specific text that accompanies it. </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> To see why, consider a straightforward example.  A zoo might post a sign that reads, “do not pet, feed, yell or throw objects at the animals, or otherwise disturb them.”  If a visitor eats lunch in front of a hungry gorilla, or talks to a friend near its enclosure, has he obeyed the regulation?  Surely yes.  Although the smell of human food or the sound of voices might well disturb gorillas, the specific examples of impermissible conduct all involve direct interaction with and harassment of the zoo animals.  Merely eating or talking is so unlike the examples that the zoo provided that it &nbsp;would be implausible to assume those activities were prohibited, even if literally covered by the language. </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The idea is simply that a general phrase can be given a more focused meaning by the terms linked to it.  That principle ensures—regardless of how complicated a sentence might appear—that none of its specific parts are made redundant by a clause literally broad enough to include them.  See <em>Yates</em>, 574 U.&nbsp;S., at 545–546 (plurality opinion).  For instance, a football league might adopt a rule that players must not “grab, twist, or pull a facemask, helmet, or other equipment with the intent to injure a player, or otherwise attack, assault, or harm any player.”  If a linebacker shouts insults at the quarterback and hurts his feelings, has the linebacker nonetheless followed the rule?  Of course he has.  The examples of prohibited actions all concern dangerous physical conduct that might inflict bodily harm; trash talk is simply not of that kind.  See 64 F.&nbsp;4th, at 365–366 (Katsas, J., dissenting).  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Similarly improbable consequences can result from untethering an “otherwise” provision from the rest of a criminal statute.  Take <em>Begay</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"553 U.S. 137\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/553/137\">553 U.&nbsp;S. 137 (2008)</a> (abrogated on other grounds by <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"576 U.S. 591\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/576/591\">576 U.&nbsp;S. 591 (2015)</a>).  The question there was whether driving under the influence qualified as a “violent felony” under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA).  A “violent felony” was defined in relevant part by ACCA as a crime, punishable by more than a year’s imprisonment, that “&nbsp;‘is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.’&nbsp;”  553 U.&nbsp;S., at 139–140 (quoting <a aria-label=\"18 USC 924 e 2 B ii\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/924#e_2_B_ii\">18 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii)</a> (2000 ed.)).  We recognized that, depending on the context, “the word ‘otherwise’ can”—though not “must”—“refer to a crime that is similar to the listed examples in some respects but different in others.”  553 U.&nbsp;S., at 144 (emphasis deleted).  And we held that while driving under the influence certainly may &nbsp;present a serious risk of physical injury, such an offense was so dissimilar from the previously enumerated examples that it could not be classified as a “violent felony” under the statute.  <em>Id</em>., at 142–146.  The list of crimes that preceded the residual clause—burglary, arson, extortion, and the use of explosives—focused on “purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 144–145 (internal quotation marks omitted).  And if that focus did not extend to the residual clause, ACCA’s 15-year mandatory minimum sentence would apply to a host of offenses “not typically committed by those whom one normally labels ‘armed career criminals’&nbsp;” and that were “far removed .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. from the deliberate kind of behavior associated with violent criminal use of firearms.”<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Roberts Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-1\" id=\"OPINION_4-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a> <em>Id.</em>, at 146–147.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The “otherwise” provision of Section 1512(c)(2) is similarly limited by the preceding list of criminal violations.  The offenses enumerated in subsection (c)(1) cover someone who “alters, destroys, mutilates, or conceals a record, document, or other object .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. with the intent to impair the object’s integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding.”  Complex as subsection (c)(1) may look, it simply consists of many specific examples of prohibited actions undertaken with the intent to impair an object’s integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding: altering a record, altering a document, concealing a record, concealing a document, and so on.  That list is followed immediately by a residual clause in (c)(2).  Guided by the basic logic that Congress would not go to the trouble of spelling out the list in (c)(1) if a neighboring term swallowed it up, the most sen&nbsp;sible inference is that the scope of (c)(2) is defined by reference to (c)(1).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> If, as the Government asserts, (c)(2) covers “all forms of obstructive conduct <em>beyond </em>Section 1512(c)(1)’s focus on evidence impairment,” Brief for United States 13, there would have been scant reason for Congress to provide any specific examples at all.  The sweep of subsection (c)(2) would consume (c)(1), leaving that narrower provision with no work to do.  Indeed, subsection (c)(1) would be an elaborate pumpfake: a list of four types of highly particularized conduct, performed with respect to a record, document, or object and “with the intent to impair the object’s integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding,” followed in the very next subsection—in the same sentence, no less—by a superseding prohibition on <em>all</em> means of obstructing, influencing, or impeding any official proceeding.  Construing Section 1512 in such a way gets the “familiar” analysis we apply to these types of statutes “exactly backwards,” eliminating specific terms because of broad language that follows them, rather than limiting the broad language in light of narrower terms that precede it.  <em>Bissonnette</em>, 601 U.&nbsp;S., at 252, 255.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Tethering subsection (c)(2) to the context of (c)(1) recognizes the distinct purpose of each provision.  See A. Scalia &amp; B. Garner, Reading Law 208 (2012) (“evident purpose” helps define scope of catchall provision).  As we have explained, subsection (c)(1) refers to a defined set of offense conduct—four types of actions that, by their nature, impair the integrity or availability of records, documents, or objects for use in an official proceeding.  When the phrase “otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding” is read as having been given more precise content by that narrower list of conduct, subsection (c)(2) makes it a crime to impair the availability or integrity of records, documents, or objects used in an official proceeding in ways other than those specified in (c)(1). For example, it &nbsp;is possible to violate (c)(2) by creating false evidence—rather than altering incriminating evidence.  See,<em> e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>United States</em> v. <em>Reich</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/479_F.3d_179\">479 F. 3d 179</a>, 185–187 (CA2 2007) (Sotomayor, J.) (prosecution under subsection (c)(2) for transmitting a forged court order).  Subsection (c)(2) also ensures that liability is still imposed for impairing the availability or integrity of <em>other</em> things used in an official proceeding beyond the “record[s], document[s], or other object[s]” enumerated in (c)(1), such as witness testimony or intangible information.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mintmire</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/507_F.3d_1273\">507 F.&nbsp;3d 1273</a>, 1290 (CA11 2007) (prosecution under subsection (c)(2) based in part on the defendant’s attempt to orchestrate a witness’s grand jury testimony).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The dissent supposes that because the word “otherwise” in (c)(2) can mean “in a different manner,” “by other means,” or “in other respects,” (c)(1) and (c)(2) are “distinct and independent prohibitions.”  <em>Post</em>, at 2, 5 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But the word “otherwise” is not by itself “sufficient to demonstrate that the examples do not limit the scope of the clause.”  <em>Begay</em>, 553 U.&nbsp;S., at 144 (emphasis deleted).  “Otherwise” <em>can</em> link a set of examples to a general phrase and give it more definite meaning—even in statutory sentences that rival the complexity of Section 1512(c). See <em>Finnegan</em> v. <em>Leu</em>, <a aria-label=\"456 U. S. 431\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/456/431\">456 U.&nbsp;S. 431</a>, 437–438 (1982); <em>Breininger</em> v. <em>Sheet Metal Workers</em>, <a aria-label=\"493 U. S. 67\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/493/67\">493 U.&nbsp;S. 67</a>, 91–92 (1989).            </p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">2</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> It makes sense to read subsection (c)(2) as limited by (c)(1) in light of the history of the provision.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Prior to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Section 1512 imposed criminal liability on anyone who “knowingly uses intimidation or physical force, threatens, or corruptly persuades another person” to, among other things, shred documents. <a aria-label=\"18 USC 1512 b 2 B\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1512#b_2_B\">18 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §1512(b)(2)(B)</a> (2000 ed.).  But the Enron accounting scandal revealed a loophole: Although Enron’s “outside &nbsp;auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, had systematically destroyed potentially incriminating documents,” the statute curiously failed to “impos[e] liability on a person who destroys records himself.”  <em>Yates</em>, 574 U.&nbsp;S., at 535–536 (plurality opinion).  As a result, prosecutors had to prove that higher-ups at Enron and Arthur Andersen persuaded someone else to shred documents rather than the more obvious theory that someone who shreds documents is liable for doing so.  See S.&nbsp;Rep. No. 107–146, p. 7 (2002).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The parties agree that to plug this loophole, Congress enacted Section 1512(c)—the provision at issue here—as part of the broader Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  It would be peculiar to conclude that in closing the Enron gap, Congress actually hid away in the second part of the third subsection of Section 1512 a catchall provision that reaches far beyond the document shredding and similar scenarios that prompted the legislation in the first place.  The better conclusion is that subsection (c)(2) was designed by Congress to capture other forms of evidence and other means of impairing its integrity or availability beyond those Congress specified in (c)(1).      </p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<h4 class=\"jy-center\">1</h4>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The broader context of Section 1512 in the criminal code confirms that (c)(2) is limited by the scope of (c)(1).  Federal obstruction law consists of numerous provisions that target specific criminal acts and settings.  See <a aria-label=\"18 USC chapter 73\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/chapter-73\">18 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. ch. 73</a>.  Much of that particularized legislation would be unnecessary if (c)(2) criminalized essentially all obstructive conduct, as the Government contends.  Section 1503(a), for example, makes it a crime to “corruptly, or by threats or force, or by any threatening .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. communication, endeavor[&nbsp;] to influence, intimidate, or impede” any juror or court officer.  Section 1504 covers attempting to influence jurors through written communications.  Section 1505 covers anyone who &nbsp;corruptly obstructs congressional inquiries or investigations.  Section 1507 covers picketing or parading in certain locations “with the intent of interfering with, obstructing, or impeding the administration of justice.”  Section 1509 covers the obstruction of the exercise of rights or performance of duties under court orders.  Section 1510(a) covers obstruction of federal criminal investigations through bribery.  Section 1511(a) covers certain obstruction of state or local law enforcement with the intent to facilitate illegal gambling.  And Sections 1516, 1517, and 1518 address obstructive acts in specific contexts, including federal audits, examinations of financial institutions, and inquiries into healthcare-related offenses.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> If the Government were correct, then the “otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding” provision—which is buried in subsection (c)(2) of Section 1512—would largely obviate the need for that broad array of other obstruction statutes.  In light of our obligation to give meaning where possible to each word and provision in the Code, <em>Taylor</em>, 529 U.&nbsp;S., at 404, our narrower interpretation of subsection (c)(2) is the superior one.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">2</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> An unbounded interpretation of subsection (c)(2) would also render superfluous the careful delineation of different types of obstructive conduct in Section 1512 itself.  That section provides a reticulated list of nearly two dozen means of committing obstruction, with varying degrees of culpability and penalties ranging from three years to life in prison, or even death.  Section 1512(a)(2)(B)(iv), for example, authorizes up to 30 years’ imprisonment for someone who uses or attempts to use physical force against another person with the intent of causing him to be absent from an official proceeding.  See §1512(a)(3)(B)(ii) (specifying punishment).  Section 1512(d)(1), by contrast, authorizes only &nbsp;three years’ imprisonment for someone who harasses another person and thereby dissuades him from attending an official proceeding.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Reading (c)(2) to cover all forms of obstructive conduct would override Congress’s careful delineation of which penalties were appropriate for which offenses.  Most instances of those prohibited acts would instead fall under subsection (c)(2)’s sweeping reach, which provides a 20-year maximum term of imprisonment.  Such a reading of subsection (c)(2) would lump together disparate types of conduct for which Congress had assigned proportionate penalties in (a)(2) and (d)(1).<a aria-label=\"reference 2 of Roberts Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-2\" id=\"OPINION_4-2ref\"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">3</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The Government’s responses to this surplusage problem are not convincing.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> It first argues that because other provisions in Section 1512 would allow conviction in some circumstances on a “lesser <em>mens rea</em> than ‘corruptly,’&nbsp;” they have “a broader compass” than (c)(2).  Brief for United States 34.  For instance, the Government contends that subsection (b) can be violated by “knowing use of intimidation or threats, or misleading conduct.” <em>Id</em>., at 35.  But the Government concedes that “Congress did not define ‘corruptly’ for purposes of Section 1512.”  <em>Id</em>., at 44.  And while the Government suggests that “corruptly” is “&nbsp;‘normally associated with wrongful, immoral, depraved, or evil’&nbsp; conduct,” <em>ibid</em>. (quoting <em>Arthur Andersen LLP</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"544 U. S. 696\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/544/696\">544 U.&nbsp;S. 696</a>, 705 (2005)), it &nbsp;never persuasively explains how “knowingly us[ing&nbsp;] intimidation” or “threat[s]” against someone is not “wrongful.”  §1512(b).  The same is true for most other subparts of Section 1512 that the Government identifies as having a lesser <em>mens rea</em> than (c)(2).  Brief for United States 34; see, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., §1512(a)(1)(A) (criminalizing anyone who “kills or attempts to kill another person, with intent to” prevent attendance in an official proceeding); §1512(a)(2)(B)(iv) (criminalizing anyone who “uses physical force .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. against any person” intending to cause them to be absent from an official proceeding).  None of those other provisions has a <em>mens rea</em> the Government may more readily establish than the “corruptly” <em>mens rea</em> of subsection (c)(2).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Government also contends that its interpretation creates no surplusage because Section 1512’s other “provisions sweep more broadly than an official proceeding.”  Tr. of Oral Arg. 64; Brief for United States 34.  To be sure, subsections (a)(2)(C), (b)(3), and (d)(2) criminalize various means of preventing someone from giving a judge or law enforcement officer information relating to the commission or possible commission of a federal offense or a violation of conditions of supervised release.  And subsections (d)(3) and (4) make it a crime to harass someone and thereby dissuade them from arresting or prosecuting a person alleged to have committed a federal offense.  None of these crimes requires an “official proceeding.”  But not much if any conduct covered by those provisions would escape the Government’s expansive interpretation of subsection (c)(2). For a person to have violated (c)(2), “an official proceeding need not be pending or about to be instituted.”  §1512(f&nbsp;)(1).  And because interference with an arrest or with communications to authorities about federal offenses could very well obstruct the initiation of future official proceedings, the Government’s reading of (c)(2) would still often consume violations of (a)(2)(C), (b)(3), and (d)(2), (3), and (4).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; The dissent tries to solve this surplusage problem by arguing that conduct only violates (c)(2) if it has a “&nbsp;‘relationship in time, causation, or logic’&nbsp;” with an official proceeding.  <em>Post</em>, at 11 (quoting <em>United States</em> v. <em>Aguilar</em>, <a aria-label=\"515 U. S. 593\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/515/593\">515 U.&nbsp;S. 593</a>, 599 (1995)).  Assuming there is such a requirement, it would simply mean that the defendant’s actions “must have the natural and probable effect” of interfering with the proceeding.  <em>Id</em>., at 599 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Such a bar on prosecutions based on “speculative” theories of obstruction, <em>id</em>., at 601, would hardly cabin the reach of (c)(2). </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The dissent points out that our reading creates some surplusage, too.  See <em>post</em>, at 12–13.  In a wide-ranging scheme like Chapter 73, it is true that some provisions will inevitably cover some of the same conduct.  But “surplusage is nonetheless disfavored,” and our “construction that creates substantially less of it is better than a construction that creates substantially more.”  64 F. 4th, at 374 (Katsas, J., dissenting). </p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">III</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> On the Government’s theory, Section 1512(c) consists of a granular subsection (c)(1) focused on obstructive acts that impair evidence and an overarching subsection (c)(2) that reaches all other obstruction.  Even setting surplusage aside, that novel interpretation would criminalize a broad swath of prosaic conduct, exposing activists and lobbyists alike to decades in prison.  As the Solicitor General acknowledged at oral argument, under the Government’s interpretation, a peaceful protester could conceivably be charged under §1512(c)(2) and face a 20-year sentence.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 51–52.  And the Government would likewise have no apparent obstacle to prosecuting under (c)(2) any lobbying activity that “influences” an official proceeding and is undertaken “corruptly.”  Those peculiar results “un&nbsp;derscore[&nbsp;] the implausibility of the Government’s interpretation.”  <em>Van Buren</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"593 U. S. 374\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/593/374\">593 U.&nbsp;S. 374</a>, 394 (2021).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Our usual approach in obstruction cases has been to “resist reading” particular sub-provisions “to create a coverall” statute, as the Government would have us do here.  <em>Yates</em>, 574 U.&nbsp;S., at 549 (plurality opinion); see also<em> Marinello</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"584 U. S. 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/584/1\">584 U.&nbsp;S. 1</a>, 6–11 (2018); <em>Arthur Andersen</em>, 544 U.&nbsp;S., at 703–704.  And there is no reason to depart from that practice today.  Nothing in the text or statutory history suggests that subsection (c)(2) is designed to impose up to 20 years’ imprisonment on essentially all defendants who commit obstruction of justice in any way and who might be subject to lesser penalties under more specific obstruction statutes.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., §§1503(b)(3), 1505.  If Congress had wanted to authorize such penalties for <em>any </em>conduct that delays or influences a proceeding in <em>any</em> way, it would have said so.  Instead, Section 1512 mentions “record,” “document,” or other “object” 26 times.  See <a aria-label=\"18 USC 1512 a 1 B\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1512#a_1_B\">18 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §§1512(a)(1)(B)</a>, (a)(2)(B)(i), (ii), (iii), 1512(b)(2)(A), (B), (C), 1512(c)(1), 1512(f&nbsp;).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Rather than transforming this evidence-focused statute into a one-size-fits-all solution to obstruction of justice, we cabin our reading of subsection (c)(2) in light of the context of subsection (c)(1).  Doing so affords proper respect to “the prerogatives of Congress” in carrying out the quintessentially legislative act of defining crimes and setting the penalties for them.  <em>Aguilar</em>, 515 U.&nbsp;S., at 600.  We have long recognized that “the power of punishment is vested in the legislative, not in the judicial department,” <em>United States</em> v. <em>Wiltberger</em>, 5 Wheat. 76, 95 (1820), and we have as a result “&nbsp;‘traditionally exercised restraint in assessing the reach of a federal criminal statute,’&nbsp;”<em>  Marinello</em>, 584 U.&nbsp;S., at 11 (quoting <em>Aguilar</em>, 515 U.&nbsp;S., at 600).  The Government’s reading of Section 1512 would intrude on that deliberate arrangement of constitutional authority over federal &nbsp;crimes, giving prosecutors broad discretion to seek a 20-year maximum sentence for acts Congress saw fit to punish only with far shorter terms of imprisonment—for example, three years for harassment under §1512(d)(1), or ten years for threatening a juror under §1503.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> For all these reasons, subsection (c)(2)’s “surrounding words” suggest that we should not give this “otherwise” provision the broadest possible meaning.  <em>Yates</em>, 574 U.&nbsp;S., at 536 (plurality opinion).  Although the Government’s all-encompassing interpretation may be literally permissible, it defies the most plausible understanding of why (c)(1) and (c)(2) are conjoined, and it renders an unnerving amount of statutory text mere surplusage.  Given that subsection (c)(2) was enacted to address the Enron disaster, not some further flung set of dangers, it is unlikely that Congress responded with such an unfocused and “grossly incommensurate patch.”  64 F.&nbsp;4th, at 376 (Katsas, J., dissenting).  We therefore decline to adopt the Government’s interpretation, which is inconsistent with “the context from which the statute arose.”  <em>Bond</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"572 U. S. 844\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/572/844\">572 U. S. 844</a>, 860 (2014).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">*  *  *</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> To prove a violation of Section 1512(c)(2), the Government must establish that the defendant impaired the availability or integrity for use in an official proceeding of records, documents, objects, or as we earlier explained, other things used in the proceeding, or attempted to do so.  See <em>supra</em>, at 9.  The judgment of the D. C. Circuit is therefore vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  On remand, the D. C. Circuit may assess the sufficiency of Count Three of Fischer’s indictment in light of our interpretation of Section 1512(c)(2).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"></p>\n<p class=\"flushrgtpara jy-right\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<h3 class=\"fnheader\">Notes</h3>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-1\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Roberts Opinion at reference 1\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-1ref\">1</a> &nbsp;The dissent explains that we subsequently held the ACCA residual clause void for vagueness.

See <em>ante</em>, at 1–2.  The peaceful transfer of power is a fundamental democratic norm, and those who attempted to disrupt it in this way inflicted a deep wound on this Nation.  But today’s case is not about the immorality of those acts.  Instead, the question before this Court is far narrower: What is the scope of the particular crime Congress has outlined in <a aria-label=\"18 USC 1512 c 2\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1512#c_2\">18 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §1512(c)(2)</a>?</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In the United States of America, “men are not subjected to criminal punishment because their conduct offends our patriotic emotions or thwarts a general purpose sought to be effected by specific commands which they have not disobeyed.  Nor are they to be held guilty of offenses which the statutes have omitted, though by inadvertence, to define and condemn.”  <em>Viereck</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"318 U. S. 236\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/318/236\">318 U.&nbsp;S. 236</a>, 245 (1943).  Our commitment to equal justice and the rule of law requires the courts to faithfully apply criminal laws as written, even in periods of national crisis, see, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Cramer</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"325 U. S. 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/325/1\">325 U.&nbsp;S. 1</a>, 46–48 (1945), and even when the conduct alleged is indisputably abhorrent, cf. <em>Michaels</em> v. <em>Davis</em>, 601 U.&nbsp;S. ___, ___ (2024) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Jackson, J.</span>, dissenting from denial of certiorari) (slip op., at 3).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; Notwithstanding the shocking circumstances involved in this case or the Government’s determination that they warrant prosecution, today, this Court’s task is to determine what conduct is proscribed by the criminal statute that has been invoked as the basis for the obstruction charge at issue here.  I join in the Court’s opinion because I agree with the majority that §1512(c)(2) does not reach “&nbsp;‘all forms of obstructive conduct’&nbsp;” and is, instead, “limited by the preceding list of criminal violations” in §1512(c)(1).  <em>Ante,</em> at 7–8.  I write separately to explain why and how that interpretation of §1512(c) follows from the legislative purpose that this statute’s text embodies.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">I</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Our goal in interpreting any statute should be “to give effect to the intent of Congress.”  <em>United States</em> v. <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"310 U. S. 534\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/310/534\">310 U.&nbsp;S. 534</a>, 542 (1940).  There is no question that intent is generally expressed through the text of a statute.  See <em>American Tobacco Co.</em> v. <em>Patterson</em>, <a aria-label=\"456 U. S. 63\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/456/63\">456 U.&nbsp;S. 63</a>, 68 (1982).  “[H]ewing closely to Congress’s will” as embodied in the statute that it wrote “is especially important” when construing laws like this one, which implicate the possible imposition of punitive sanctions.  <em>Pugin</em> v. <em>Garland</em>, <a aria-label=\"599 U. S. 600\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/599/600\">599 U.&nbsp;S. 600</a>, 612 (2023) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Jackson, J.</span>, concurring).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Here, the majority rightly interprets the scope of §1512(c)(2) by “look[ing] for guidance from” the statutory “examples [that] come before” it—those listed in §1512(c)(1).  <em>Ante,</em> at 5.  In my view, the examples that Congress opts to include in the text of a statute evince its intentions concerning what the rule covers and thereby help express a particular legislative purpose.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The majority’s football-based example is illustrative.  In a football league, says the majority, “a rule that players must not ‘grab, twist, or pull a facemask, helmet, or other equipment with the intent to injure a player, or otherwise &nbsp;attack, assault, or harm any player,’&nbsp;” should not be interpreted as being directed at hurt feelings, because the listed “prohibited actions all concern dangerous physical conduct that might inflict bodily harm; trash talk is simply not of that kind.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 6.  I agree.  I would add that it is likewise clear from the listed prohibited acts that such a rule is also not addressing far more serious and unexpected conduct than the kinds of acts that the preceding examples describe, which can result in serious and foreseeable physical injuries during a rough-and-tumble football game.  By contrast, if a player were to shoot or poison another player, the rule’s drafters would expect the police to be called, not a referee.  Thus, we conclude that the rule is best understood to be inapposite with respect to conduct at both extremes of the universe of harmful acts in which a player might conceivably engage.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> We recognize this intuitive fact—that there is a certain category of conduct the rule is designed to prohibit—because we recognize, albeit implicitly, that the drafters of this rule have included these particular examples <em>for a reason</em>.  We understand that, given the preceding list of examples, this rule was adopted with a clear intent concerning its scope.  So, though a broad conception of “harm” is “literally covered by the language” of the rule, <em>ibid</em>., we appreciate that the rule’s drafters did not intend for that term to take on its most expansive meaning.  Instead, the examples help illuminate what the drafters actually intended the rule to cover.  From the preceding list, we can confidently discern that the drafters meant to proscribe only conduct that risks injuries with severity akin to facemask pulling, not trash talk or murder.<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Jackson Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_5-1\" id=\"CONCUR_5-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; The upshot is that, when interpreting the scope of a particular statute or rule, our assessment of the words that the drafters used informs our understanding of what the rule was designed to do.<a aria-label=\"reference 2 of Jackson Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_5-2\" id=\"CONCUR_5-2ref\"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a>  Discerning the rule’s purpose is critical when a court is called upon to interpret the provision.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">II</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Turning to the statutory provision at issue here, the purpose of §1512(c), reflected in its text, is clear.  Subsection (c)(1) is indisputably focused on persons who engage in a particular kind of obstructive conduct: Anyone who “corruptly .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. alters, destroys, mutilates, or conceals a record, document, or other object, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. with the intent to impair the object’s integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding.”  Subsection (c)(2), in turn, is directed at criminal conduct that “otherwise” achieves a similar result.  I therefore agree with the majority that §1512(c)(2)’s reach is narrower than the Government contends.  As the majority holds, §1512(c)(2) “makes it a crime to impair the availability or integrity of records, documents, or objects used in an official proceeding in ways other than those specified in (c)(1)” and to “impai[r] the availability or integrity of <em>other</em> things used in an official proceeding beyond the ‘record[s], document[s], or other object[s]’ enumerated in (c)(1).”  <em>Ante,</em>&nbsp;at 8–9.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This understanding of §1512(c)’s text and purpose is entirely consistent with the statute’s enactment history.  Congress enacted §1512(c) as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which “was prompted by the exposure of Enron’s massive accounting fraud and revelations that the company’s outside auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, had systematically destroyed potentially incriminating documents.”  <em>Yates</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"574 U. S. 528\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/574/528\">574 U.&nbsp;S. 528</a>, 535–536 (2015) (plurality opinion).  When introducing what later became §1512(c) on the Senate floor, Senator Lott emphasized that its principal purpose was to target document destruction, which was, at the time, prohibited “only if .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a subpoena ha[d] been issued for the evidence that ha[d] been destroyed or altered.”  148 Cong. Rec. S6545 (July 10, 2002).  “[T]his section,” he explained, “would allow the Government to charge obstruction against individuals who acted alone, even if the tampering took place prior to the issuance of a grand jury subpoena.”  <em>Ibid</em>.  Similarly, the Senate Report accompanying the proposed statute noted that “current federal obstruction of justice statutes relating to document destruction [were] riddled with loopholes and burdensome proof requirements.”  S. Rep. No.&nbsp;107–146, p.&nbsp;6 (2002).  According to the Senate Report, §1512(c) was drafted to fill these gaps: “When a person destroys evidence with the intent of obstructing any type of investigation and the matter is within the jurisdiction of a federal agency, overly technical legal distinctions should neither hinder nor prevent prosecution and punishment.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 7.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Conversely, there is no indication whatsoever that Congress intended to create a sweeping, all-purpose obstruction statute.  As the majority notes, “[f]ederal obstruction law consists of numerous provisions that target specific criminal acts and settings.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 10.  Outside of the Government’s proposed interpretation of §1512(c), Congress has never enacted “a one-size-fits-all solution to obstruction of &nbsp;justice.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 15.<a aria-label=\"reference 3 of Jackson Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_5-3\" id=\"CONCUR_5-3ref\"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></a>  Meanwhile, many States have done just that.  See J. Decker, The Varying Parameters of Obstruction of Justice in American Criminal Law, 65 La. L.&nbsp;Rev. 49, 77, and n.&nbsp;236 (2004) (collecting statutes).<a aria-label=\"reference 4 of Jackson Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_5-4\" id=\"CONCUR_5-4ref\"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup></a>  The drafters of the Model Penal Code, too, proposed such a general obstruction crime. See ALI, Model Penal Code §242.1, p.&nbsp;201 (1980) (“A person commits a misdemeanor if he purposely obstructs, impairs or perverts the administration of law or other governmental function by force, violence, physical interference or obstacle, breach of official duty, or any other unlawful act”).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Given that Congress has never before passed a similarly broad obstruction law when others have long existed, it is highly unlikely that Congress intended for subsection (c)(2) to establish a first-of-its-kind general federal obstruction crime.  Nothing in the enactment history of §1512(c) suggests that Congress believed that it was creating an all-encompassing statute that would obviate the need for any other obstruction prohibitions.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This conclusion is further reinforced by the fact that, unlike §1512(c)(2), nearly all of the broad, all-purpose obstruction statutes that various States have enacted are classified as misdemeanors.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., Colo. Rev. Stat. §18–8–102(3) (2023); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. 2921.31(B) (Lexis 2024).  As a &nbsp;result, these types of obstruction crimes are generally punishable by up to a year of incarceration.  See 1 W.&nbsp;LaFave, J.&nbsp;Israel, N.&nbsp;King, &amp; O.&nbsp;Kerr, Criminal Procedure §1.8(c), pp.&nbsp;557–558 (4th ed. 2015).  That is so for a reason: As the Model Penal Code’s drafters explained, “the existence of a residual misdemeanor offense” allows for the “appropriately narrow definition of the serious forms of obstruction carrying felony penalties.”  §242.1, Comment&nbsp;2, at 203.  “A broad residual offense .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. provides a hedge against the ingenuity of offenders,” since “[n]ot all forms of obstruction can be anticipated and precisely proscribed in specific offenses.”  <em>Ibid</em>.  But, at the same time, that kind of broad criminal statute “must incorporate certain limitations lest it nullify policy decisions expressed elsewhere.”  <em>Ibid</em>.  In other words, these broad misdemeanor obstruction statutes are “amalgam[s] of generality and constraint.”  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Government’s interpretation of §1512(c)(2), by contrast, exhibits all the generality of these catchall misdemeanor obstruction provisions while displaying none of their restraint.  Section 1512(c)(2) is a felony, and it imposes a 20-year maximum sentence—one of the more severe potential punishments in Chapter 73 of the U.&nbsp;S. Code.  That stands in contrast with Congress’s specification that other serious obstructive acts warrant “far shorter terms of imprisonment—for example, three years for harassment under §1512(d)(1), or ten years for threatening a juror under §1503.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 16.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Finally, it is worth remembering the statutory context in which Congress chose to prohibit the obstruction-related conduct we are considering today.  The statute Congress wrote addresses this matter in a 13-word phrase, enumerated “2,” that is located within subsection (c) of a much broader §1512, which itself consists of “a reticulated list of nearly two dozen means of committing obstruction.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 11.  However we might interpret Congress’s drafting choices in other contexts, we should be wary of finding that &nbsp;a statute addresses significant criminal conduct when none of the available indicia of congressional intent, including the prohibition’s placement, suggest that Congress intended that result.  Here, it beggars belief that Congress would have inserted a breathtakingly broad, first-of-its-kind criminal obstruction statute (accompanied by a substantial 20-year maximum penalty) in the midst of a significantly more granular series of obstruction prohibitions without clarifying its intent to do so—not in the text of the provision itself, nor in the surrounding statutory context, nor in any statement issued during the enactment process.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">*  *  *</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> In my view, the Court properly interprets §1512(c)(2) in the opinion it issues today.  It also rightly vacates the judgment below and remands this case for further proceedings.  Joseph Fischer was charged with violating §1512(c)(2) by corruptly obstructing “a proceeding before Congress, specifically, Congress’s certification of the Electoral College vote.”  App. 183.  That official proceeding plainly used certain records, documents, or objects—including, among others, those relating to the electoral votes themselves.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 65–67.  And it might well be that Fischer’s conduct, as alleged here, involved the impairment (or the attempted impairment) of the availability or integrity of things used during the January 6 proceeding “in ways other than those specified in (c)(1).”  <em>Ante,</em> at 8.  If so, then Fischer’s prosecution under §1512(c)(2) can, and should, proceed.  That issue remains available for the lower courts to determine on remand.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<h3 class=\"fnheader\">Notes</h3>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"CONCUR_5-1\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Jackson Concurrence at reference 1\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#CONCUR_5-1ref\">1</a> &nbsp;The majority invokes the canons of <em>noscitur a sociis</em> and <em>ejusdem generis</em> to support this inference.  See <em>ante,</em> at 5.  Those canons are useful interpretive tools, but in my view, they are ultimately only devices used in furtherance of achieving our goal of determining “the intent of Congress.”  <em>United States</em> v. <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"310 U. S. 534\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/310/534\">310 U.&nbsp;S. 534</a>, 542 (1940).  “There is no invariable rule for the discovery of that intention.”  <em>Ibid</em>.  As one treatise explains, such canons are “not .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. rule[s] of law” but rather “one of various factors to be considered.”  A. Scalia &amp; B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 212 (2012); see also <em>id</em>., at 196–198.  We apply these canons because we understand that their principles are consistent with how users of language—including legislators—convey meaning.  See <em>id</em>., at 212 (“Any lawyer or legislative drafter who writes two or more specifics followed by a general residual term without the intention that the residual term be limited may be guilty of malpractice”).  As such, they are valid indicia of Congress’s purpose.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"CONCUR_5-2\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Jackson Concurrence at reference 2\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#CONCUR_5-2ref\">2</a> &nbsp;Other indicia of the drafters’ intent, such as the rule’s context or enactment history, can further inform our understanding of the rule.

At the time, Congress was meeting in a joint session to certify the Electoral College results.  The riot forced Congress to suspend the proceeding, delaying it for several hours.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Court does not dispute that Congress’s joint session qualifies as an “official proceeding”; that rioters delayed the proceeding; or even that Fischer’s alleged conduct (which includes trespassing and a physical confrontation with law enforcement) was part of a successful effort to forcibly halt the certification of the election results.  Given these premises, the case that Fischer can be tried for “obstructing, influencing, or impeding an official proceeding” seems open and shut.  So why does the Court hold otherwise?</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Because it simply cannot believe that Congress meant what it said.  Section 1512(c)(2) is a very broad provision, and admittedly, events like January 6th were not its target.  (Who could blame Congress for that failure of imagination?)  But statutes often go further than the problem that inspired them, and under the rules of statutory interpretation, we stick to the text anyway.  The Court, abandoning that approach, does textual backflips to find some way—<em>any</em> way—to narrow the reach of subsection (c)(2).  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">I</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The case for the Government’s interpretation is straightforward.  It can be accomplished in three paragraphs, as compared to the Court’s many, many more.  <em>Ante</em>, at 4–12.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Start with the verbs: To “obstruct” and to “impede” mean to “hinder” or “retard” something’s “passage” or “progress.”  10 Oxford English Dictionary 668 (2d ed. 1989); 7 <em>id</em>., at 705.  We have previously explained that these words are “broad.”  <em>Marinello </em>v.<em> United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"584 U. S. 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/584/1\">584 U.&nbsp;S. 1</a>, 7 (2018).  To “influence” is similarly expansive, meaning “[t]o affect the condition of&nbsp;” or “to have an effect on” something.  7 Oxford English Dictionary, at 940.  The object of these verbs is an “official proceeding,” defined to include “a proceeding before the Congress.”  <a aria-label=\"18 USC 1515 a 1 B\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1515#a_1_B\">18 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §1515(a)(1)(B)</a>.<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Barrett Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-1\" id=\"DISSENT_6-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a>  So (c)(2) covers all sorts of actions that affect or interfere with official proceedings.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> “[O]therwise,” which introduces <a aria-label=\"18 USC 1512 c 2\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1512#c_2\">18 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §1512(c)(2)</a>, does not narrow its scope.  “Otherwise” means “in a different manner,” “by other means,” or “in other respects.”  10 Oxford English Dictionary, at 984; Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 1598 (2002).  It is often used to introduce a “catchall phras[e].”  <em>Texas Dept. of Housing and Community Affairs </em>v.<em> Inclusive Communities Project</em>, <a aria-label=\"576 U. S. 519\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/576/519\">576 U.&nbsp;S. 519</a>, 535 (2015).  Here, “otherwise” tells the reader how (c)(1) and (c)(2) fit together.  Subsection (c)(1) prohibits “alter[ing], destroy[ing], mutilat[ing], or conceal[ing] a record, document, or other object” with “intent to impair [its] integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding.”  In other words, (c)(1) targets document and object spoliation—&nbsp;classic means of obstruction.  Subsection (c)(2) then prohibits obstructing, influencing, or impeding an official proceeding by means <em>different</em> from those specified in (c)(1), thereby serving as a catchall.  The “enumerated” crimes in (c)(1) and the “unenumerated crimes” in (c)(2) are similar “on one specific dimension”: “the <em>particular</em> similarity specified after the ‘otherwise.’&nbsp;”  <em>Begay </em>v.<em> United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"553 U. S. 137\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/553/137\">553 U.&nbsp;S. 137</a>, 150–151 (2008) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).  Here, that means that each crime represents one means through which to obstruct, influence, or impede an official proceeding.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Joseph Fischer allegedly participated in a riot at the Capitol that forced the delay of Congress’s joint session on January 6th.  Blocking an official proceeding from moving forward surely qualifies as obstructing or impeding the proceeding by means <em>other than</em> document destruction.  Fischer’s alleged conduct thus falls within (c)(2)’s scope.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">II</h3>\n<h4 class=\"jy-center\">A</h4>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Opting for a narrower approach, the Court declines to take (c)(2) on its own terms.  Instead, it borrows the evidentiary focus of (c)(1) to hold that a defendant violates (c)(2) only by “impair[ing] the availability or integrity for use in an official proceeding of records, documents, objects, or<em> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. </em>other things used in the proceeding.”  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  Other means of obstructing a proceeding—say, by shutting it down—are out.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This interpretation might sound faithful to the statute, because the limit comes from a related provision rather than thin air.  But snipping words from one subsection and grafting them onto another violates our normal interpretive principles.  “&nbsp;‘[W]e ordinarily resist reading words or elements into a statute that do not appear on its face.’&nbsp;”  <em>Dean </em>v.<em> United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"556 U.

The Court’s reasons for departing from these rules are thin.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">1</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The Court begins with the <em>noscitur a sociis</em> and <em>ejusdem generis </em>canons.  <em>Ante</em>, at 5.  The <em>noscitur</em> canon counsels that “words grouped in a list should be given related meanings.”  A. Scalia &amp; B. Garner, Reading Law §31, p. 195 (2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).  It is particularly useful when interpreting “&nbsp;‘a word [that] is capable of many meanings.’&nbsp;”  <em>McDonnell </em>v.<em> United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"579 U. S. 550\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/579/550\">579 U.&nbsp;S. 550</a>, 569 (2016) (quoting <em>Jarecki </em>v. <em>G.&nbsp;D. Searle &amp; Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"367 U. S. 303\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/367/303\">367 U.&nbsp;S. 303</a>, 307 (1961)).  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Gustafson </em>v.<em> Alloyd Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"513 U. S. 561\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/513/561\">513 U.&nbsp;S. 561</a>, 573–575 (1995) (employing the canon to interpret “communication” in the statutory list “&nbsp;‘prospectus, notice, circular, advertisement, letter, or communication’&nbsp;”).  The <em>ejusdem </em>canon applies when “a catchall phrase” follows “an enumeration of specifics, as in <em>dogs</em>, <em>cats</em>, <em>horses</em>, <em>cattle</em>, and <em>other animals</em>.”  Scalia &amp; Garner §32, at 199.  We often interpret the catchall phrase to “embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words.”  <em>Circuit City Stores, Inc. </em>v.<em> Adams</em>, <a aria-label=\"532 U. S. 105\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/532/105\">532 U.&nbsp;S. 105</a>, 115 (2001).  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs. </em>v.<em> Guardianship Estate of Keffeler</em>, <a aria-label=\"537 U. S. 371\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/537/371\">537 U.&nbsp;S. 371</a>, 375, 385 (2003) (employing the canon to construe the general term in the statutory list “&nbsp;‘execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process’&nbsp;”).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> These canons are valuable tools.  But applying either to (c)(2) is like using a hammer to pound in a screw—it looks like it might work, but using it botches the job.  Unlike the &nbsp;pattern to which the <em>noscitur</em> canon applies, §1512(c) is not a list of terms that includes an ambiguous word.  So the Court does not do what it does when applying <em>noscitur</em>: select between multiple accepted meanings of the words “obstructs,” “influences,” and “impedes.”  Instead, it modifies those words by adding an adverbial phrase: obstructs, influences or impedes by “<em>impair[ing] the availability or integrity for use in an official proceeding of records, documents, or objects</em>.”  <em>Ante</em>, at 16 (emphasis added).  The <em>ejusdem</em> canon is an equally poor fit.  Unlike the pattern to which <em>ejusdem</em> applies, (c)(2) is “<em>not</em> a general or collective term following a list of specific items to which a particular statutory command is applicable.”  <em>United States </em>v.<em> Aguilar</em>, <a aria-label=\"515 U. S. 593\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/515/593\">515 U.&nbsp;S. 593</a>, 615 (1995) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Instead, (c)(1) and (c)(2) are “distinct and independent prohibitions.”  <em>Ibid</em>.  Though they share a subject and an adverb—“[w]hoever corruptly”—the two clauses contain different verbs that take different objects.  §1512(c).  Moreover, (c)(1) has a separate <em>mens rea</em> provision that further disrupts the connection between the clauses.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> To my knowledge, we have never applied either of these canons to a statute resembling §1512(c).  Rather than identify such a case, the Court invents examples of a sign at the zoo and a football league rule.  <em>Ante</em>, at 5–6.  The zoo example (“do not pet, feed, yell or throw objects at the animals, or otherwise disturb them”) does not help, because it mimics the typical <em>ejusdem</em> format of specific words followed by a catchall.  The list of specific verbs makes clear that the cleanup phrase (“otherwise disturb”) is limited to conduct that involves direct interaction with the animals.  But in the absence of a laundry list followed by a catchall, it is hard to see why the <em>ejusdem</em> canon fits.  <em>Ali </em>v.<em> Federal Bureau of Prisons</em>, <a aria-label=\"552 U. S. 214\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/552/214\">552 U.&nbsp;S. 214</a>, 225 (2008) (“The absence of a list of specific items undercuts the inference embodied in <em>ejusdem generis</em> that Congress remained focused on the common attribute when it used the catchall phrase”).  And §1512(c) does not follow the laundry-list-plus-catchall pattern.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Court’s football example is only slightly better.  As a refresher:</p>\n<p class=\"bqonly1para jy-both\">“[A] football league might adopt a rule that players must not ‘grab, twist, or pull a facemask, helmet, or other equipment with the intent to injure a player, or otherwise attack, assault, or harm any player.’  If a linebacker shouts insults at the quarterback and hurts his feelings, has the linebacker nonetheless followed the rule?  Of course he has.  The examples of prohibited actions all concern dangerous physical conduct that might inflict bodily harm; trash talk is simply not of that kind.”  <em>Ante</em>, at 6.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">Put aside that it is hard to imagine anyone describing “trash talk” as inflicting an “injury” or “harming” a player in a football game.  The league rule plainly forecloses the possibility.  Consistent with the <em>noscitur</em> canon, “harm” takes its meaning from its companions “attack” and “assault.”  And while the Court tries to track §1512(c)’s structure by adding an extra intent clause, the two clauses in its example are still tightly focused on actions directed at the <em>player</em>.  (After all, who is wearing the facemask, helmet, or other equipment?)  Given that shared theme, it is easy to understand that the first clause’s focus on physical conduct limits the (only slightly) more general clause.  But §1512(c)’s subsections are not so closely related—(c)(1) focuses specifically on objects in a proceeding, and (c)(2) broadens the lens to the proceeding itself.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Consider a rule that actually mirrors §1512(c):</p>\n<p class=\"bqbegin jy-both\">“Any player who:</p>\n<p class=\"bqpara jy-both\"> “(1) punches, chokes, or kicks an opposing player with the intent to remove him from the game; or</p>\n<p class=\"bqpara jy-both\"> “(2) otherwise interrupts, hinders, or interferes with &nbsp;the game,</p>\n<p class=\"bqend jy-both\">“shall be suspended.”</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">While the specific verbs in the first clause involve actions directed at an opposing player, the second clause is a separate prohibition with an entirely different object.  Imagine that, just before the opposing team’s kicker attempts a field goal, players leave the sidelines and storm the field, some tackling referees in the process.  Those players have surely “interrupt[ed], hinder[ed], or interfer[ed] with the game,” even though they have not physically injured any opponent.  <em>This </em>hypothetical, not the Court’s, is analogous to §1512(c)—and it supports the Government’s interpretation.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">2</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The Court next recruits help from <em>Begay</em>, which interprets an “otherwise” clause in the Armed Career Criminal Act.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6; 553 U.&nbsp;S., at 140.  The ACCA defines a “violent felony” as a felony that “is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury.”  <a aria-label=\"18 USC 924 e 2 B ii\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/924#e_2_B_ii\">18 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §924(e)(2)(B)(ii)</a>.  <em>Begay</em> holds that the example crimes limit the catchall clause to “crimes that are roughly similar .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to the examples themselves.”  553 U.&nbsp;S., at 143.  So too here, the Court reasons, the list of crimes in (c)(1) limits the “otherwise” clause in (c)(2).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> But §1512(c) is structured differently than the statute in <em>Begay</em>.  While §1512(c) contains two distinct criminal prohibitions—(c)(1) and (c)(2)—the statutory definition in <em>Begay</em> contained a list of examples followed immediately by a residual clause.  The latter structure more readily supports interpreting the general clause in light of the specifics, much like a statute to which the <em>ejusdem</em> canon would apply.  Moreover, the residual clause at issue in <em>Begay</em> called out for a limiting principle—what is a “serious potential risk of physical injury?”  The breadth itself was a cue that &nbsp;the interpreter should read back to find some limit.  See <em>id</em>., at 142–143.  Subsection (c)(2)’s “otherwise” clause, by contrast, stands on its own.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Postscript: Seven years after <em>Begay</em> was decided, we held ACCA’s residual clause void for vagueness.  <em>Johnson </em>v.<em> United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"576 U. S. 591\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/576/591\">576 U.&nbsp;S. 591</a>, 597 (2015).  So the clause is not only distinguishable, but also a poor model for statutory interpretation.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">3</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The Court argues that “there would have been scant reason for Congress to provide any specific examples” in (c)(1) if (c)(2) covered <em>all</em> forms of obstructive conduct.  <em>Ante</em>, at 8. Conduct like destroying and concealing records “obstructs, influences, or impedes a[n] official proceeding,” so Congress could have enacted just (c)(2) and been done with it.  On the Government’s interpretation, the Court asserts, the second prohibition swallows the first.  If (c)(1) has any function, it must be to cast light (and impose limits) on (c)(2).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> What the Court does <em>not</em> say is that its rewrite also eliminates the need for (c)(1)’s examples.  The Court’s interpretation assumes that Congress used a convoluted, two-step approach to enact a prohibition on “impair[ing] the integrity or availability of records, documents, or other objects for use in an official proceeding.”  So why didn’t Congress just say that?  And if the Court is right about what (c)(2) means, why do we need the specific examples in (c)(1)?  Those acts are already covered.  The problem of (c)(2) subsuming (c)(1) is therefore not unique to my theory.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> It bears emphasis, though, that the broad overlap makes sense, given the statute’s backstory.  When the Enron scandal occurred, Congress (along with the general public) was taken aback to discover that seemingly criminal conduct was actually not a federal crime.  As it then existed, §1512 had a loophole: It imposed liability on those who persuaded <em>others</em> to destroy documents, but not on the people who <em>themselves </em>destroyed documents.<em>  Ante</em>, at 9–10.  Congress enacted §1512(c) to close this “Enron gap.”  Subsection (c)(1) deals with the particular problem at hand—document destruction.  Subsection (c)(2) reflects Congress’s desire to avoid future surprises: It is “a catchall for matters not specifically contemplated—known unknowns.”  <em>Republic of Iraq </em>v.<em> Beaty</em>, <a aria-label=\"556 U. S. 848\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/556/848\">556 U.&nbsp;S. 848</a>, 860 (2009).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> So contrary to the Court’s suggestion, it would not be “peculiar” for (c)(2) to cover conduct “far beyond the document shredding and similar scenarios that prompted the legislation in the first place.”  <em>Ante</em>, at 10.  Enron exposed more than the need to prohibit evidence spoliation—it also exposed the need to close statutory gaps.  And in any event, statutes often reach beyond the “principal evil” that animated them.  <em>Oncale </em>v.<em> Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"523 U. S. 75\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/523/75\">523 U.&nbsp;S. 75</a>, 79 (1998).  That is not grounds for narrowing them, because “it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.”  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">4</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> While the Court insists that (c)(1) limits (c)(2), it cannot seem to settle on the “common attribute” in the first subsection that cabins the second.  See <em>Ali</em>, 552 U.&nbsp;S., at 225.  On one hand, the Court says that “(c)(2) makes it a crime to impair the availability or integrity of <em>records, documents, or objects</em> used in an official proceeding.”  <em>Ante</em>, at 8 (emphasis added).  This “physical evidence” limitation tracks the District Court’s interpretation.  See <em>United States </em>v.<em> Miller</em>, 589 F.&nbsp;Supp. 3d 60, 78 (DC 2022).  On the other hand, the Court says that (c)(2) prohibits “impairing the availability or integrity of <em>other </em>things used in an official proceeding,” such as “witness testimony” or “intangible information.”  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.  This broader “evidence impairment” theory resembles Judge Katsas’s interpretation.  64 F.&nbsp;4th 329, 363 (CADC 2023) (dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; Both formulations are problematic—and not only because both are atextual.  The first, focused solely on physical items, would leave (c)(2) with almost no work to do.  Subsection (c)(1) already prohibits “alter[ing], destroy[ing], mutilat[ing], or conceal[ing]” documents, records, or objects.  This essentially covers the waterfront of acts that impair the integrity or availability of objects.  True, (c)(2) could also encompass “cover[ing] up, falsif[ying], or mak[ing] a false entry in” a record or document.  See <a aria-label=\"18 USC 1519\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1519\">18 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §1519</a>.  But it seems “unlikely” that Congress used the “expansive” language of (c)(2) “to address such narrow concerns.”  64 F.&nbsp;4th, at 344.  The somewhat amorphous “other things” limitation has the benefit of giving (c)(2) a wider berth, but it is unclear how the Court landed on it.  The term does not appear in (c)(1) or in §1512’s surrounding subsections, which refer specifically to records, documents, objects, and testimony.  The “other things” formulation comes from the Court, not Congress.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Court’s uncertainty about the relevant “common attribute” is a tell that Congress did not intend to define (c)(2) by reference to (c)(1).  Indeed, “[h]ad Congress intended to limit [§1512(c)(2)]’s reach” as the Court asserts, it “easily could have written” the catchall to say “otherwise impair the integrity or availability of records, documents, objects, or other things for use in an official proceeding.”  <em>Ali</em>, 552 U.&nbsp;S., at 227; see <em>ante</em>, at 8–9.<a aria-label=\"reference 2 of Barrett Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-2\" id=\"DISSENT_6-2ref\"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a>  It did not, and we should not pretend that it did.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The Court relies on statutory context to “confir[m] that &nbsp;(c)(2) is limited by the scope of (c)(1).”  <em>Ante</em>, at 10.  As the Court sees it, interpreting (c)(2) according to its plain text would render other obstruction provisions, within §1512 and throughout Chapter 73, superfluous.  <em>Ante</em>, at 10–12.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Court exaggerates.  Subsection (c)(2) applies only to conduct that obstructs an “official proceeding.”  The Court highlights several provisions that cover obstruction of <em>investigations</em>.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <a aria-label=\"18 USC\" href=\"/uscode/text/18\">18</a> U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §§<a aria-label=\"18 USC 1510 a\" href=\"/uscode/text/18/1510#a\">1510(a)</a>, <a aria-label=\"18 USC 1511 a\" href=\"/uscode/text/18/1511#a\">1511(a)</a>, <a aria-label=\"18 USC 1516\" href=\"/uscode/text/18/1516\">1516</a>, <a aria-label=\"18 USC 1517\" href=\"/uscode/text/18/1517\">1517</a>, <a aria-label=\"18 USC 1518\" href=\"/uscode/text/18/1518\">1518</a>, <a aria-label=\"18 USC 1519\" href=\"/uscode/text/18/1519\">1519</a>.  The circuits have held that criminal investigations do not qualify as “official proceedings.”  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>United States </em>v.<em> Ermoian</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/752_F.3d_1165\">752 F.&nbsp;3d 1165</a>, 1172 (CA9 2013); <em>United States </em>v.<em> Ramos</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/537_F.3d_439\">537 F.&nbsp;3d 439</a>, 463 (CA5 2008).  Likewise, not every provision in §1512 relates to an official proceeding; instead, several target the obstruction of communications to judges and law enforcement about the commission of federal offenses.  <a aria-label=\"18 USC 1512 a 1 C\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1512#a_1_C\">18 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §§1512(a)(1)(C)</a>, (a)(2)(C), (b)(3), (d)(1)(2).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Court responds by stressing that for purposes of §1512, “an official proceeding need not be pending or about to be instituted.”  §1512(f&nbsp;)(1); <em>ante</em>, at 13.  Because obstruction of investigations or communications could end up obstructing the initiation of a future official proceeding, the Court reasons that (c)(2) may still swallow those other provisions.  But we have previously construed federal obstruction offenses similar to §1512(c) to require a tighter link between the obstructive conduct and the relevant proceeding.  Under the “nexus” requirement, the defendant’s conduct must have a “relationship in time, causation, or logic” with the proceeding.  <em>Aguilar</em>, 515 U.&nbsp;S., at 599 (adopting nexus requirement for §1503’s omnibus clause).  And the defendant must act in “contemplation” of a “particular official proceeding.”  <em>Arthur Andersen LLP </em>v.<em> United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"544 U. S. 696\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/544/696\">544 U.&nbsp;S. 696</a>, 708 (2005) (adopting nexus requirement for §1512(b)(2)).  The circuits have unanimously applied this requirement to §1512(c).  See <em>United States </em>v.<em> Young</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/916_F.3d_368\">916 F.&nbsp;3d 368</a>, 386 (CA4 2019) (collecting cases).  This element &nbsp;eliminates much of the overlap that the Court perceives between (c)(2) and the provisions that do not require an “official proceeding.”</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Moreover, §§1512(a)(1)(A) and (d)(1) prohibit preventing the mere attendance of any person in an official proceeding.  Preventing attendance will not always have the effect of obstructing, influencing, or impeding the proceeding.  And §1512(d)(1) makes it a crime to <em>intentionally</em> harass someone and thereby dissuade her from testifying in an official proceeding.  In contrast to (c)(2), this provision—which carries a significantly lower maximum penalty—does not require a defendant to act “corruptly.”</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This is not to deny that (c)(2)—if allowed its broad, ordinary meaning—overlaps with several offenses in Chapter 73.  See <em>ante</em>, at 10–11.  Even so, (c)(2) still leaves a healthy amount of work for other obstruction offenses.  And besides, “substantial” overlap “is not uncommon in criminal statutes.”  <em>Loughrin </em>v.<em> United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"573 U. S. 351\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/573/351\">573 U.&nbsp;S. 351</a>, 358, n.&nbsp;4 (2014); see also <em>Hubbard </em>v.<em> United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"514 U. S. 695\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/514/695\">514 U.&nbsp;S. 695</a>, 714, n.&nbsp;14 (1995) (opinion of Stevens, J.).  “The mere fact that two federal criminal statutes criminalize similar conduct says little about the scope of either.”  <em>Pasquantino </em>v.<em> United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"544 U. S. 349\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/544/349\">544 U.&nbsp;S. 349</a>, 358, n.&nbsp;4 (2005).  That is especially true here, because Congress enacted (c)(2) <em>after </em>it had already enacted other subsections of §1512, as well as obstruction offenses like §§1503 and 1505.  The redundancy argument would have more force if (c)(2) “render[ed] superfluous an entire provision passed in proximity as part of the <em>same Act</em>.”  <em>Yates </em>v.<em> United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"574 U. S. 528\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/574/528\">574 U.&nbsp;S. 528</a>, 543 (2015) (plurality opinion) (emphasis added).  As it stands, the canon against surplusage does not provide any reason to artificially narrow (c)(2)’s scope.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In any event, the Court’s formulation does not begin to cure the statutory overlap.  Killing a person with the intent to prevent the production of a record in an official proceeding constitutes conduct that impairs the availability of a &nbsp;record for an official proceeding.  <a aria-label=\"18 USC 1512 a 1 B\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1512#a_1_B\">18 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §1512(a)(1)(B)</a>.  Using physical force against a person to influence testimony in an official proceeding counts as impairing the integrity of “other things” used in an official proceeding.  §1512(a)(2)(A).  And impairing the availability or integrity of documents for use in an official proceeding will often “influenc[e], obstruc[t], or imped[e] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the due administration of justice.”  §1503(a); see also §1515(a)(1)(A) (“&nbsp;‘official proceeding’&nbsp;” includes “a proceeding before a judge or court of the United States”).  Examples abound.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., §§1505, 1512(a)(1)(A), (a)(2)(B), (b)(1), (b)(2), (d)(1).  “[T]he canon against surplusage merely favors that interpretation which <em>avoids</em> surplusage”—and on that score, the Court’s interpretation fares no better than mine.  <em>Freeman </em>v.<em> Quicken Loans, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"566 U. S. 624\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/566/624\">566 U.&nbsp;S. 624</a>, 635 (2012).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In fact, the broader statutory context works <em>against</em> the Court’s interpretation.  Congress did not select the verbs “obstruct,” “influence,” and “impede” at random.  Those words were already in §1503, which prohibits “corruptly or by threats or force, or by any threatening letter or communication, influenc[ing], obstruct[ing], or imped[ing] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the due administration of justice.”  We have described this “&nbsp;‘Omnibus Clause’&nbsp;” as a “catchall,” because it follows several specific proscriptions against coercive behavior toward jurors and court officers.  <em>Aguilar</em>, 515 U.&nbsp;S., at 598.  Courts have routinely declined to “rea[d] the omnibus clause” as limited to “acts similar in manner to those prescribed by the statute’s specific language.”  <em>United States </em>v.<em> Howard</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/569_F.2d_1331\">569 F.&nbsp;2d 1331</a>, 1333, 1335 (CA5 1978) (collecting cases).  And Justice Scalia agreed that <em>ejusdem generis</em> did not apply to limit the Omnibus Clause, “one of the several distinct and independent prohibitions contained in §1503 that share only the word ‘Whoever,’ which begins the statute, and the penalty provision which ends it.”  <em>Aguilar</em>, 515 U.&nbsp;S., at 615 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Section 1512(c) follows the very same pattern.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">&nbsp;C</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The Court concludes with an appeal to consequences: Construing (c)(2) broadly would “expos[e] activists and lobbyists alike to decades in prison.”  <em>Ante</em>, at 14.  This fear is overstated.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> To begin with, the Court ignores that (c)(2) requires proof that a defendant acted “corruptly.”  The meaning of this term is unsettled, but all of its possible definitions limit the scope of liability.  On one proposed interpretation, a defendant acts corruptly by “&nbsp;‘us[ing] unlawful means, or act[ing] with an unlawful purpose, or both.’&nbsp;”  <em>United States </em>v.<em> Robertson</em>, 103 F.&nbsp;4th 1, 8 (CADC 2023) (approving jury instructions for (c)(2)).  On another, a defendant acts “corruptly” if he “act[s] ‘with an intent to procure an unlawful benefit either for himself or for some other person.’&nbsp;”  64 F.&nbsp;4th, at 352 (Walker, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (quoting <em>Marinello</em>, 584 U.&nbsp;S., at 21; alterations omitted).  Under either, the “corruptly” element should screen out innocent activists and lobbyists who engage in lawful activity.  And if not, those defendants can bring as-applied <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> challenges.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Court also emphasizes (c)(2)’s 20-year maximum penalty.  <em>Ante</em>, at 14–15.  But it simultaneously “glosses over the absence of any prescribed minimum.”  <em>Yates</em>, 574 U.&nbsp;S., at 569 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Kagan</span>, J., dissenting).  “Congress presumably enacts laws with high maximums and no minimums when it thinks the prohibited conduct may run the gamut from major to minor.”  <em>Ibid</em>.  Indeed, given the breadth of its terms, (c)(2) naturally encompasses actions that range in severity.  Congress presumably trusted District Courts to impose sentences commensurate with the defendant’s particular conduct.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">*  *  *</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> There is no getting around it: Section 1512(c)(2) is an expansive statute.  Yet Congress, not this Court, weighs the &nbsp;“pros and cons of whether a statute should sweep broadly or narrowly.”  <em>United States </em>v.<em> Rodgers</em>, <a aria-label=\"466 U. S. 475\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/466/475\">466 U.&nbsp;S. 475</a>, 484 (1984).  Once Congress has set the outer bounds of liability, the Executive Branch has the discretion to select particular cases to prosecute within those boundaries.  By atextually narrowing §1512(c)(2), the Court has failed to respect the prerogatives of the political branches.  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 15.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<h3 class=\"fnheader\">Notes</h3>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_6-1\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Barrett Dissent at reference 1\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-1ref\">1</a> &nbsp;The D.

Like many local governments across the Nation, Grants Pass has public-camping laws that restrict encampments on public property.  The Grants Pass Municipal Code prohibits activities such as camping on public property or parking overnight in the city’s parks.  See §§5.61.030, 6.46.090(A)–(B).  Initial violations can trigger a fine, while multiple violations can result in imprisonment. In a prior decision, <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Boise</em>, the Ninth Circuit held that the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a>’s Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause bars cities from enforcing public-camping ordinances like these against homeless individuals whenever the number of homeless individuals in a jurisdiction exceeds the number of “practically available” shelter beds.  <a href=\"/rio/citation/920_F.3d_584\">920 F.&nbsp;3d 584</a>, 617.  After <em>Martin</em>, suits against Western cities like Grants Pass proliferated. </p>\n<p class=\"sylct-d jy-both\">   Plaintiffs (respondents here) filed a putative class action on behalf of homeless people living in Grants Pass, claiming that the city’s ordinances against public camping violated the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a>.  The district court certified the class and entered a <em>Martin </em>injunction prohibiting Grants Pass from enforcing its laws against homeless individuals in the city.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 182a–183a.  Applying <em>Martin</em>’s reasoning, the district court found everyone without shelter in Grants Pass was “involuntarily homeless” because the city’s total homeless population outnumbered its “practically available” shelter beds.  App. &nbsp;to Pet. for Cert. 179a, 216a.  The beds at Grants Pass’s charity-run shelter did not qualify as “available” in part because that shelter has rules requiring residents to abstain from smoking and to attend religious services.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 179a–180a.  A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court’s <em>Martin </em>injunction in relevant part.  72 F.&nbsp;4th 868, 874–896.  Grants Pass filed a petition for certiorari.  Many States, cities, and counties from across the Ninth Circuit urged the Court to grant review to assess <em>Martin</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-e jy-both\"><em>Held</em>:&nbsp;The enforcement of generally applicable laws regulating camping on public property does not constitute “cruel and unusual punishment” prohibited by the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a>.  Pp. 15–35.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">  (a)&nbsp;The <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a>’s Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause “has always been considered, and properly so, to be directed at the method or kind of punishment” a government may “impos[e] for the violation of criminal statutes.”  <em>Powell</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a aria-label=\"392 U. S. 514\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/392/514\">392 U. S. 514</a>, 531–532 (plurality opinion).  It was adopted to ensure that the new Nation would never resort to certain “formerly tolerated” punishments considered “cruel” because they were calculated to “&nbsp;‘superad[d]’&nbsp;”  “&nbsp;‘terror, pain, or disgrace,’&nbsp;” and considered “unusual” because, by the time of the Amendment’s adoption, they had “long fallen out of use.”  <em>Bucklew</em> v.<em> Precythe</em>, 587 U.&nbsp;S 119, 130.  All that would seem to make the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a> a poor foundation on which to rest the kind of decree the plaintiffs seek in this case and the Ninth Circuit has endorsed since <em>Martin</em>.  The Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause focuses on the question what “method or kind of punishment” a government may impose after a criminal conviction, not on the question whether a government may criminalize particular behavior in the first place.  <em>Powell</em>, 392 U. S., at 531–532.  </p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">  The Court cannot say that the punishments Grants Pass imposes here qualify as cruel and unusual.  The city imposes only limited fines for first-time offenders, an order temporarily barring an individual from camping in a public park for repeat offenders, and a maximum sentence of 30 days in jail for those who later violate an order.  See Ore. Rev. Stat. §§164.245, 161.615(3).  Such punishments do not qualify as cruel because they are not designed to “superad[d]” “terror, pain, or disgrace.”  <em>Bucklew</em>, 587 U. S., at 130 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Nor are they unusual, because similarly limited fines and jail terms have been and remain among “the usual mode[s]” for punishing criminal offenses throughout the country.  <em>Pervear</em> v. <em>Commonwealth</em>, 5 Wall. 475, 480.  Indeed, cities and States across the country have long employed similar punishments for similar offenses.  Pp. 15–17.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">  (b)&nbsp;Plaintiffs do not meaningfully dispute that, on its face, the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause does not speak to questions like &nbsp;what a State may criminalize or how it may go about securing a conviction.  Like the Ninth Circuit in <em>Martin</em>, plaintiffs point to <em>Robinson</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a aria-label=\"370 U. S. 660\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/370/660\">370 U. S. 660</a>, as a notable exception.  In <em>Robinson</em>, the Court held that under the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, California could not enforce a law providing that “‘[n]o person shall .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. be addicted to the use of narcotics.’”  <em>Id</em>., at 660, n 1.  While California could not make “the ‘status’ of narcotic addiction a criminal offense,” <em>id</em>., at 666, the Court emphasized that it did not mean to cast doubt on the States’ “broad power” to prohibit behavior even by those, like the defendant, who suffer from addiction.  <em>Id</em>., at 664, 667–668.  The problem, as the Court saw it, was that California’s law made the status of being an addict a crime.  <em>Id</em>.<em>,</em> at 666–667  The Court read the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause (in a way unprecedented in 1962) to impose a limit on what a State may criminalize.  In dissent, Justice White lamented that the majority had embraced an “application of ‘cruel and unusual punishment’ so novel that” it could not possibly be “ascribe[d] to the Framers of the Constitution.”  370 U.&nbsp;S., at 689.  The Court has not applied <em>Robinson </em>in that way since.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">  Whatever its persuasive force as an interpretation of the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a>, <em>Robinson</em> cannot sustain the Ninth Circuit’s <em>Martin</em> project.  <em>Robinson</em> expressly recognized the “broad power” States enjoy over the substance of their criminal laws, stressing that they may criminalize knowing or intentional drug use even by those suffering from addiction.  370 U.&nbsp;S., at 664, 666.  The Court held that California’s statute offended the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a> only because it criminalized addiction as a status.  <em>Ibid</em>.  </p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">  Grants Pass’s public-camping ordinances do not criminalize status.  The public-camping laws prohibit actions undertaken by any person, regardless of status.  It makes no difference whether the charged defendant is currently a person experiencing homelessness, a backpacker on vacation, or a student who abandons his dorm room to camp out in protest on the lawn of a municipal building.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 159.  Because the public-camping laws in this case do not criminalize status, <em>Robinson</em> is not implicated.  Pp. 17–21.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">  (c)&nbsp;Plaintiffs insist the Court should extend <em>Robinson</em> to prohibit the enforcement of laws that proscribe certain acts that are in some sense “involuntary,” because some homeless individuals cannot help but do what the law forbids.  See Brief for Respondents 24–25, 29, 32.  The Ninth Circuit pursued this line of thinking below and in <em>Martin</em>, but this Court already rejected it in <em>Powell</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a aria-label=\"392 U. S. 514\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/392/514\">392 U. S. 514</a>.  In <em>Powell</em>, the Court confronted a defendant who had been convicted under a Texas statute making it a crime to “ ‘get drunk or be found in a state of intoxication in any public place.’ ”  <em>Id</em>., at 517 (plurality opinion).  Like the plaintiffs here, Powell argued that his drunkenness was &nbsp;an “‘involuntary’” byproduct of his status as an alcoholic.  <em>Id</em>., at 533.  The Court did not agree that Texas’s law effectively criminalized Powell’s status as an alcoholic.  Writing for a plurality, Justice Marshall observed that <em>Robinson</em>’s “very small” intrusion “into the substantive criminal law” prevents States only from enforcing laws that criminalize “a mere status.”  <em>Id</em>., at 532–533<em>.  </em>It does nothing to curtail a State’s authority to secure a conviction when “the accused has committed some act . . . society has an interest in preventing.”  <em>Id</em>., at 533.  That remains true, Justice Marshall continued, even if the defendant’s conduct might, “in some sense” be described as “ ‘involuntary’ or ‘occasioned by’” a particular status.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">  This case is no different.  Just as in <em>Powell</em>, plaintiffs here seek to extend <em>Robinson</em>’s rule beyond laws addressing “mere status” to laws addressing actions that, even if undertaken with the requisite <em>mens rea</em>, might “in some sense” qualify as “ ‘involuntary.’ ”  And as in <em>Powell</em>, the Court can find nothing in the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a> permitting that course.  Instead, a variety of other legal doctrines and constitutional provisions work to protect those in the criminal justice system from a conviction.  Pp. 21–24.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">  (d)&nbsp;<em>Powell</em> not only declined to extend <em>Robinson</em> to “involuntary” acts but also stressed the dangers of doing so.  Extending <em>Robinson</em> to cover involuntary acts would, Justice Marshall observed,  effectively “impe[l]” this Court “into defining” something akin to a new “insanity test in constitutional terms.”  <em>Powell</em>, 392 U.&nbsp;S., at 536.  That is because an individual like the defendant in <em>Powell</em> does not dispute that he has committed an otherwise criminal act with the requisite <em>mens rea</em>, yet he seeks to be excused from “moral accountability” because of his “‘condition. ’”  <em>Id</em>., at 535–536.  Instead, Justice Marshall reasoned, such matters should be left for resolution through the democratic process, and not by “freez[ing]” any particular, judicially preferred approach “into a rigid constitutional mold.”  <em>Id</em>., at 537.  The Court echoed that last point in <em>Kahler</em> v. <em>Kansas</em>, <a aria-label=\"589 U. S. 271\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/589/271\">589 U.&nbsp;S. 271</a>, in which the Court stressed that questions about whether an individual who committed a proscribed act with the requisite mental state should be “reliev[ed of] responsibility,” <em>id</em>., at 283, due to a lack of “moral culpability,” <em>id</em>., at 286, are generally best resolved by the people and their elected representatives.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">  Though doubtless well intended, the Ninth Circuit’s <em>Martin</em> experiment defied these lessons.  Answers to questions such as what constitutes “involuntarily” homelessness or when a shelter is “practically available” cannot be found in the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause.  Nor do federal judges enjoy any special competence to provide them.  Cities across the West report that the Ninth Circuit’s involun&nbsp;tariness test has created intolerable uncertainty for them.  By extending <em>Robinson</em> beyond the narrow class of pure status crimes, the Ninth Circuit has created a right that has proven “impossible” for judges to delineate except “by fiat.”  <em>Powell</em>, 392 U.&nbsp;S., at 534.  As Justice Marshall anticipated in <em>Powell</em>, the Ninth Circuit’s rules have produced confusion and they have interfered with “essential considerations of federalism,” by taking from the people and their elected leaders difficult questions traditionally “thought to be the[ir] province.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 535–536.  Pp. 24–34.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">  (e)&nbsp;Homelessness is complex.  Its causes are many.  So may be the public policy responses required to address it.  The question this case presents is whether the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a> grants federal judges primary responsibility for assessing those causes and devising those responses.  A handful of federal judges cannot begin to “match” the collective wisdom the American people possess in deciding “how best to handle” a pressing social question like homelessness.  <em>Robinson</em>, 370 U. S., at 689 (White, J., dissenting).  The Constitution’s <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a> serves many important functions, but it does not authorize federal judges to wrest those rights and responsibilities from the American people and in their place dictate this Nation’s homelessness policy.

The causes are varied and complex, the appropriate public policy responses perhaps no less so.  Like many local governments, the city of Grants Pass, Oregon, has pursued a multifaceted approach.  Recently, it adopted various policies aimed at “protecting the rights, dignity[,] and private property of the homeless.”  App. 152.  It appointed a “homeless community liaison” officer charged with ensuring the homeless receive information about “assistance programs and other resources” available to them through the city and its local shelter.  <em>Id</em>., at 152–153; Brief for Grants Pass Gospel Rescue Mission as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 2–3.  And it adopted certain restrictions against encampments on public property.  App. 155–156.  The Ninth Circuit, however, held that the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a>’s Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause barred that last measure.  With support from States and cities across the country, Grants Pass urged this Court to review the Ninth Circuit’s decision.  We take up that task now.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">&nbsp;I</h3>\n<h4 class=\"jy-center\">A</h4>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Some suggest that homelessness may be the “defining public health and safety crisis in the western United States” today.  72 F.&nbsp;4th 868, 934 (CA9 2023) (Smith, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).  According to the federal government, homelessness in this country has reached its highest levels since the government began reporting data on the subject in 2007.  Dept. of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Community Planning &amp; Development, T. de Sousa et&nbsp;al., The 2023 Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR) to Congress 2–3 (2023).  California alone is home to around half of those in this Nation living without shelter on a given night.  <em>Id</em>., at 30.  And each of the five States with the highest rates of unsheltered homelessness in the country—California, Oregon, Hawaii, Arizona, and Nevada—lies in the American West.  <em>Id</em>., at 17.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Those experiencing homelessness may be as diverse as the Nation itself—they are young and old and belong to all races and creeds.  People become homeless for a variety of reasons, too, many beyond their control.  Some have been affected by economic conditions, rising housing costs, or natural disasters.  <em>Id</em>., at 37; see Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 2–3.  Some have been forced from their homes to escape domestic violence and other forms of exploitation.  <em>Ibid.</em>  And still others struggle with drug addiction and mental illness.  By one estimate, perhaps 78 percent of the unsheltered suffer from mental-health issues, while 75 percent struggle with substance abuse.  See J. Rountree, N. Hess, &amp; A. Lyke, Health Conditions Among Unsheltered Adults in the U.&nbsp;S., Calif. Policy Lab, Policy Brief 5 (2019).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Those living without shelter often live together.  L. Dunton et&nbsp;al., Dept. of Housing and Urban Development, &nbsp;Office of Policy Development &amp; Research, Exploring Homelessness Among People Living in Encampments and Associated Cost 1 (2020) (2020 HUD Report).  As the number of homeless individuals has grown, the number of homeless encampments across the country has increased as well, “in numbers not seen in almost a century.”<em>  Ibid.</em>  The unsheltered may coalesce in these encampments for a range of reasons.  Some value the “freedom” encampment living provides compared with submitting to the rules shelters impose.  Dept. of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Policy Development and Research, R. Cohen, W. Yetvin, &amp; J. Khadduri, Understanding Encampments of People Experiencing Homelessness and Community Responses 5 (2019).  Others report that encampments offer a “sense of community.”  <em>Id</em>., at 7<em>.</em>  And still others may seek them out for “dependable access to illegal drugs.”  <em>Ibid.</em>  In brief, the reasons why someone will go without shelter on a given night vary widely by the person and by the day.  See <em>ibid</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> As the number and size of these encampments have grown, so have the challenges they can pose for the homeless and others.  We are told, for example, that the “exponential increase in .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. encampments in recent years has resulted in an increase in crimes both against the homeless and by the homeless.”  Brief for California State Sheriffs’ Associations et&nbsp;al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 21 (California Sheriffs Brief&nbsp;).  California’s Governor reports that encampment inhabitants face heightened risks of “sexual assault” and “subjugation to sex work.”  Brief for California Governor G. Newsom as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 11 (California Governor Brief&nbsp;).  And by one estimate, more than 40 percent of the shootings in Seattle in early 2022 were linked to homeless encampments.  Brief for Washington State Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> on Pet. for Cert. 10 (Washington Sheriffs Brief&nbsp;).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Other challenges have arisen as well.  Some city officials indicate that encampments facilitate the distribution of &nbsp;drugs like heroin and fentanyl, which have claimed the lives of so many Americans in recent years.  Brief for Office of the San Diego County District Attorney as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 17–19.  Without running water or proper sanitation facilities, too, diseases can sometimes spread in encampments and beyond them.  Various States say that they have seen typhus, shigella, trench fever, and other diseases reemerge on their city streets.  California Governor Brief 12; Brief for Idaho et&nbsp;al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 7 (States Brief&nbsp;).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Nor do problems like these affect everyone equally.  Often, encampments are found in a city’s “poorest and most vulnerable neighborhoods.”  Brief for City and County of San Francisco et&nbsp;al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> on Pet. for Cert. 5 (San Francisco Cert. Brief&nbsp;); see also 2020 HUD Report 9.  With encampments dotting neighborhood sidewalks, adults and children in these communities are sometimes forced to navigate around used needles, human waste, and other hazards to make their way to school, the grocery store, or work.  San Francisco Cert. Brief 5; States Brief 8; California Governor Brief 11–12.  Those with physical disabilities report this can pose a special challenge for them, as they may lack the mobility to maneuver safely around the encampments.  San Francisco Cert. Brief 5; see also Brief for Tiana Tozer et&nbsp;al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 1–6 (Tozer Brief&nbsp;).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Communities of all sizes are grappling with how best to address challenges like these.  As they have throughout the Nation’s history, charitable organizations “serve as the backbone of the emergency shelter system in this country,” accounting for roughly 40 percent of the country’s shelter beds for single adults on a given night.  See National Alliance To End Homelessness, Faith-Based Organizations:  Fundamental Partners in Ending Homelessness 1 (2017).  Many private organizations, city officials, and States have worked, as well, to increase the availability of affordable housing in order to provide more permanent shelter for those in need.  See Brief for Local Government Legal Center &nbsp;et&nbsp;al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 4, 32 (Cities Brief&nbsp;).  But many, too, have come to the conclusion that, as they put it, “[j]ust building more shelter beds and public housing options is almost certainly not the answer by itself.”  <em>Id</em>., at 11.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> As many cities see it, even as they have expanded shelter capacity and other public services, their unsheltered populations have continued to grow.  <em>Id</em>., at 9–11.  The city of Seattle, for example, reports that roughly 60 percent of its offers of shelter have been rejected in a recent year.  See <em>id</em>., at 28, and n.&nbsp;26.  Officials in Portland, Oregon, indicate that, between April 2022 and January 2024, over 70 percent of their approximately 3,500 offers of shelter beds to homeless individuals were declined.  Brief for League of Oregon Cities et&nbsp;al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 5 (Oregon Cities Brief&nbsp;).  Other cities tell us that “the vast majority of their homeless populations are not actively seeking shelter and refuse all services.”  Brief for Thirteen California Cities as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 3.  Surveys cited by the Department of Justice suggest that only “25–41 percent” of “homeless encampment residents” “willingly” accept offers of shelter beds.  See Dept. of Justice, Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, S. Chamard, Homeless Encampments 36 (2010).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The reasons why the unsheltered sometimes reject offers of assistance may themselves be many and complex.  Some may reject shelter because accepting it would take them further from family and local ties.  See Brief for 57 Social Scientists as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 20.  Some may decline offers of assistance because of concerns for their safety or the rules some shelters impose regarding curfews, drug use, or religious practices.  <em>Id.</em>, at 22; see Cities Brief 29.  Other factors may also be at play.  But whatever the causes, local governments say, this dynamic significantly complicates their efforts to address the challenges of homelessness.  See <em>id</em>., at 11.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Rather than focus on a single policy to meet the chal&nbsp;lenges associated with homelessness, many States and cities have pursued a range of policies and programs.  See 2020 HUD Report 14–20.  Beyond expanding shelter and affordable housing opportunities, some have reinvested in mental-health and substance-abuse treatment programs.  See Brief for California State Association of Counties et&nbsp;al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 20, 25; see also 2020 HUD Report 23.  Some have trained their employees in outreach tactics designed to improve relations between governments and the homeless they serve.  <em>Ibid.</em>  And still others have chosen to pair these efforts with the enforcement of laws that restrict camping in public places, like parks, streets, and sidewalks.  Cities Brief 11.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Laws like those are commonplace.  By one count, “a majority of cities have laws restricting camping in public spaces,” and nearly forty percent “have one or more laws prohibiting camping citywide.”  See Brief for Western Regional Advocacy Project as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 7, n.&nbsp;15 (emphasis deleted).  Some have argued that the enforcement of these laws can create a “revolving door that circulates individuals experiencing homelessness from the street to the criminal justice system and back.”  U.&nbsp;S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, Searching Out Solutions 6 (2012).  But many cities take a different view.  According to the National League of Cities (a group that represents more than 19,000 American cities and towns), the National Association of Counties (which represents the Nation’s 3,069 counties) and others across the American West, these public-camping regulations are not usually deployed as a front-line response “to criminalize homelessness.”  Cities Brief 11.  Instead, they are used to provide city employees with the legal authority to address “encampments that pose significant health and safety risks” and to encourage their inhabitants to accept other alternatives like shelters, drug treatment programs, and mental-health facilities.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; Cities are not alone in pursuing this approach.  The federal government also restricts “the storage of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sleeping bags,” as well as other “sleeping activities,” on park lands.  <a aria-label=\"36 CFR\" href=\"/cfr/text/36\">36</a> CFR §§7.96(i), (j)(1) (2023).  And it, too, has exercised that authority to clear certain “dangerous” encampments.  National Park Service, Record of Determination for Clearing the Unsheltered Encampment at McPherson Square and Temporary Park Closure for Rehabilitation (Feb. 13, 2023).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Different governments may use these laws in different ways and to varying degrees.  See Cities Brief 11.  But many broadly agree that “policymakers need access to the full panoply of tools in the policy toolbox” to “tackle the complicated issues of housing and homelessness.”  California Governor Brief 16; accord, Cities Brief 11; Oregon Cities Brief 17.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Five years ago, the U.&nbsp;S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit took one of those tools off the table.  In <em>Martin</em> v. <em>Boise</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/920_F.3d_584\">920 F.&nbsp;3d 584</a> (2019), that court considered a public-camping ordinance in Boise, Idaho, that made it a misdemeanor to use “streets, sidewalks, parks, or public places” for “camping.”  <em>Id</em>., at 603 (internal quotation marks omitted).  According to the Ninth Circuit, the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a>’s Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause barred Boise from enforcing its public-camping ordinance against homeless individuals who lacked “access to alternative shelter.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 615.  That “access” was lacking, the court said, whenever “&nbsp;‘there is a greater number of homeless individuals in a jurisdiction than the number of available beds in shelters.’&nbsp;”  <em>Id.</em>, at 617 (alterations omitted).  According to the Ninth Circuit, nearly three quarters of Boise’s shelter beds were not “practically available” because the city’s charitable shelters had a “religious atmosphere.”  <em>Id</em>., at 609–610, 618.  Boise was thus enjoined from enforcing &nbsp;its camping laws against the plaintiffs.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> No other circuit has followed <em>Martin</em>’s lead with respect to public-camping laws.  Nor did the decision go unremarked within the Ninth Circuit.  When the full court denied rehearing en banc, several judges wrote separately to note their dissent.  In one statement, Judge Bennett argued that <em>Martin</em> was inconsistent with the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause.  That provision, Judge Bennett contended, prohibits certain methods of punishment a government may impose after a criminal conviction, but it does not “impose [any] substantive limits on what conduct a state may criminalize.”  <a aria-label=\"920 F.3d 599\" href=\"/rio/citation/920_F.3d_599\">920 F.&nbsp;3d, at 599</a>–602.  In another statement, Judge Smith lamented that <em>Martin </em>had “shackle[d] the hands of public officials trying to redress the serious societal concern of homelessness.”  <em>Id</em>., at 590.  He predicted the decision would “wrea[k] havoc on local governments, residents, and businesses” across the American West.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> After <em>Martin</em>, similar suits proliferated against Western cities within the Ninth Circuit.  As Judge Smith put it, “[i]f one picks up a map of the western United States and points to a city that appears on it, there is a good chance that city has already faced” a judicial injunction based on <em>Martin</em> or the threat of one “in the few short years since [the Ninth Circuit] initiated its <em>Martin </em>experiment.”  72 F.&nbsp;4th, at 940; see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Boyd</em> v. <em>San Rafael</em>, 2023 WL 7283885, *1–*2 (ND Cal., Nov. 2, 2023); <em>Fund for Empowerment</em> v. <em>Phoenix</em>, 646 F.&nbsp;Supp. 3d 1117, 1132 (Ariz. 2022); <em>Warren</em> v. <em>Chico</em>, 2021 WL 2894648, *3 (ED Cal., July 8, 2021).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Consider San Francisco, where each night thousands sleep “in tents and other makeshift structures.”  Brief for City and County of San Francisco et&nbsp;al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 8 (San Francisco Brief&nbsp;).  Applying <em>Martin</em>, a district court entered an injunction barring the city from enforcing “laws and ordinances to prohibit involuntarily homeless individuals from sitting, lying, or sleeping on public property.”  <em>Coalition on Homelessness</em> v. <em>San Francisco</em>, 647 F.&nbsp;Supp. 3d &nbsp;806, 841 (ND Cal. 2022).  That “misapplication of this Court’s <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a> precedents,” the Mayor tells us, has “severely constrained San Francisco’s ability to address the homelessness crisis.”  San Francisco Brief 7.  The city “uses enforcement of its laws prohibiting camping” not to criminalize homelessness, but “as one important tool among others to encourage individuals experiencing homelessness to accept services and to help ensure safe and accessible sidewalks and public spaces.”  <em>Id</em>., at 7–8.  Judicial intervention restricting the use of that tool, the Mayor continues, “has led to painful results on the streets and in neighborhoods.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 8.  “San Francisco has seen over half of its offers of shelter and services rejected by unhoused individuals, who often cite” the <em>Martin</em> order against the city “as their justification to permanently occupy and block public sidewalks.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 8–9.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> An exceptionally large number of cities and States have filed briefs in this Court reporting experiences like San Francisco’s.  In the judgment of many of them, the Ninth Circuit has inappropriately “limit[ed] the tools available to local governments for tackling [what is a] complex and difficult human issue.”  Oregon Cities Brief 2.  The threat of <em>Martin </em>injunctions, they say, has “paralyze[d]” even commonsense and good-faith efforts at addressing homelessness.  Brief for City of Phoenix et&nbsp;al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 36 (Phoenix Brief&nbsp;).  The Ninth Circuit’s intervention, they insist, has prevented local governments from pursuing “effective solutions to this humanitarian crisis while simultaneously protecting the remaining community’s right to safely enjoy public spaces.”  Brief for International Municipal Lawyers Association et&nbsp;al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> on Pet. for Cert. 27 (Cities Cert. Brief&nbsp;); States Brief 11 (“State and local governments in the Ninth Circuit have attempted a variety of solutions to address the problems that public encampments inflict on their communities,” only to have those “efforts .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shut down by federal courts”).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; Many cities further report that, rather than help alleviate the homelessness crisis, <em>Martin</em> injunctions have inadvertently contributed to it.  The numbers of “[u]nsheltered homelessness,” they represent, have “increased dramatically in the Ninth Circuit since <em>Martin</em>.”  Brief for League of Oregon Cities et&nbsp;al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> on Pet. for Cert. 7 (boldface and capitalization deleted).  And, they say, <em>Martin</em> injunctions have contributed to this trend by “weaken[ing]” the ability of public officials “to persuade persons experiencing homelessness to accept shelter beds and [other] services.”  Brief for Ten California Cities as <em>Amici Curiae</em> on Pet. for Cert. 2.  In Portland, for example, residents report some unsheltered persons “often return within days” of an encampment’s clearing, on the understanding that “<em>Martin</em> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and its progeny prohibit the [c]ity from implementing more efficacious strategies.”  Tozer Brief 5; Washington Sheriffs Brief 14 (<em>Martin</em> divests officers of the “ability to compel [unsheltered] persons to leave encampments and obtain necessary services”).  In short, they say, <em>Martin</em> “make[s] solving this crisis harder.”  Cities Cert. Brief 3.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> All acknowledge “[h]omelessness is a complex and serious social issue that cries out for effective .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. responses.”  <em>Ibid.</em>  But many States and cities believe “it is crucial” for local governments to “have the latitude” to experiment and find effective responses.  <em>Id</em>., at 27; States Brief 13–17.  “Injunctions and the threat of federal litigation,” they insist, “impede this democratic process,” undermine local governments, and do not well serve the homeless or others who live in the Ninth Circuit.  Cities Cert. Brief 27–28.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">C</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The case before us arises from a <em>Martin </em>injunction issued against the city of Grants Pass.  Located on the banks of the Rogue River in southwestern Oregon, the city is home to roughly 38,000 people.  Among them are an estimated 600 individuals who experience homelessness on a given day.<em> </em> &nbsp;72 F.&nbsp;4th, at 874; App. to Pet. for Cert. 167a–168a; 212a–213a.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Like many American cities, Grants Pass has laws restricting camping in public spaces.  Three are relevant here.  The first prohibits sleeping “on public sidewalks, streets, or alleyways.”  Grants Pass Municipal Code §5.61.020(A) (2023); App. to Pet. for Cert. 221a.  The second prohibits “[c]amping” on public property.  §5.61.030; App. to Pet. for Cert. 222a (boldface deleted). Camping is defined as “set[ting] up .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or remain[ing] in or at a campsite,” and a “[c]ampsite” is defined as “any place where bedding, sleeping bag[s], or other material used for bedding purposes, or any stove or fire is placed .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for the purpose of maintaining a temporary place to live.”  §§5.61.010(A)–(B); App. to Pet. for Cert. 221a.  The third prohibits “[c]amping” and “[o]vernight parking” in the city’s parks.  §§6.46.090(A)–(B); 72 F.&nbsp;4th, at 876.  Penalties for violating these ordinances escalate stepwise.  An initial violation may trigger a fine.  §§1.36.010(I)–(J).  Those who receive multiple citations may be subject to an order barring them from city parks for 30 days.  §6.46.350; App. to Pet. for Cert. 174a.  And, in turn, violations of those orders can constitute criminal trespass, punishable by a maximum of 30 days in prison and a $1,250 fine.  Ore. Rev. Stat. §§164.245, 161.615(3), 161.635(1)(c) (2023).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Neither of the named plaintiffs before us has been subjected to an order barring them from city property or to criminal trespass charges.  Perhaps that is because the city has traditionally taken a light-touch approach to enforcement.  The city’s officers are directed “to provide law enforcement services to all members of the community while protecting the rights, dignity[,] and private property of the homeless.”  App. 152, Grants Pass Dept. of Public Safety Policy Manual ¶428.1.1 (Dec. 17, 2018).  Officers are instructed that “[h]omelessness is not a crime.”  <em>Ibid.</em>  And they are “encouraged” to render “aid” and “support” to the &nbsp;homeless whenever possible.  <em>Id</em>., at 153, ¶428.3.<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Gorsuch Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-1\" id=\"OPINION_4-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Still, shortly after the panel decision in <em>Martin</em>, two homeless individuals, Gloria Johnson and John Logan, filed suit challenging the city’s public-camping laws.  App. 37, Third Amended Complaint ¶¶6–7.  They claimed, among other things, that the city’s ordinances violated the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a>’s Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause.  <em>Id</em>., at 51, ¶66.  And they sought to pursue their claim on behalf of a class encompassing “all involuntarily homeless people living in Grants Pass.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 48, ¶52.<a aria-label=\"reference 2 of Gorsuch Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-2\" id=\"OPINION_4-2ref\"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The district court certified the class action and enjoined the city from enforcing its public-camping laws against the homeless.  While Ms. Johnson and Mr. Logan generally sleep in their vehicles, the court held, they could adequately represent the class, for sleeping in a vehicle can sometimes count as unlawful “&nbsp;‘camping’&nbsp;” under the relevant ordinances.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 219a (quoting Grants Pass Municipal Code §5.61.010).  And, the court found, everyone &nbsp;without shelter in Grants Pass was “involuntarily homeless” because the city’s total homeless population outnumbered its “&nbsp;‘practically available’&nbsp;” shelter beds.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 179a, 216a.  In fact, the court ruled, none of the beds at Grants Pass’s charity-run shelter qualified as “available.”  They did not, the court said, both because that shelter offers something closer to transitional housing than “temporary emergency shelter,” and because the shelter has rules requiring residents to abstain from smoking and attend religious services.  <em>Id</em>., at 179a–180a.  The <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a>, the district court thus concluded, prohibited Grants Pass from enforcing its laws against homeless individuals in the city.  <em>Id</em>., at 182a–183a.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed in relevant part.  72 F.&nbsp;4th, at 874–896.  The majority agreed with the district court that all unsheltered individuals in Grants Pass qualify as “involuntarily homeless” because the city’s homeless population exceeds “available” shelter beds.  <em>Id.</em>, at 894.  And the majority further agreed that, under <em>Martin</em>,<em> </em>the homeless there cannot be punished for camping with “rudimentary forms of protection from the elements.”  72 F.&nbsp;4th, at 896.  In dissent, Judge Collins questioned <em>Martin</em>’s consistency with the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a> and<em> </em>lamented its “dire practical consequences” for the city and others like it.  72 F.&nbsp;4th, at 914 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The city sought rehearing en banc, which the court denied over the objection of 17 judges who joined five separate opinions.  <em>Id</em>., at 869, 924–945.  Judge O’Scannlain, joined by 14 judges, criticized <em>Martin</em>’s “jurisprudential experiment” as “egregiously flawed and deeply damaging—at war with the constitutional text, history, and tradition.”  72 F.&nbsp;4th, at 925, 926, n.&nbsp;2.  Judge Bress, joined by 11 judges, contended that <em>Martin </em>has “add[ed] enormous and unjustified complication to an already extremely complicated set of circumstances.”  72 F.&nbsp;4th, at 945.  And Judge Smith, &nbsp;joined by several others, described in painstaking detail the ways in which, in his view, <em>Martin </em>had thwarted good-faith attempts by cities across the West, from Phoenix to Sacramento, to address homelessness.  72 F.&nbsp;4th, at 934, 940–943.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Grants Pass filed a petition for certiorari.  A large number of States, cities, and counties from across the Ninth Circuit and the country joined Grants Pass in urging the Court to grant review to assess the <em>Martin</em> experiment.  See Part I–B, <em>supra</em>.  We agreed to do so.  601 U.&nbsp;S. ___ (2024).<a aria-label=\"reference 3 of Gorsuch Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-3\" id=\"OPINION_4-3ref\"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">&nbsp;II</h3>\n<h4 class=\"jy-center\">A</h4>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The Constitution and its Amendments impose a number of limits on what governments in this country may declare to be criminal behavior and how they may go about enforcing their criminal laws.  Familiarly, the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> prohibits governments from using their criminal laws to abridge the rights to speak, worship, assemble, petition, and exercise the freedom of the press.  The Equal Protection Clause of the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution Amendment xiv\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv\">Fourteenth Amendment</a> prevents governments from adopting laws that invidiously discriminate between persons.  The Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and <a aria-label=\"US Constitution Amendment xiv\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv\">Fourteenth Amendment</a>s ensure that officials may not displace certain rules associated with criminal liability that are “so old and venerable,” “&nbsp;‘so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people[,] as to be ranked as fundamental.’&nbsp;”  <em>Kahler</em> v. <em>Kansas</em>, <a aria-label=\"589 U. S. 271\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/589/271\">589 U.&nbsp;S. 271</a>, 279 (2020) (quoting <em>Leland</em> v. <em>Oregon</em>, <a aria-label=\"343 U. S. 790\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/343/790\">343 U.&nbsp;S. 790</a>, 798 (1952)).  The Fifth and <a aria-label=\"US Constitution sixth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment\">Sixth Amendment</a>s require prosecutors and courts to observe various procedures before denying any person of his liberty, promising for example that every person enjoys the right to confront his accusers and have serious criminal charges resolved by a jury of his peers.  One could go on.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> But if many other constitutional provisions address what a government may criminalize and how it may go about securing a conviction, the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a>’s prohibition against “cruel and unusual punishments” focuses on what happens next.  That Clause “has always been considered, and properly so, to be directed at the method or kind of punishment” a government may “impos[e] for the violation of criminal statutes.”  <em>Powell</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a aria-label=\"392 U. S. 514\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/392/514\">392 U.&nbsp;S. 514</a>, 531–532 (1968) (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> We have previously discussed the Clause’s origins and meaning.  In the 18th century, English law still “formally tolerated” certain barbaric punishments like “disemboweling, quartering, public dissection, and burning alive,” even &nbsp;though those practices had by then “fallen into disuse.”  <em>Bucklew</em> v. <em>Precythe</em>, <a aria-label=\"587 U. S. 119\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/587/119\">587 U.&nbsp;S. 119</a>, 130 (2019) (citing 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 370 (1769) (Blackstone)).  The Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause was adopted to ensure that the new Nation would never resort to any of those punishments or others like them.  Punishments like those were “cruel” because they were calculated to “&nbsp;‘superad[d]’&nbsp;” “&nbsp;‘terror, pain, or disgrace.’&nbsp;”  587 U.&nbsp;S., at 130  (quoting 4 Blackstone 370).  And they were “unusual” because, by the time of the Amendment’s adoption, they had “long fallen out of use.”  587 U.&nbsp;S., at 130.  Perhaps some of those who framed our Constitution thought, as Justice Story did, that a guarantee against those kinds of “atrocious” punishments would prove “unnecessary” because no “free government” would ever employ anything like them.  3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States §1896, p.&nbsp;750 (1833).  But in adopting the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a>, the framers took no chances.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> All that would seem to make the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a> a poor foundation on which to rest the kind of decree the plaintiffs seek in this case and the Ninth Circuit has endorsed since <em>Martin</em>.  The Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause focuses on the question what “method or kind of punishment” a government may impose after a criminal conviction, not on the question whether a government may criminalize particular behavior in the first place or how it may go about securing a conviction for that offense.  <em>Powell</em>, 392 U.&nbsp;S., at 531–532.  To the extent the Constitution speaks to those other matters, it does so, as we have seen, in other provisions.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Nor, focusing on the criminal punishments Grant Pass imposes, can we say they qualify as cruel and unusual.  Recall that, under the city’s ordinances, an initial offense may trigger a civil fine.  Repeat offenses may trigger an order temporarily barring an individual from camping in a public &nbsp;park.  Only those who later violate an order like that may face a criminal punishment of up to 30 days in jail and a larger fine.  See Part I–C, <em>supra</em>.  None of the city’s sanctions qualifies as cruel because none is designed to “superad[d]” “terror, pain, or disgrace.”  <em>Bucklew</em>, 587 U.&nbsp;S., at 130 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Nor are the city’s sanctions unusual, because similar punishments have been and remain among “the usual mode[s]” for punishing offenses throughout the country.  <em>Pervear</em> v. <em>Commonwealth</em>, 5 Wall. 475, 480 (1867); see 4 Blackstone 371–372; <em>Timbs</em> v. <em>Indiana</em>, <a aria-label=\"586 U. S. 146\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/586/146\">586 U.&nbsp;S. 146</a>, 165 (2019) (Thomas J., concurring in judgment) (describing fines as “&nbsp;‘the drudge-horse of criminal justice, probably the most common form of punishment’&nbsp;” (some internal quotation marks omitted)).  In fact, large numbers of cities and States across the country have long employed, and today employ, similar punishments for similar offenses.  See Part I–A, <em>supra</em>; Brief for Professor John F. Stinneford as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>7–13 (collecting historical and contemporary examples).  Notably, neither the plaintiffs nor the dissent meaningfully contests any of this.  See Brief for Respondents 40.<a aria-label=\"reference 4 of Gorsuch Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-4\" id=\"OPINION_4-4ref\"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Instead, the plaintiffs and the dissent pursue an entirely different theory.  They do not question that, by its terms, the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause speaks to the question what punishments may follow a criminal conviction, not to antecedent questions like what a State may criminalize or how it may go about securing a conviction.  Yet, echoing the Ninth Circuit in <em>Martin</em>,<em> </em>they insist one notable exception exists.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; In <em>Robinson</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a aria-label=\"370 U.S. 660\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/370/660\">370 U.&nbsp;S. 660 (1962)</a>, the plaintiffs and the dissent observe, this Court addressed a challenge to a criminal conviction under a California statute providing that “&nbsp;‘[n]o person shall .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. be addicted to the use of narcotics.’&nbsp;”  <em>Ibid</em>., n.&nbsp;1.  In response to that challenge, the Court invoked the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause to hold that California could not enforce its law making “the ‘status’ of narcotic addiction a criminal offense.”  <em>Id</em>., at 666.  The Court recognized that “imprisonment for ninety days is not, in the abstract, a punishment which is either cruel or unusual.”  <em>Id</em>., at 667.  But, the Court reasoned, when punishing “&nbsp;‘status,’&nbsp;” “[e]ven one day in prison would be .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. cruel and unusual.”  <em>Id</em>., at 666–667.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In doing so, the Court stressed the limits of its decision.  It would have ruled differently, the Court said, if California had sought to convict the defendant for, say, the knowing or intentional “use of narcotics, for their purchase, sale, or possession, or for antisocial or disorderly behavior resulting from their administration.”  <em>Id</em>., at 666.  In fact, the Court took pains to emphasize that it did not mean to cast doubt on the States’ “broad power” to prohibit behavior like that, even by those, like the defendant, who suffered from addiction.  <em>Id.</em>, at 664, 667–668.  The only problem, as the Court saw it, was that California’s law did not operate that way.  Instead, it made the mere status of being an addict a crime.  <em>Id</em>., at 666–667.  And it was that feature of the law, the Court held, that went too far.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Reaching that conclusion under the banner of the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a> may have come as a surprise to the litigants.  Mr. Robinson challenged his conviction principally on the ground that it offended the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution Amendment xiv\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv\">Fourteenth Amendment</a>’s guarantee of due process of law.  As he saw it, California’s law violated due process because it purported to make unlawful a “status” rather than the commission of any “volitional act.”  See Brief for Appellant in <em>Robinson</em> v. <em>California</em>, O.&nbsp;T. 1961, No. 61–554, p.&nbsp;13 (Robinson Brief&nbsp;).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; That framing may have made some sense.  Our due process jurisprudence has long taken guidance from the “settled usage[s] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in England and in this country.”  <em>Hurtado</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a aria-label=\"110 U. S. 516\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/110/516\">110 U.&nbsp;S. 516</a>, 528 (1884); see also <em>Kahler</em>, 589 U.&nbsp;S., at 279.  And, historically, crimes in England and this country have usually required proof of some act (or <em>actus reus</em>) undertaken with some measure of volition (<em>mens rea</em>).  At common law, “a complete crime” generally required “both a will and an act.”  4 Blackstone 21.  This view “took deep and early root in American soil” where, to this day, a crime ordinarily arises “only from concurrence of an evil-meaning mind with an evil-doing hand.”  <em>Morissette</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"342 U. S. 246\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/342/246\">342 U.&nbsp;S. 246</a>, 251–252 (1952).  Measured against these standards, California’s law was an anomaly, as it required proof of neither of those things.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Mr. Robinson’s resort to the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a> was comparatively brief.  He referenced it only in passing, and only for the proposition that forcing a drug addict like himself to go “&nbsp;‘cold turkey’&nbsp;” in a jail cell after conviction entailed such “intense mental and physical torment” that it was akin to “the burning of witches at the stake.”  Robinson Brief 30.  The State responded to that argument with barely a paragraph of analysis, Brief for Appellee in <em>Robinson</em> v. <em>California</em>, O.&nbsp;T. 1961, No. 61–554, pp.&nbsp;22–23, and it received virtually no attention at oral argument.  By almost every indication, then, <em>Robinson</em> was set to be a case about the scope of the Due Process Clause, or perhaps an <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a> case about whether forcing an addict to withdraw from drugs after conviction qualified as cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Of course, the case turned out differently.  Bypassing Mr. Robinson’s primary Due Process Clause argument, the Court charted its own course, reading the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause to impose a limit not just on what punishments may follow a criminal conviction but what a &nbsp;State may criminalize to begin with.  It was a view unprecedented in the history of the Court before 1962.  In dissent, Justice White lamented that the majority had embraced an “application of ‘cruel and unusual punishment’ so novel that” it could not possibly be “ascribe[d] to the Framers of the Constitution.”  370 U.&nbsp;S., at 689.  Nor, in the 62 years since <em>Robinson</em>, has this Court once invoked it as authority to decline the enforcement of any criminal law, leaving the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a> instead to perform its traditional function of addressing the punishments that follow a criminal conviction.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Still, no one has asked us to reconsider <em>Robinson</em>.  Nor do we see any need to do so today.  Whatever its persuasive force as an interpretation of the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a>, it cannot sustain the Ninth Circuit’s course since <em>Martin</em>.  In <em>Robinson</em>, the Court<em> </em>expressly recognized the “broad power” States enjoy over the substance of their criminal laws, stressing that they may criminalize knowing or intentional drug use even by those suffering from addiction.  370 U.&nbsp;S., at 664, 666.  The Court held only that a State may not criminalize the “&nbsp;‘status’&nbsp;” of being an addict.  <em>Id</em>., at 666.  In criminalizing a mere status, <em>Robinson </em>stressed, California had taken a historically anomalous approach toward criminal liability.  One, in fact, this Court has not encountered since <em>Robinson</em> itself.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Public camping ordinances like those before us are nothing like the law at issue in <em>Robinson</em>.  Rather than criminalize mere status, Grants Pass forbids actions like “occupy[ing] a campsite” on public property “for the purpose of maintaining a temporary place to live.”  Grants Pass Municipal Code §§5.61.030, 5.61.010; App. to Pet. for Cert. 221a–222a.  Under the city’s laws, it makes no difference whether the charged defendant is homeless, a backpacker on vacation passing through town, or a student who abandons his dorm room to camp out in protest on the lawn of a municipal building.  See Part I–C, <em>supra</em>; <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Grants Pass</em>, No. 1:18–cv–01823 (D Ore.), ECF Doc. 63–4, pp. 2, 16; Tr. of Oral Arg. 159.  In that respect, the city’s laws parallel those found in countless jurisdictions across the country.  See Part I–A, <em>supra</em>.  And because laws like these do not criminalize mere status, <em>Robinson</em> is not implicated.<a aria-label=\"reference 5 of Gorsuch Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-5\" id=\"OPINION_4-5ref\"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">C</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> If <em>Robinson</em> does not control this case, the plaintiffs and the dissent argue, we should extend it so that it does.  Perhaps a person does not violate ordinances like Grants Pass’s simply by being homeless but only by engaging in certain acts (<em>actus rei</em>) with certain mental states (<em>mentes reae</em>).  Still, the plaintiffs and the dissent insist, laws like these seek to regulate actions that are in some sense “involuntary,” for some homeless persons cannot help but do what the law forbids.  See Brief for Respondents 24–25, 29, 32; <em>post</em>, at 16–17 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Sotomayor, J</span>.).  And, the plaintiffs and the dissent continue, we should extend <em>Robinson</em> to prohibit the enforcement of laws that operate this way—laws that don’t proscribe status as such but that proscribe acts, even acts undertaken with some required mental state, the defendant cannot help but undertake.  <em>Post</em>, at 16–17.  To rule otherwise, the argument goes, would “&nbsp;‘effectively’&nbsp;” allow cities to punish a person because of his status.  <em>Post</em>, at 25<span class=\"smallcaps\">.  </span>The Ninth Circuit pursued just this line of thinking below and in <em>Martin</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The problem is, this Court has already rejected that view.  &nbsp;In <em>Powell</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a aria-label=\"392 U.S. 514\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/392/514\">392 U.&nbsp;S. 514 (1968)</a>, the Court confronted a defendant who had been convicted under a Texas statute making it a crime to “&nbsp;‘get drunk or be found in a state of intoxication in any public place.’&nbsp;”  <em>Id</em>., at 517 (plurality opinion).  Like the plaintiffs here, Mr. Powell argued that his drunkenness was an “&nbsp;‘involuntary’&nbsp;” byproduct of his status as an alcoholic. <em> Id</em>., at 533.  Yes, the statute required proof of an act (becoming drunk or intoxicated and then proceeding into public), and perhaps some associated mental state (for presumably the defendant knew he was drinking and maybe even knew he made his way to a public place).  Still, Mr. Powell contended, Texas’s law effectively criminalized his status as an alcoholic because he could not help but doing as he did.  <em>Ibid. </em> Justice Fortas embraced that view, but only in dissent:  He would have extended <em>Robinson </em>to cover conduct that flows from any “condition [the defendant] is powerless to change.”  392 U.&nbsp;S., at 567 (Fortas, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Court did not agree.  Writing for a plurality, Justice Marshall observed that <em>Robinson </em>had authorized “a very small” intrusion by courts “into the substantive criminal law” “under the aegis of the Cruel and Unusual Punishment[s] Clause.”<em> </em>392 U.&nbsp;S., at 533.  That small intrusion, Justice Marshall said, prevents States only from enforcing laws that criminalize “a mere status.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 532.  It does nothing to curtail a State’s authority to secure a conviction when “the accused has committed some act .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. society has an interest in preventing.”  <em>Id</em>., at 533.  That remains true, Justice Marshall continued, regardless whether the defendant’s act “in some sense” might be described as<em> </em>“&nbsp;‘<em>involuntary</em>’ <em>or </em>‘<em>occasioned by</em>’&nbsp;” a particular status.  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  In this, Justice Marshall echoed <em>Robinson</em> itself, where the Court emphasized that California remained free to criminalize intentional or knowing drug use even by addicts whose conduct, too, in some sense could be considered involuntary.  See <em>Robinson</em>, 370 U.&nbsp;S., at 664, 666. <em> </em>Based &nbsp;on all this, Justice Marshall concluded, because the defendant before the Court had not been convicted “for being” an “alcoholic, but for [engaging in the act of] being in public while drunk on a particular occasion,” <em>Robinson</em> did not apply.  <em>Powell</em>, 392 U.&nbsp;S., at 532.<a aria-label=\"reference 6 of Gorsuch Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-6\" id=\"OPINION_4-6ref\"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This case is no different from <em>Powell.</em>  Just as there, the plaintiffs here seek to expand <em>Robinson</em>’s “small” intrusion “into the substantive criminal law.”  Just as there, the plaintiffs here seek to extend its rule beyond laws addressing “mere status” to laws addressing actions that, even if undertaken with the requisite <em>mens rea</em>, might “in some sense” qualify as “&nbsp;‘involuntary.’&nbsp;”  And just as <em>Powell</em> could find nothing in the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a> permitting that course, neither can we.  As we have seen, <em>Robinson </em>already sits uneasily with the Amendment’s terms, original meaning, and our precedents.  Its holding is restricted to laws that criminalize “mere status.”  Nothing in the decision<em> </em>called into question the “broad power” of States to regulate acts undertaken with some <em>mens rea</em>.  And, just as in <em>Powell</em>, we discern nothing in the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a> that might provide us with lawful authority to extend <em>Robinson</em> beyond its narrow holding.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; To be sure, and once more, a variety of other legal doctrines and constitutional provisions work to protect those in our criminal justice system from a conviction.  Like some other jurisdictions, Oregon recognizes a “necessity&nbsp;” defense to certain criminal charges.  It may be that defense extends to charges for illegal camping when it comes to those with nowhere else to go.  See <em>State</em> v. <em>Barrett</em>, 302 Ore. App. 23, 28, 460 P.&nbsp;3d 93, 96 (2020) (citing Ore. Rev. Stat. §161.200).  Insanity, diminished-capacity, and duress defenses also may be available in many jurisdictions.  See <em>Powell</em>, 392 U.&nbsp;S., at 536.  States and cities are free as well to add additional substantive protections.  Since this litigation began, for example, Oregon itself has adopted a law specifically addressing how far its municipalities may go in regulating public camping.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Ore. Rev. Stat. §195.530(2) (2023).  For that matter, nothing in today’s decision prevents States, cities, and counties from going a step further and declining to criminalize public camping altogether.  For its part, the Constitution provides many additional limits on state prosecutorial power, promising fair notice of the laws and equal treatment under them, forbidding selective prosecutions, and much more besides.  See Part II–A, <em>supra</em>; and n.&nbsp;5, <em>supra</em>.  All this represents only a small sample of the legion protections our society affords a presumptively free individual from a criminal conviction.  But aside from <em>Robinson</em>, a case directed to a highly unusual law that condemned status alone, this Court has never invoked the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a>’s Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause to perform that function.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">D</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Not only did <em>Powell</em> decline to extend <em>Robinson</em> to “involuntary” acts, it stressed the dangers that would likely attend any attempt to do so.  Were the Court to pursue that path in the name of the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a>, Justice Marshall warned, “it is difficult to see any limiting principle &nbsp;that would serve to prevent this Court from becoming .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the ultimate arbiter of the standards of criminal responsibility, in diverse areas of the criminal law, throughout the country.”  <em>Powell</em>, 392 U.&nbsp;S., at 533.  After all, nothing in the Amendment’s text or history exists to “confine” or guide our review.  <em>Id.</em>, at 534.  Unaided by those sources, we would be left “to write into the Constitution” our own “formulas,” many of which would likely prove unworkable in practice.  <em>Id</em>., at 537.  Along the way, we would interfere with “essential considerations of federalism” that reserve to the States primary responsibility for drafting their own criminal laws.  <em>Id.</em>, at 535.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In particular, Justice Marshall observed, extending <em>Robinson</em> to cover involuntary acts would effectively “impe[l]” this Court “into defining” something akin to a new “insanity test in constitutional terms.”  392 U.&nbsp;S., at 536.  It would because an individual like the defendant in <em>Powell</em> does not dispute that he has committed an otherwise criminal act with the requisite <em>mens rea</em>, yet he seeks to be excused from “moral accountability” because of his “&nbsp;‘condition.’&nbsp;”  <em>Id.</em>, at 535–536.  And “[n]othing,” Justice Marshall said, “could be less fruitful than for this Court” to try to resolve for the Nation profound questions like that under a provision of the Constitution that does not speak to them.  <em>Id</em>., at 536.  Instead, Justice Marshall reasoned, such matters are generally left to be resolved through “productive” democratic “dialogue” and “experimentation,” not by “freez[ing]” any particular, judicially preferred approach “into a rigid constitutional mold.”  <em>Id</em>., at 537.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> We recently reemphasized that last point in <em>Kahler</em> v. <em>Kansas</em> in the context of a Due Process Clause challenge.  Drawing on Justice Marshall’s opinion in <em>Powell</em>, we acknowledged that “a state rule about criminal liability” may violate due process if it departs from a rule “so rooted in the traditions” of this Nation that it might be said to &nbsp;“ran[k] as fundamental.”  589 U.&nbsp;S., at 279 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But, we stressed, questions about whether an individual who has committed a proscribed act with the requisite mental state should be “reliev[ed of] responsibility,” <em>id.</em>, at 283, due to a lack of “moral culpability,” <em>id.</em>, at 286, are generally best resolved by the people and their elected representatives.  Those are questions, we said, “of recurrent controversy” to which history supplies few “entrenched” answers, and on which the Constitution generally commands “no one view.”  <em>Id</em>., at 296.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Ninth Circuit’s <em>Martin</em> experiment defied these lessons.  Under <em>Martin</em>, judges take from elected representatives the questions whether and when someone who has committed a proscribed act with a requisite mental state should be “relieved of responsibility” for lack of “moral culpability.”  598 U.&nbsp;S., at 283, 286.  And <em>Martin </em>exemplifies much of what can go wrong when courts try to resolve matters like those unmoored from any secure guidance in the Constitution.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Start with this problem.  Under <em>Martin</em>, cities must allow public camping by those who are “involuntarily” homeless.  72 F.&nbsp;4th, at 877 (citing <em>Martin</em>, <a aria-label=\"920 F.3d 617\" href=\"/rio/citation/920_F.3d_617\">920 F.&nbsp;3d, at 617</a>, n.&nbsp;8).  But how are city officials and law enforcement officers to know what it means to be “involuntarily” homeless, or whether any particular person meets that standard?  Posing the questions may be easy; answering them is not.  Is it enough that a homeless person has turned down an offer of shelter?  Or does it matter why?  Cities routinely confront individuals who decline offers of shelter for any number of reasons, ranging from safety concerns to individual preferences.  See Part I–A, <em>supra</em>.  How are cities and their law enforcement officers on the ground to know which of these reasons are sufficiently weighty to qualify a person as “involuntarily” homeless?</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> If there are answers to those questions, they cannot be found in the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause.  Nor &nbsp;do federal judges enjoy any special competence to provide them.  Cities across the West report that the Ninth Circuit’s ill-defined involuntariness test has proven “unworkable.”  Oregon Cities Brief 3; see Phoenix Brief 11.  The test, they say, has left them “with little or no direction as to the scope of their authority in th[eir] day-to-day policing contacts,” California Sheriffs Brief 6, and under “threat of federal litigation .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at all times and in all circumstances,” Oregon Cities Brief 6–7.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> To be sure, <em>Martin</em> attempted to head off these complexities through some back-of-the-envelope arithmetic.  The Ninth Circuit said a city needs to consider individuals “involuntarily” homeless (and thus entitled to camp on public property) only when the overall homeless population exceeds the total number of “adequate” and “practically available” shelter beds.  See <a aria-label=\"920 F.3d 617\" href=\"/rio/citation/920_F.3d_617\">920 F.&nbsp;3d, at 617</a>–618, and n.&nbsp;8.  But as sometimes happens with abstract rules created by those far from the front lines, that test has proven all but impossible to administer in practice.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> City officials report that it can be “monumentally difficult” to keep an accurate accounting of those experiencing homelessness on any given day.  Los Angeles Cert. Brief 14.  Often, a city’s homeless population “fluctuate[s] dramatically,” in part because homelessness is an inherently dynamic status.  Brief for City of San Clemente as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 16 (San Clemente Brief&nbsp;).<em> </em>While cities sometimes make rough estimates based on a single point-in-time count, they say it would be “impossibly expensive and difficult” to undertake that effort with any regularity.  <em>Id</em>., at 17.  In Los Angeles, for example, it takes three days to count the homeless population block-by-block—even with the participation of thousands of volunteers.  <em>Martin</em>, <a aria-label=\"920 F.3d 595\" href=\"/rio/citation/920_F.3d_595\">920 F.&nbsp;3d, at 595</a> (Smith, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Beyond these complexities, more await.  Suppose even large cities could keep a running tally of their homeless citizens forevermore.  And suppose further that they could &nbsp;keep a live inventory of available shelter beds.  Even so, cities face questions over which shelter beds count as “adequate” and “available” under <em>Martin</em>.  <em>Id.</em>, at 617, and n.&nbsp;8.  Rather than resolve the challenges associated with defining who qualifies as “involuntarily” homeless, these standards more nearly return us to them.  Is a bed “available” to a smoker if the shelter requires residents to abstain from nicotine, as the shelter in Grants Pass does?  72 F.&nbsp;4th, at 896; App. 39, Third Amended Complaint ¶13.  Is a bed “available” to an atheist if the shelter includes “religious” messaging?  72 F.&nbsp;4th, at 877.  And how is a city to know whether the accommodations it provides will prove “adequate” in later litigation?  <a aria-label=\"920 F.3d 617\" href=\"/rio/citation/920_F.3d_617\">920 F.&nbsp;3d, at 617</a>, n.&nbsp;8.  Once more, a large number of cities in the Ninth Circuit tell us they have no way to be sure.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Phoenix Brief 28; San Clemente Brief 8–12; Brief for City of Los Angeles as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 22–23 (“What may be available, appropriate, or actually beneficial to one [homeless] person, might not be so to another”).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Consider an example.  The city of Chico, California, thought it was complying with <em>Martin</em> when it constructed an outdoor shelter facility at its municipal airport to accommodate its homeless population.  <em>Warren</em> v. <em>Chico</em>, 2021 WL 2894648, *3 (ED Cal., July 8, 2021).  That shelter, we are told, included “protective fencing, large water totes, handwashing stations, portable toilets, [and] a large canopy for shade.”  Brief for City of Chico as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> on Pet. for Cert. 16.  Still, a district court enjoined the city from enforcing its public-camping ordinance.  Why?  Because, in that court’s view, “appropriate” shelter requires “&nbsp;‘indoo[r],’&nbsp;” not outdoor, spaces.  <em>Warren</em>, 2021 WL 2894648, *3 (quoting <em>Martin</em>, <a aria-label=\"920 F.3d 617\" href=\"/rio/citation/920_F.3d_617\">920 F.&nbsp;3d, at 617</a>).  One federal court in Los Angeles ruled, during the COVID pandemic, that “adequate” shelter must also include nursing staff, testing for communicable diseases, and on-site security, among other things.  See <em>LA Alliance for Hum. Rights</em> v. <em>Los Angeles</em>, 2020 WL 2512811, &nbsp;*4 (CD Cal., May 15, 2020).  By imbuing the availability of shelter with constitutional significance in this way,  many cities tell us, <em>Martin </em>and its progeny have “paralyzed” communities and prevented them from implementing even policies designed to help the homeless while remaining sensitive to the limits of their resources and the needs of other citizens.  Cities Cert. Brief 4 (boldface and capitalization deleted).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> There are more problems still.  The Ninth Circuit held that “involuntarily” homeless individuals cannot be punished for camping with materials “necessary to protect themselves from the elements.”  72 F.&nbsp;4th, at 896.  It suggested, too, that cities cannot proscribe “life-sustaining act[s]” that flow necessarily from homelessness.  72 F.&nbsp;4th, at 921 (joint statement of Silver and Gould, JJ., regarding denial of rehearing).  But how far does that go?  The plaintiffs before us suggest a blanket is all that is required in Grants Pass.  Brief for Respondents 14.  But might a colder climate trigger a right to permanent tent encampments and fires for warmth?  Because the contours of this judicial right are so “uncertai[n],” cities across the West have been left to guess whether <em>Martin </em>forbids their officers from removing everything from tents to “portable heaters” on city sidewalks.  Brief for City of Phoenix et&nbsp;al. on Pet. for Cert. 19, 29 (Phoenix Cert. Brief&nbsp;).  There is uncertainty, as well, over whether <em>Martin </em>requires cities to tolerate other acts no less “attendant [to] survival” than sleeping, such as starting fires to cook food and “public urination [and] defecation.”  Phoenix Cert. Brief 29–30; see also <em>Mahoney</em> v. <em>Sacramento</em>, 2020 WL 616302, *3 (ED Cal., Feb. 10, 2020) (indicating that “the [c]ity may not prosecute or otherwise penalize the [homeless] for eliminating in public if there is no alternative to doing so”).  By extending <em>Robinson</em> beyond the narrow class of status crimes, the Ninth Circuit has created a right that has proven “impossible” for judges to delineate except “by fiat.”  <em>Powell</em>, 392 U.&nbsp;S., at 534.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; Doubtless, the Ninth Circuit’s intervention in <em>Martin</em> was well-intended.  But since the trial court entered its injunction against Grants Pass, the city shelter reports that utilization of its resources has fallen by roughly 40 percent.  See Brief for Grants Pass Gospel Rescue Mission as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 4–5.  Many other cities offer similar accounts about their experiences after <em>Martin</em>, telling us the decision has made it more difficult, not less, to help the homeless accept shelter off city streets.  See Part I–B, <em>supra</em> (recounting examples).  Even when “policymakers would prefer to invest in more permanent” programs and policies designed to benefit homeless and other citizens, <em>Martin</em> has forced these “overwhelmed jurisdictions to concentrate public resources on temporary shelter beds.”  Cities Brief 25; see Oregon Cities Brief 17–20; States Brief 16–17.  As a result, cities report, <em>Martin</em> has undermined their efforts to balance conflicting public needs and mired them in litigation at a time when the homelessness crisis calls for action.  See States Brief 16–17.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> All told, the <em>Martin</em> experiment is perhaps just what Justice Marshall anticipated ones like it would be.  The <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a> provides no guidance to “confine” judges in deciding what conduct a State or city may or may not proscribe.  <em>Powell</em>, 392 U.&nbsp;S., at 534.  Instead of encouraging “productive dialogue” and “experimentation” through our democratic institutions, courts have frozen in place their own “formulas” by “fiat.”  <em>Id</em>., at 534, 537.  Issued by federal courts removed from realities on the ground, those rules have produced confusion.  And they have interfered with “essential considerations of federalism,” taking from the people and their elected leaders difficult questions traditionally “thought to be the[ir] province.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 535–536.<a aria-label=\"reference 7 of Gorsuch Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-7\" id=\"OPINION_4-7ref\"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">&nbsp;E</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Rather than address what we have actually said, the dissent accuses us of extending to local governments an “unfettered freedom to punish,” <em>post</em>, at 25, and stripping away any protections “the Constitution” has against “criminalizing sleeping,” <em>post</em>, at 5.  “Either stay awake,” the dissent warns, “or be arrested.”  <em>Post</em>, at 2.  That is gravely mistaken.  We hold nothing of the sort.  As we have stressed, cities and States are not bound to adopt public-camping laws.  They may also choose to narrow such laws (as Oregon itself has recently).  Beyond all that, many substantive legal protections and provisions of the Constitution may have important roles to play when States and cities seek to enforce their laws against the homeless.  See Parts II–A, II–C, <em>supra</em>.  The only question we face is whether one specific provision of the Constitution—the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a>—prohibits the enforcement of public-camping laws.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Nor does the dissent meaningfully engage with the reasons we have offered for our conclusion on that question.  It claims that we “gratuitously” treat <em>Robinson</em> “as an outlier.”  <em>Post</em>, at 12, and n.&nbsp;2.  But the dissent does not dispute that &nbsp;the law <em>Robinson</em> faced was an anomaly, punishing mere status.  The dissent does not dispute that <em>Robinson</em>’s decision to address that law under the rubric of the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a> is itself hard to square with the Amendment’s text and this Court’s other precedents interpreting it.  And the dissent all but ignores <em>Robinson</em>’s own insistence that a different result would have obtained in that case if the law there had proscribed an act rather than status alone.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Tellingly, too, the dissent barely mentions Justice Marshall’s opinion in <em>Powell</em>.  There, reasoning exactly as we do today, Justice Marshall refused to extend <em>Robinson</em> to actions undertaken, “in some sense, ‘involuntar[ily].’&nbsp;”  392 U.&nbsp;S., at 533.  Rather than confront any of this, the dissent brusquely calls <em>Powell</em> a “strawman” and seeks to distinguish it on the inscrutable ground that Grants Pass penalizes “status[-defining]” (rather than “involuntary”) conduct.  <em>Post</em>,<em> </em>at 23.  But whatever that might mean, it is no answer to the reasoning Justice Marshall offered, to its obvious relevance here, or to the fact this Court has since endorsed Justice Marshall’s reasoning as correct in cases like <em>Kahler</em> and <em>Jones</em>, cases that go undiscussed in the dissent.  See n.&nbsp;6, <em>supra.</em>  The only extraordinary result we might reach in this case is one that would defy <em>Powell</em>, ignore the historical reach of the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a>, and transform <em>Robinson</em>’s narrow holding addressing a peculiar law punishing status alone into a new rule that would bar the enforcement of laws that are, as the dissent puts it, “&nbsp;‘pervasive’&nbsp;” throughout the country.  <em>Post</em>, at 15; Part I–A, <em>supra</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> To be sure, the dissent seeks to portray the new rule it advocates as a modest, “limited,” and “narrow” one addressing only those who wish to fulfill a “biological necessity” and “keep warm outside with a blanket” when they have no other “adequate” place “to go.”  <em>Post</em>, at 1, 5, 10, 21, 24.  But that reply blinks the difficult questions that necessarily follow and the Ninth Circuit has been forced to confront:  What does it mean to be “involuntarily” homeless with “no &nbsp;place to go”?  What kind of “adequate” shelter must a city provide to avoid being forced to allow people to camp in its parks and on its sidewalks?  And what are people entitled to do and use in public spaces to “keep warm” and fulfill other “biological necessities”?<a aria-label=\"reference 8 of Gorsuch Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-8\" id=\"OPINION_4-8ref\"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Those unavoidable questions have plunged courts and cities across the Ninth Circuit into waves of litigation.  And without anything in the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a> to guide them, any answers federal judges can offer (and have offered) come, as Justice Marshall foresaw, only by way of “fiat.”  <em>Powell</em>, 392 U.&nbsp;S., at 534.  The dissent cannot escape that hard truth.  Nor can it escape the fact that, far from narrowing <em>Martin</em>, it would expand its experiment from one circuit to the entire country—a development without any precedent in this Court’s history.  One that would authorize &nbsp;federal judges to freeze into place their own rules on matters long “thought to be the province” of state and local leaders, <em>id.</em>, at 536, and one that would deny communities the “wide latitude” and “flexibility” even the dissent acknowledges they need to address the homelessness crisis, <em>post</em>, at 2, 5.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">III</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Homelessness is complex.  Its causes are many.  So may be the public policy responses required to address it.  At bottom, the question this case presents is whether the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a> grants federal judges primary responsibility for assessing those causes and devising those responses.  It does not.  Almost 200 years ago, a visitor to this country remarked upon the “extreme skill with which the inhabitants of the United States succeed in proposing a common object to the exertions of a great many men, and in getting them voluntarily to pursue it.”  2 A. de Tocqueville, Democracy in America 129 (H. Reeve transl. 1961).  If the multitude of <em>amicus</em> briefs before us proves one thing, it is that the American people are still at it.  Through their voluntary associations and charities, their elected representatives and appointed officials, their police officers and mental health professionals, they display that same energy and skill today in their efforts to address the complexities of the homelessness challenge facing the most vulnerable among us.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Yes, people will disagree over which policy responses are best; they may experiment with one set of approaches only to find later another set works better; they may find certain responses more appropriate for some communities than others.  But in our democracy, that is their right.  Nor can a handful of federal judges begin to “match” the collective wisdom the American people possess in deciding “how best to handle” a pressing social question like homelessness.  <em>Robinson</em>, 370 U.&nbsp;S., at 689 (White, J., dissenting).  The &nbsp;Constitution’s <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a> serves many important functions, but it does not authorize federal judges to wrest those rights and responsibilities from the American people and in their place dictate this Nation’s homelessness policy.  The judgment below is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"></p>\n<p class=\"flushrgtpara jy-right\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<h3 class=\"fnheader\">Notes</h3>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-1\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Gorsuch Opinion at reference 1\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-1ref\">1</a> &nbsp;The dissent cites minutes from a community roundtable meeting to suggest that officials in Grants Pass harbored only punitive motives when adopting their camping ban.  <em>Post</em>, at 13–14 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Sotomayor, J.</span>).  But the dissent tells at best half the story about that meeting.  In his opening remarks, the Mayor stressed that the city’s goal was to “find a balance between providing the help [homeless] people need and not enabling .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. aggressive negative behavior” some community members had experienced.  App. 112.  And, by all accounts, the “purpose” of the meeting was to “develo[p&nbsp;] strategies to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. connect [homeless] people to services.”  <em>Ibid.</em>  The city manager and others explained that the city was dealing with problems of “harassment” and “defecation in public places” by those who seemingly “do not want to receive services.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 113, 118–120.  At the same time, they celebrated “the strong commitment” from “faith-based entities” and a “huge number of people” in the city, who have “come together for projects” to support the homeless, including by securing “funding for a sobering center.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 115, 123.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-2\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Gorsuch Opinion at reference 2\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-2ref\">2</a> &nbsp;Another named plaintiff, Debra Blake, passed away while this case was pending in the Ninth Circuit, and her claims are not before us.  72 F.&nbsp;4th 868, 880, n.&nbsp;12 (2023).

Perhaps the dissent means to suggest that some cities selectively “enforce” their public-camping laws only against homeless persons.  See <em>post</em>, at 17–19.  But if that’s the dissent’s theory, it is not one that arises under the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a>’s Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause.  Instead, if anything, it may implicate due process and our precedents regarding selective prosecution.  See,<em> e.g., United States</em> v. <em>Armstrong,</em> <a aria-label=\"517 U.S. 456\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/517/456\">517 U.&nbsp;S. 456 (1996)</a>.  No claim like that is before us in this case.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-6\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Gorsuch Opinion at reference 6\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-6ref\">6</a> &nbsp;Justice White, who cast the fifth vote upholding the conviction, concurred in the result.  Writing only for himself, Justice White expressed some sympathy for Justice Fortas’s theory, but ultimately deemed that “novel construction” of the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a> “unnecessary to pursue” because the defendant hadn’t proven that his alcoholism made him “unable to stay off the streets on the night in question.”  392 U.&nbsp;S., at 552, n.&nbsp;4, 553–554 (White, J., concurring in result).  In <em>Martin</em>, the Ninth Circuit suggested Justice White’s solo concurrence somehow rendered the <em>Powell </em>dissent controlling and the plurality a dissent.  See <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Boise</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/920_F.3d_584\">920 F.&nbsp;3d 584</a>, 616–617 (2019).  Before us, neither the plaintiffs nor the dissent defend that theory, and for good reason:  In the years since <em>Powell</em>, this Court has repeatedly relied on Justice Marshall’s opinion, as we do today.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Kahler </em>v.<em> Kansas</em>,<em> </em><a aria-label=\"589 U.

In fact, all the States, cities, and counties listed above (n.&nbsp;3, <em>supra</em>) asked us to review this case.  Among them all, the dissent purports to identify just two public officials and two cities that, according to the dissent, support its view.  <em>Post</em>, at 24–25.  But even among that select group, the dissent overlooks the fact that each expresses strong dissatisfaction with how <em>Martin</em> has been applied in practice.<em> </em>See San Francisco Brief 15, 26 (“[T]he Ninth Circuit and its lower courts have repeatedly misapplied and overextended the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a>” and “hamstrung San Francisco’s balanced approach to addressing the homelessness crisis”); Brief for City of Los Angeles as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 6 (“[T]he sweeping rationale in <em>Martin</em> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. calls into question whether cities can enforce public health and safety laws”); California Governor Brief 3 (“In the wake of <em>Martin</em>, lower courts have blocked efforts to clear encampments while micromanaging what qualifies as a suitable offer of shelter”).  And for all the reasons we have explored and so many other cities have suggested, we see no principled basis under the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a> for federal judges to administer anything like <em>Martin</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-8\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Gorsuch Opinion at reference 8\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-8ref\">8</a> &nbsp;The dissent brushes aside these questions, declaring that “available answers” exist in the decisions below.  <em>Post</em>, at 22.  But the dissent misses the point.  The problem, as Justice Marshall discussed, is not that it is impossible for someone to dictate answers to these questions.  The problem is that nothing in the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a> gives federal judges the authority or guidance they need to answer them in a principled way.  Take just two examples.  First, the dissent says, a city seeking to ban camping must provide “adequate” shelter for those with “no place to go.”  <em>Post</em>, at 21–22.  But it never says what qualifies as “adequate” shelter.  <em>Ibid.</em>  And, as we have seen, cities and courts across the Ninth Circuit have struggled mightily with that question, all with nothing in the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a> to guide their work.  Second, the dissent seems to think that, if a city lacks enough “adequate” shelter, it must permit “&nbsp;‘bedding’&nbsp;” in public spaces, but not campfires, tents, or “&nbsp;‘public urination or defecation.’&nbsp;”  <em>Post</em>, at 15, 21–22, 24.  But where does that rule come from, the federal register?  See <em>post</em>, at 22.  After <em>Martin</em>, again as we have seen, many courts have taken a very different view.  The dissent never explains why it disagrees with those courts.  Instead, it merely quotes the district court’s opinion in this case that announced a rule it seems the dissent happens to prefer.  By elevating <em>Martin</em> over our own precedents and the Constitution’s original public meaning, the dissent faces difficult choices that cannot be swept under the rug—ones that it can resolve not by anything found in the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a>, only by fiat.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"concurrence\">&nbsp;<hr><a aria-label=\"Top\" href=\"#writing-ZS\" id=\"writing-23-175_CONCUR_5\"><strong>TOP</strong></a>\n<h2>Concurrence</h2>\n<div class=\"bodytext\">\n<p class=\"scusnameplate jy-center\">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p class=\"rule jy-center\">_________________</p>\n<p class=\"casenumber jy-center\">No. 23–175</p>\n<p class=\"rule jy-center\">_________________</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-a jy-center\">CITY OF GRANTS PASS, OREGON, PETITIONER <em>v.</em> Gloria Johnson, <span class=\"smallcaps\">et&nbsp;al.</span>, <span class=\"smallcaps\">on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"sylct-b sc-1 jy-center\">on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</h4>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"opiniondates\">[June 28, 2024]</div>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"casct-a jy-both\"><span class=\"smallcaps\"> Justice Thomas</span>, concurring.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> I join the Court’s opinion in full because it correctly rejects the respondents’ claims under the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause.  As the Court observes, that Clause “focuses on the question what method or kind of punishment a government may impose after a criminal conviction.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 16 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The respondents, by contrast, ask whether Grants Pass “may criminalize particular behavior in the first place.”  <em>Ibid.  </em>I write separately to make two additional observations about the respondents’ claims.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> First, the precedent that the respondents primarily rely upon, <em>Robinson</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a aria-label=\"370 U.S. 660\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/370/660\">370 U.&nbsp;S. 660 (1962)</a>, was wrongly decided.  In <em>Robinson</em>, the Court held that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause prohibits the enforcement of laws criminalizing a person’s status.  <em>Id</em>., at 666.  That holding conflicts with the plain text and history of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause.  See <em>ante,</em> at 15–16.  That fact is unsurprising given that the <em>Robinson </em>Court made no attempt to analyze the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a>’s text or discern its original meaning.  Instead, <em>Robinson</em>’s holding rested almost entirely on the Court’s understanding of public opinion: The <em>Robinson </em>Court observed that “in &nbsp;the light of contemporary human knowledge, a law which made a criminal offense of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a disease [such as narcotics addiction] would doubtless be universally thought to be an infliction of cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and <a aria-label=\"US Constitution Amendment xiv\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv\">Fourteenth Amendment</a>s.”  370 U.&nbsp;S., at 666.  Modern public opinion is not an appropriate metric for interpreting the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause—or any provision of the Constitution for that matter.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Much of the Court’s other <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a> precedents make the same mistake.  Rather than interpret our written Constitution, the Court has at times “proclaim[ed] itself sole arbiter of our Nation’s moral standards,” <em>Roper</em> v. <em>Simmons</em>, <a aria-label=\"543 U. S. 551\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/543/551\">543 U.&nbsp;S. 551</a>, 608 (2005) (Scalia, J., dissenting), and has set out to enforce “evolving standards of decency,” <em>Trop</em> v. <em>Dulles</em>, <a aria-label=\"356 U. S. 86\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/356/86\">356 U.&nbsp;S. 86</a>, 101 (1958) (plurality opinion).  “In a system based upon constitutional and statutory text democratically adopted, the concept of ‘law’ ordinarily signifies that particular words have a fixed meaning.”  <em>Roper</em>, 543 U.&nbsp;S., at 629 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  I continue to believe that we should adhere to the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause’s fixed meaning in resolving any challenge brought under it.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> To be sure, we need not reconsider <em>Robinson</em> to resolve this case.  As the Court explains, the challenged ordinances regulate conduct, not status, and thus do not implicate <em>Robinson.</em> <em>Ante,</em> at 20–21.  Moreover, it is unclear what, if any, weight <em>Robinson </em>carries.  The Court has not once applied <em>Robinson</em>’s interpretation of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause.  And, today the Court rightly questions the decision’s “persuasive force.”  <em>Ante, </em>at 20.  Still, rather than let <em>Robinson</em>’s erroneous holding linger in the background of our <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a> jurisprudence, we should dispose of it once and for all.  In an appropriate case, the Court should certainly correct this error.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Second, the respondents have not established that their claims implicate the Cruel and Unusual Punishments &nbsp;Clause in the first place.  The challenged ordinances are enforced through the imposition of civil fines and civil park exclusion orders, as well as through criminal trespass charges.  But, “[a]t the time the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a> was ratified, the word ‘punishment’ referred to the penalty imposed for the commission of a crime.”  <em>Helling</em> v. <em>McKinney</em>, <a aria-label=\"509 U. S. 25\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/509/25\">509 U.&nbsp;S. 25</a>, 38 (1993) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas</span>, J., dissenting); see <em>ante,</em> at 15–16.  The respondents have yet to explain how the civil fines and park exclusion orders constitute a “penalty imposed for the commission of a crime.”  <em>Helling</em>, 509 U.&nbsp;S., at 38.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> For its part, the Court of Appeals concluded that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause governs these civil penalties because they can “later .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. become criminal offenses.”  72 F.&nbsp;4th 868, 890 (CA9 2023).  But, that theory rests on layer upon layer of speculation.  It requires reasoning that because violating one of the ordinances “<em>could</em> result in civil citations and fines, [and] repeat violators <em>could</em> be excluded from specified City property, and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. violating an exclusion order <em>could</em> subject a violator to criminal trespass prosecution,” civil fines and park exclusion orders therefore must be governed by the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause.  <em>Id</em>., at 926 (O’Scannlain, J., statement respecting denial of rehearing en banc) (emphasis added).  And, if this case is any indication, the possibility that a civil fine turns into a criminal trespass charge is a remote one.  The respondents assert that they have been involuntarily homeless in Grants Pass for years, yet they have never received a park exclusion order, much less a criminal trespass charge.  See <em>ante,</em> at 11.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Because the respondents’ claims fail either way, the Court does not address the merits of the Court of Appeals’ theory.  See <em>ante, </em>at 16–17, and n. 4.  Suffice it to say, we have never endorsed such a broad view of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause.  Both this Court and lower courts should be wary of expanding the Clause beyond its &nbsp;text and original meaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"dissent\">&nbsp;<hr><a aria-label=\"Top\" href=\"#writing-ZS\" id=\"writing-23-175_DISSENT_6\"><strong>TOP</strong></a>\n<h2>Dissent</h2>\n<div class=\"bodytext\">\n<p class=\"scusnameplate jy-center\">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p class=\"rule jy-center\">_________________</p>\n<p class=\"casenumber jy-center\">No. 23–175</p>\n<p class=\"rule jy-center\">_________________</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-a jy-center\">CITY OF GRANTS PASS, OREGON, PETITIONER <em>v.</em> Gloria Johnson, <span class=\"smallcaps\">et&nbsp;al.</span>, <span class=\"smallcaps\">on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"sylct-b sc-1 jy-center\">on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</h4>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"opiniondates\">[June 28, 2024]</div>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"normal jy-both\"></p>\n<p class=\"casct-a jy-both\"><span class=\"smallcaps\"> Justice Sotomayor</span>, with whom <span class=\"smallcaps\">Justice Kagan</span> and <span class=\"smallcaps\">Justice Jackson</span> join, dissenting.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Sleep is a biological necessity, not a crime.  For some people, sleeping outside is their only option.  The City of Grants Pass jails and fines those people for sleeping anywhere in public at any time, including in their cars, if they use as little as a blanket to keep warm or a rolled-up shirt as a pillow.  For people with no access to shelter, that punishes them for being homeless.  That is unconscionable and unconstitutional.  Punishing people for their status is “cruel and unusual” under the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a>.  See <em>Robinson</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a aria-label=\"370 U.S. 660\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/370/660\">370 U.&nbsp;S. 660 (1962)</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Homelessness is a reality for too many Americans.  On any given night, over half a million people across the country lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence.  Many do not have access to shelters and are left to sleep in cars, sidewalks, parks, and other public places.  They experience homelessness due to complex and interconnected issues, including crippling debt and stagnant wages; domestic and sexual abuse; physical and psychiatric disabilities; and rising housing costs coupled with declining affordable housing options.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; At the same time, States and cities face immense challenges in responding to homelessness.  To address these challenges and provide for public health and safety, local governments need wide latitude, including to regulate when, where, and how homeless people sleep in public.  The decision below did, in fact, leave cities free to punish “littering, public urination or defecation, obstruction of roadways, possession or distribution of illicit substances, harassment, or violence.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. 200a.  The only question for the Court today is whether the Constitution permits punishing homeless people with no access to shelter for sleeping in public with as little as a blanket to keep warm.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> It is possible to acknowledge and balance the issues facing local governments, the humanity and dignity of homeless people, and our constitutional principles.  Instead, the majority focuses almost exclusively on the needs of local governments and leaves the most vulnerable in our society with an impossible choice: Either stay awake or be arrested.  The Constitution provides a baseline of rights for all Americans rich and poor, housed and unhoused.  This Court must safeguard those rights even when, and perhaps especially when, doing so is uncomfortable or unpopular.  Otherwise, “the words of the Constitution become little more than good advice.”  <em>Trop </em>v. <em>Dulles</em>, <a aria-label=\"356 U. S. 86\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/356/86\">356 U.&nbsp;S. 86</a>, 104 (1958) (plurality opinion).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">I</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The causes, consequences, and experiences of homelessness are complex and interconnected.  The majority paints a picture of “cities across the American West” in “crisis” that are using criminalization as a last resort.  <em>Ante</em>, at 1.  That narrative then animates the majority’s reasoning.  This account, however, fails to engage seriously with the precipitating causes of homelessness, the damaging effects of criminalization, and the myriad legitimate reasons people may lack or decline shelter.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">&nbsp;A</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Over 600,000 people experience homelessness in America on any given night, meaning that they lack “a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence.”  Dept. of Housing and Urban Development, T. de Sousa et&nbsp;al., The 2023 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress 4 (2023 AHAR).  These people experience homelessness in different ways.  Although 6 in 10 are able to secure shelter beds, the remaining 4 in 10 are unsheltered, sleeping “in places not meant for human habitation,” such as sidewalks, abandoned buildings, bus or train stations, camping grounds, and parked vehicles.  See <em>id</em>., at 2.  “Some sleep alone in public places, without any physical structures (like tents or shacks) or connection to services.  Others stay in encampments, which generally refer to groups of people living semipermanently in tents or other temporary structures in a public space.”  Brief for California as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>6 (California Brief ) (citation omitted).  This is in part because there has been a national “shortage of 188,000 shelter beds for individual adults.”  Brief for Service Providers as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 8 (Service Providers Brief ).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> People become homeless for many reasons, including some beyond their control.  “[S]tagnant wages and the lack of affordable housing” can mean some people are one unexpected medical bill away from being unable to pay rent.  Brief for Public Health Professionals and Organizations as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 3.  Every “$100 increase in median rental price” is “associated with about a 9 percent increase in the estimated homelessness rate.”  GAO, A. Cackley, Homelessness: Better HUD Oversight of Data Collection Could Improve Estimates of Homeless Populations 30 (GAO–20–433, 2020).  Individuals with disabilities, immigrants, and veterans face policies that increase housing instability.  See California Brief 7.  Natural disasters also play a role, including in Oregon, where increasing numbers of people &nbsp;“have lost housing because of climate events such as extreme wildfires across the state, floods in the coastal areas, [and] heavy snowstorms.”  2023 AHAR 52.  Further, “mental and physical health challenges,” and family and domestic “violence and abuse” can be precipitating causes of homelessness.  California Brief 7.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> People experiencing homelessness are young and old, live in families and as individuals, and belong to all races, cultures, and creeds.  Given the complex web of causes, it is unsurprising that the burdens of homelessness fall disproportionately on the most vulnerable in our society.  People already in precarious positions with mental and physical health, trauma, or abuse may have nowhere else to go if forced to leave their homes.  Veterans, victims of domestic violence, teenagers, and people with disabilities are all at an increased risk of homelessness.  For veterans, “those with a history of mental health conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. are at greater risk of homelessness.”  Brief for American Psychiatric Association et&nbsp;al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 6.  For women, almost 60% of those experiencing homelessness report that fleeing domestic violence was the “immediate cause.”  Brief for Advocates for Survivors of Gender-Based Violence as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 9.  For young people, “family dysfunction and rejection, sexual abuse, juvenile legal system involvement, ‘aging out’ of the foster care system, and economic hardship” make them particularly vulnerable to homelessness.  Brief for Juvenile Law Center et&nbsp;al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 2.  For American Indians, “policies of removal and resettlement in tribal lands” have caused displacement, resulting in “a disproportionately high rate of housing insecurity and unsheltered homelessness.”  Brief for StrongHearts Native Helpline et&nbsp;al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>10, 24.  For people with disabilities, “[l]ess than 5% of housing in the United States is accessible for moderate mobility disabilities, and less than 1% is accessi&nbsp;ble for wheelchair use.”  Brief for Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund et&nbsp;al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 2 (Disability Rights Brief&nbsp;).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> States and cities responding to the homelessness crisis face the difficult task of addressing the underlying causes of homelessness while also providing for public health and safety.  This includes, for example, dealing with the hazards posed by encampments, such as “a heightened risk of disease associated with living outside without bathrooms or wash basins,” “deadly fires” from efforts to “prepare food and create heat sources,” violent crime, and drug distribution and abuse.  California Brief 12.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Local governments need flexibility in responding to homelessness with effective and thoughtful solutions.  See <em>infra</em>, at 19–21.  Almost all of these policy solutions are beyond the scope of this case.  The only question here is whether the Constitution permits criminalizing sleeping outside when there is nowhere else to go.  That question is increasingly relevant because many local governments have made criminalization a frontline response to homelessness.  “[L]ocal measures to criminalize ‘acts of living’&nbsp;” by “prohibit[ing] sleeping, eating, sitting, or panhandling in public spaces” have recently proliferated.  U.&nbsp;S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, Searching Out Solutions 1 (2012).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Criminalizing homelessness can cause a destabilizing cascade of harm.  “Rather than helping people to regain housing, obtain employment, or access needed treatment and services, criminalization creates a costly revolving door that circulates individuals experiencing homelessness from the street to the criminal justice system and back.”  <em>Id</em>., at 6.  When a homeless person is arrested or separated from their property, for example, “items frequently destroyed in&nbsp;clude personal documents needed for accessing jobs, housing, and services such as IDs, driver’s licenses, financial documents, birth certificates, and benefits cards; items required for work such as clothing and uniforms, bicycles, tools, and computers; and irreplaceable mementos.”  Brief for 57 Social Scientists as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 17–18 (Social Scientists Brief&nbsp;).  Consider Erin Spencer, a disabled Marine Corps veteran who stores items he uses to make a living, such as tools and bike parts, in a cart.  He was arrested repeatedly for illegal lodging.  Each time, his cart and belongings were gone once he returned to the sidewalk.  “[T]he massive number of times the City or State has taken all I possess leaves me in a vacuous déjà vu.”  Brief for National Coalition for Homeless Veterans et&nbsp;al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>28.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Incarceration and warrants from unpaid fines can also result in the loss of employment, benefits, and housing options.  See Social Scientists Brief 13, 17 (incarceration and warrants can lead to “termination of federal health benefits such as Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid,” the “loss of a shelter bed,” or disqualification from “public housing and Section 8 vouchers”).  Finally, criminalization can lead homeless people to “avoid calling the police in the face of abuse or theft for fear of eviction from public space.”  <em>Id</em>., at 27.  Consider the tragic story of a homeless woman “who was raped almost immediately following a police move-along order that pushed her into an unfamiliar area in the dead of night.”  <em>Id.,</em> at 26.  She described her hesitation in calling for help: “What’s the point?  If I called them, they would have made all of us move [again].”  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> For people with nowhere else to go, fines and jail time do not deter behavior, reduce homelessness, or increase public safety.  In one study, 91% of homeless people who were surveyed “reported remaining outdoors, most often just moving two to three blocks away” when they received a move-along order.  <em>Id</em>., at 23.  Police officers in these cities recognize as much: “&nbsp;‘Look we’re not really solving anybody’s problem.  &nbsp;This is a big game of whack-a-mole.’&nbsp;”  <em>Id</em>., at 24.  Consider Jerry Lee, a Grants Pass resident who sleeps in a van.  Over the course of three days, he was woken up and cited six times for “camping in the city limits” just because he was sleeping in the van.  App. 99 (capitalization omitted).  Lee left the van each time only to return later to sleep.  Police reports eventually noted that he “continues to disregard the city ordinance and returns to the van to sleep as soon as police leave the area.  Dayshift needs to check on the van this morning and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. follow up for tow.”  <em>Ibid</em>. (same).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Shelter beds that are available in theory may be practically unavailable because of “restrictions based on gender, age, income, sexuality, religious practice, curfews that conflict with employment obligations, and time limits on stays.”  Social Scientists Brief 22.  Studies have shown, however, that the “vast majority of those who are unsheltered would move inside if safe and affordable options were available.”  Service Providers Brief 8 (collecting studies).  Consider CarrieLynn Hill.  She cannot stay at Gospel Rescue Mission, the only entity in Grants Pass offering temporary beds, because “she would have to check her nebulizer in as medical equipment and, though she must use it at least once every four hours, would not be able to use it in her room.”  Disability Rights Brief 18.  Similarly, Debra Blake’s “disabilities prevent her from working, which means she cannot comply with the Gospel Rescue Mission’s requirement that its residents work 40-hour work weeks.”  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Before I move on, consider one last example of a Nashville man who experienced homelessness for nearly 20 years.  When an outreach worker tried to help him secure housing, the worker had difficulty finding him for his appointments because he was frequently arrested for being homeless.  He was arrested 198 times and had over 250 charged citations, all for petty offenses.  The outreach worker made him a t-shirt that read “Please do not arrest me, my outreach &nbsp;worker is working on my housing.”  Service Providers Brief 16.  Once the worker was able to secure him stable housing, he “had no further encounters with the police, no citations, and no arrests.”  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> These and countless other stories reflect the reality of criminalizing sleeping outside when people have no other choice.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">II</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Grants Pass, a city of 38,000 people in southern Oregon, adopted three ordinances (Ordinances) that effectively make it unlawful to sleep anywhere in public, including in your car, at any time, with as little as a blanket or a rolled-up shirt as a pillow.  The Ordinances prohibit “[c]amping” on “any sidewalk, street, alley, lane, public right of way, park, bench, or any other publicly-owned property or under any bridge or viaduct.”  Grants Pass, Ore. Municipal Code §5.61.030 (2024).  A “[c]ampsite” is defined as “any place where bedding, sleeping bag, or other material used for bedding purposes, or any stove or fire is placed, established, or maintained for the purposes of maintaining a temporary place to live.”  §5.61.010(B).  Relevant here, the definition of “campsite” includes sleeping in “any vehicle.”  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Ordinances also prohibit camping in public parks, including the “[o]vernight parking” of any vehicle.  §6.46.090(B).<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Sotomayor Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-1\" id=\"DISSENT_6-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The City enforces these Ordinances with fines starting at $295 and increasing to $537.60 if unpaid.  Once a person is cited twice for violating park regulations within a 1-year period, city officers can issue an exclusion order barring that person from the park for 30 days.  See §6.46.350.  A &nbsp;person who camps in a park after receiving that order commits criminal trespass, which is punishable by a maximum of 30 days in jail and a $1,250 fine.  Ore. Rev. Stat. §164.245 (2023); see §§161.615(3), 161.635(1)(c).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In 2019, the Ninth Circuit held that “&nbsp;‘the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a> prohibits the imposition of criminal penalties for sitting, sleeping, or lying outside on public property for homeless individuals who cannot obtain shelter.’&nbsp;”  <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Boise</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/920_F.3d_584\">920 F.&nbsp;3d 584</a>, 616, cert. denied, 589 U.&nbsp;S. ___ (2019).  Considering an ordinance from Boise, Idaho, that made it a misdemeanor to use “streets, sidewalks, parks, or public places” for “camping,” <a aria-label=\"920 F.3d 603\" href=\"/rio/citation/920_F.3d_603\">920 F.&nbsp;3d, at 603</a>, the court concluded that “as long as there is no option of sleeping indoors, the government cannot criminalize indigent, homeless people for sleeping outdoors, on public property,” <em>id</em>., at 617.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Respondents here, two longtime residents of Grants Pass who are homeless and sleep in their cars, sued on behalf of themselves and all other involuntarily homeless people in the City, seeking to enjoin enforcement of the Ordinances.  The District Court eventually certified a class and granted summary judgment to respondents.  “As was the case in <em>Martin</em>, Grants Pass has far more homeless people than ‘practically available’ shelter beds.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. 179a.  The City had “zero emergency shelter beds,” and even counting the beds at the Gospel Rescue Mission (GRM), which is “the only entity in Grants Pass that offers any sort of temporary program for some class members,” “GRM’s 138 beds would not be nearly enough to accommodate the at least 602 homeless individuals in Grants Pass.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 179a–180a.  Thus, “the only way for homeless people to legally sleep on public property within the City is if they lay on the ground with only the clothing on their backs and without their items near them.”  <em>Id</em>., at 178a.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The District Court entered a narrow injunction.  It concluded that Grants Pass could “implement time and place restrictions for when homeless individuals may use their &nbsp;belongings to keep warm and dry and when they must have their belonging[s] packed up.”  <em>Id</em>., at 199a.  The City could also “ban the use of tents in public parks,” as long as it did not “ban people from using any bedding type materials to keep warm and dry while they sleep.”  <em>Id</em>., at 199a–200a.  Further, Grants Pass could continue to “enforce laws that actually further public health and safety, such as laws restricting littering, public urination or defecation, obstruction of roadways, possession or distribution of illicit substances, harassment, or violence.”  <em>Id.,</em> at 200a.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Ninth Circuit largely agreed that the Ordinances violated the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a> because they punished people who lacked “some place, such as [a] shelter, they can lawfully sleep.”  72 F. 4th 868, 894 (2023).  It further narrowed the District Court’s already-limited injunction.  The Ninth Circuit noted that, beyond prohibiting bedding, “the ordinances also prohibit the use of stoves or fires, as well as the erection of any structures.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 895.<em> </em>Because the record did not “establis[h that] the fire, stove, and structure prohibitions deprive homeless persons of sleep or ‘the most rudimentary precautions’ against the elements,” the court remanded for the District Court “to craft a narrower injunction recognizing Plaintiffs’ limited right to protection against the elements, as well as limitations when a shelter bed is available.”  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">III</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a> prohibits the infliction of “cruel and unusual punishments.”  Amdt. 8 (Punishments Clause).  This prohibition, which is not limited to medieval tortures, places “&nbsp;‘limitations’ on ‘the power of those entrusted with the criminal-law function of government.’&nbsp;”  <em>Timbs </em>v. <em>Indiana</em>, <a aria-label=\"586 U. S. 146\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/586/146\">586 U.&nbsp;S. 146</a>, 151 (2019).  The Punishments Clause “circumscribes the criminal process in three ways: First, it limits the kinds of punishment that can be imposed on those convicted of crimes; second, it proscribes &nbsp;punishment grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime; and third, it imposes substantive limits on what can be made criminal and punished as such.”  <em>Ingraham</em> v. <em>Wright</em>, <a aria-label=\"430 U. S. 651\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/430/651\">430 U.&nbsp;S. 651</a>, 667 (1977) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>California</em>, this Court detailed one substantive limitation on criminal punishment.  Lawrence Robinson was convicted under a California statute for “&nbsp;‘be[ing] addicted to the use of narcotics’&nbsp;” and faced a mandatory 90-day jail sentence.  370 U.&nbsp;S., at 660.  The California statute did not “punis[h] a person for the use of narcotics, for their purchase, sale or possession, or for antisocial or disorderly behavior resulting from their administration.”  <em>Id</em>., at 666.  Instead, it made “the ‘status’ of narcotic addiction a criminal offense, for which the offender may be prosecuted ‘at any time before he reforms.’&nbsp;”  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Court held that, because it criminalized the “&nbsp;‘status’ of narcotic addiction,” <em>ibid.</em>, the California law “inflict[ed] a cruel and unusual punishment in violation” of the Punishments Clause, <em>id</em>., at 667.  Importantly, the Court did not limit that holding to the status of narcotic addiction alone.  It began by reasoning that the criminalization of the “mentally ill, or a leper, or [those] afflicted with a venereal disease” “would doubtless be universally thought to be an infliction of cruel and unusual punishment.”  <em>Id</em>., at 666.  It extended that same reasoning to the status of being an addict, because “narcotic addiction is an illness” “which may be contracted innocently or involuntarily.”  <em>Id</em>., at 667.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Unlike the majority, see <em>ante, </em>at 15–17, the <em>Robinson </em>Court did not rely on the harshness of the criminal penalty itself.  It understood that “imprisonment for ninety days is not, in the abstract, a punishment which is either cruel or unusual.”  370 U.&nbsp;S., at 667.  Instead, it reasoned that, when imposed because of a person’s status, “[e]ven one day in prison would be a cruel and unusual punishment.”  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Robinson</em> did not prevent States from using a variety of tools, including criminal law, to address harmful conduct &nbsp;related to a particular status.  The Court candidly recognized the “vicious evils of the narcotics traffic” and acknowledged the “countless fronts on which those evils may be legitimately attacked.”  <em>Id</em>., at 667–668.  It left untouched the “broad power of a State to regulate the narcotic drugs traffic within its borders,” including the power to “impose criminal sanctions .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. against the unauthorized manufacture, prescription, sale, purchase, or possession of narcotics,” and the power to establish “a program of compulsory treatment for those addicted to narcotics.”  <em>Id</em>., at 664–665.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This Court has repeatedly cited <em>Robinson</em> for the proposition that the “<a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. imposes a substantive limit on what can be made criminal and punished as such.”  <em>Rhodes</em> v. <em>Chapman</em>, <a aria-label=\"452 U. S. 337\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/452/337\">452 U.&nbsp;S. 337</a>, 346, n. 12 (1981); see also <em>Gregg</em> v. <em>Georgia</em>, <a aria-label=\"428 U.

(“The substantive limits imposed by the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a> on what can be made criminal and punished were discussed in <em>Robinson</em>”).  Though it casts aspersions on <em>Robinson</em> and mistakenly treats it as an outlier, the majority does not overrule or reconsider that decision.<a aria-label=\"reference 2 of Sotomayor Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-2\" id=\"DISSENT_6-2ref\"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a>  Nor does the majority cast doubt on this Court’s firmly rooted principle that inflicting “unnecessary suffering” that is “grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime” or that serves no “penological purpose” violates the Punishments Clause.  <em>Estelle</em> v. <em>Gamble</em>, <a aria-label=\"429 U. S. 97\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/429/97\">429 U.&nbsp;S. 97</a>, 103, and n. 7 (1976).  Instead, the majority sees this case as requiring an application or extension of <em>Robinson</em>.  The majority’s understanding of <em>Robinson</em>, however,<em> </em>is plainly wrong.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">&nbsp;IV</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Grants Pass’s Ordinances criminalize being homeless.  The status of being homeless (lacking available shelter) is defined by the very behavior singled out for punishment (sleeping outside).  The majority protests that the Ordinances “do not criminalize mere status.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 21.  Saying so does not make it so.  Every shred of evidence points the other way.  The Ordinances’ purpose, text, and enforcement confirm that they target status, not conduct.  For someone with no available shelter, the only way to comply with the Ordinances is to leave Grants Pass altogether.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">A</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Start with their purpose.  The Ordinances, as enforced, are intended to criminalize being homeless.  The Grants Pass City Council held a public meeting in 2013 to “&nbsp;‘identify solutions to current vagrancy problems.’&nbsp;”  App. to Pet. for Cert. 168a.  The council discussed the City’s previous efforts to banish homeless people by “buying the person a bus ticket to a specific destination,” or transporting them to a different jurisdiction and “leaving them there.”  App. 113–114.  That was unsuccessful, so the council discussed other ideas, including a “&nbsp;‘do not serve’&nbsp;” list or “a ‘most unwanted list’ made by taking pictures of the offenders .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and then disseminating it to all the service agencies.”  <em>Id</em>., at 121.  The council even contemplated denying basic services such as “food, clothing, bedding, hygiene, and those types of things.”  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The idea was deterrence, not altruism.  “[U]ntil the pain of staying the same outweighs the pain of changing, people will not change; and some people need an external source to motivate that needed change.”  <em>Id</em>., at 119.  One councilmember opined that “[m]aybe they aren’t hungry enough or cold enough .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to make a change in their behavior.”  <em>Id</em>., at 122.  The council president summed up the goal succinctly: “&nbsp;‘[T]he point is to make it uncomfortable enough for &nbsp;[homeless people] in our city so they will want to move on down the road.’&nbsp;”  <em>Id</em>., at 114.<a aria-label=\"reference 3 of Sotomayor Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-3\" id=\"DISSENT_6-3ref\"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> One action item from this meeting was the “&nbsp;‘targeted enforcement of illegal camping’&nbsp;” against homeless people.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 169a.  “The year following the [public meeting] saw a significant increase in enforcement of the City’s anti-sleeping and anti-camping ordinances.  From 2013 through 2018, the City issued a steady stream of tickets under the ordinances.”  72 F. 4th, at 876–877.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Next consider the text.  The Ordinances by their terms single out homeless people.  They define “campsite” as “any place where bedding, sleeping bag, or other material used for bedding purposes” is placed “for the purpose of maintaining a temporary place to live.”  §5.61.010.  The majority claims that it “makes no difference whether the charged defendant is homeless.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 20.  Yet the Ordinances do not apply unless bedding is placed to maintain a temporary place to live.  Thus, “what separates prohibited conduct from permissible conduct is a person’s intent to ‘live’ in public spaces.  Infants napping in strollers, Sunday afternoon picnickers, and nighttime stargazers may all engage in the same conduct of bringing blankets to public spaces [and sleeping], but they are exempt from punishment because they have a separate ‘place to live’ to which they presuma&nbsp;bly intend to return.”  Brief for Criminal Law and Punishment Scholars as <em>Amici Curiae </em>12. </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Put another way, the Ordinances single out for punishment the activities that define the status of being homeless.  By most definitions, homeless individuals are those that lack “a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence.”  <a aria-label=\"42 USC 11434a 2 A\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/11434a#2_A\">42 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §11434a(2)(A)</a>; <a aria-label=\"24 CFR\" href=\"/cfr/text/24\">24</a> CFR §§582.5, 578.3 (2023).  Permitting Grants Pass to criminalize sleeping outside with as little as a blanket permits Grants Pass to criminalize homelessness.  “There is no .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. separation between being without available indoor shelter and sleeping in public—they are opposite sides of the same coin.”  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 25.  The Ordinances use the definition of “campsite” as a proxy for homelessness because those lacking “a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence” are those who need to sleep in public to “maintai[n] a temporary place to live.”  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Take the respondents here, two longtime homeless residents of Grants Pass who sleep in their cars.  The Ordinances define “campsite” to include “any vehicle.”  §5.61.010(B).  For respondents, the Ordinances as applied do not criminalize any behavior or conduct related to encampments (such as fires or tents).  Instead, the Ordinances target respondents’ status as people without any other form of shelter.  Under the majority’s logic, cities cannot criminalize the status of being homeless, but they can criminalize the conduct that defines that status.  The Constitution cannot be evaded by such formalistic distinctions.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Ordinances’ definition of “campsite” creates a situation where homeless people necessarily break the law just by existing.  “[U]nsheltered people have no private place to survive, so they are virtually guaranteed to violate these pervasive laws.”  S. Rankin, Hiding Homelessness: The Transcarceration of Homelessness, 109 <span class=\"smallcaps\">C</span>al<span class=\"smallcaps\">.</span> <span class=\"smallcaps\">L.&nbsp;R</span>ev<span class=\"smallcaps\">.</span> 559, 561 (2021); see also Disability Rights Brief 2 (“[T]he members of Grants Pass’s homeless community do not choose to &nbsp;be homeless.  Instead, in a city with no public shelters, they have no alternative but to sleep in parks or on the street”).  Every human needs to sleep at some point.  Even if homeless people with no available shelter options can exist for a few days in Grants Pass without sleeping, they eventually must leave or be criminally punished.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The majority resists this understanding, arguing that the Ordinances criminalize the conduct of being homeless in Grants Pass while sleeping with as little as a blanket.  Therefore, the argument goes, “[r]ather than criminalize mere status, Grants Pass forbids actions.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 20.  With no discussion about what it means to criminalize “status” or “conduct,” the majority’s analysis consists of a few sentences repeating its conclusion again and again in hopes that it will become true.  See <em>ante,</em> at 20–21 (proclaiming that the Ordinances “forbi[d] actions” “[r]ather than criminalize mere status”; and that they “do not criminalize mere status”).  The best the majority can muster is the following tautology: The Ordinances criminalize conduct, not pure status, because they apply to conduct, not status.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The flaw in this conclusion is evident.  The majority countenances the criminalization of status as long as the City tacks on an essential bodily function—blinking, sleeping, eating, or breathing.  That is just another way to ban the person.  By this logic, the majority would conclude that the ordinance deemed unconstitutional in <em>Robinson</em> criminalizing “being an addict” would be constitutional if it criminalized “being an addict and breathing.”  Or take the example in <em>Robinson</em>: “Even one day in prison would be a cruel and unusual punishment for the ‘crime’ of having a common cold.”  370 U.&nbsp;S., at 667.  According to the majority, although it is cruel and unusual to punish someone for having a common cold, it is not cruel and unusual to punish them for sniffling or coughing because of that cold.  See <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Caldwell</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/930_F.3d_264\">930 F.&nbsp;3d 264</a>, 290 (CA4 2019) (Wilkinson, J., dissenting) (“In the rare case where the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a> &nbsp;was found to invalidate a criminal law, the law in question sought to punish persons merely for their need to eat or sleep, which are essential bodily functions.  This is simply a variation of <em>Robinson</em>’s command that the state identify conduct in crafting its laws, rather than punish a person’s mere existence” (citation omitted)).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">C</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The Ordinances are enforced exactly as intended: to criminalize the status of being homeless.  City officials sought to use the Ordinances to drive homeless people out of town.  See <em>supra</em>, at 13–14.  The message to homeless residents is clear.  As Debra Blake, a named plaintiff who passed away while this case was pending, see n.&nbsp;1, <em>supra</em>, shared:</p>\n<p class=\"bqbegin jy-both\"> “I have been repeatedly told by Grants Pass police that I must ‘move along’ and that there is nowhere in Grants Pass that I can legally sit or rest.  I have been repeatedly awakened by Grants Pass police while sleeping and told that I need to get up and move.  I have been told by Grants Pass police that I should leave town.</p>\n<p class=\"bqend jy-both\"> Because I have no choice but to live outside and have no place else to go, I have gotten tickets, fines and have been criminally prosecuted for being homeless.”  App. 180–181.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">Debra Blake’s heartbreaking message captures the cruelty of criminalizing someone for their status: “I am afraid at all times in Grants Pass that I could be arrested, ticketed and prosecuted for sleeping outside or for covering myself with a blanket to stay warm.”  <em>Id</em>., at 182.  So, at times, when she could, Blake “slept outside of the city.”  <em>Ibid.</em>  Blake, who was disabled, unemployed, and elderly, “owe[d] the City of Grants Pass more than $5000 in fines for crimes and violations related directly to [her] involuntary homelessness and the fact that there is no affordable housing or emergency &nbsp;shelters in Grants Pass where [she could] stay.”  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Another homeless individual was found outside a nonprofit “in severe distress outside in the frigid air.”  <em>Id</em>., at 109.  “[H]e could not breathe and he was experiencing acute pain,” and he “disclosed fear that he would be arrested and trespassed again for being outside.”  <em>Ibid</em>.  Another, CarrieLynn Hill, whose story you read earlier, see <em>supra</em>, at 7, was ticketed for “lying down on a friend’s mat” and “lying down under a tarp to stay warm.”  App. 134.  She was “constantly afraid” of being “cited and arrested for being outside in Grants Pass.”  <em>Ibid</em>.  She is unable to stay at the only shelter in the City because she cannot keep her nebulizer, which she needs throughout the night, in her room.  So she does “not know of anywhere in the city of Grants Pass where [she] can safely sleep or rest without being arrested, trespassed, or moved along.”  <em>Id</em>., at 135.  As she put it: “The only way I have figured out how to get by is try to stay out of sight and out of mind.”  <em>Ibid.</em>  Stories like these fill the record and confirm the City’s success in targeting the status of being homeless.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The majority proclaims, with no citation, that “it makes no difference whether the charged defendant is homeless, a backpacker on vacation passing through town, or a student who abandons his dorm room to camp out in protest.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 20.  That describes a fantasy.  In reality, the deputy chief of police operations acknowledged that he was not aware of “any non-homeless person ever getting a ticket for illegal camping in Grants Pass.”  Tr. of Jim Hamilton in <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Grants Pass</em>, No. 1:18–cr–01823 (D Ore., Oct. 16, 2019), ECF Doc. 63–4, p. 16.  Officers testified that “laying on a blanket enjoying the park” would not violate the ordinances, ECF Doc. 63–7, at 2; and that bringing a sleeping bag to “look at stars” would not be punished, ECF Doc. 63–5, at 5.  Instead, someone violates the Ordinance only if he or she does not “have another home to go to.”  <em>Id.,</em> at 6.  That is the definition of being homeless.  The majority does not &nbsp;contest any of this.  So much for the Ordinances applying to backpackers and students.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">V</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> <em>Robinson </em>should squarely resolve this case.  Indeed, the majority seems to agree that an ordinance that fined and jailed “homeless” people would be unconstitutional.  See <em>ante,</em> at 21 (disclaiming that the Ordinances “criminalize mere status”).  The majority resists a straightforward application of <em>Robinson</em> by speculating about policy considerations and fixating on extensions of the Ninth Circuit’s narrow rule in <em>Martin</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The majority is wrong on all accounts.  First, no one contests the power of local governments to address homelessness.  Second, the majority overstates the line-drawing problems that this case presents.  Third, a straightforward application of <em>Robinson </em>does not conflict with <em>Powell</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a aria-label=\"392 U.S. 514\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/392/514\">392 U.&nbsp;S. 514 (1968)</a>.  Finally, the majority draws the wrong message from the various <em>amici </em>requesting this Court’s guidance.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">A</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> No one contests that local governments can regulate the time, place, and manner of public sleeping pursuant to their power to “enact regulations in the interest of the public safety, health, welfare or convenience.”  <em>Schneider</em> v. <em>State (Town of Irvington)</em>, <a aria-label=\"308 U. S. 147\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/308/147\">308 U.&nbsp;S. 147</a>, 160 (1939).  This power includes controlling “the use of public streets and sidewalks, over which a municipality must rightfully exercise a great deal of control in the interest of traffic regulation and public safety.”  <em>Shuttlesworth</em> v. <em>Birmingham</em>, <a aria-label=\"394 U. S. 147\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/394/147\">394 U.&nbsp;S. 147</a>, 152 (1969).  When exercising that power, however, regulations still “may not abridge the individual liberties secured by the Constitution.”  <em>Schneider</em>, 308 U.&nbsp;S., at 160.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"><em> </em>The Ninth Circuit in <em>Martin </em>provided that “an ordinance &nbsp;violates the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a> insofar as it imposes criminal sanctions against homeless individuals for sleeping outdoors, on public property, when no alternative shelter is available to them.”  <a aria-label=\"920 F.3d 604\" href=\"/rio/citation/920_F.3d_604\">920 F.&nbsp;3d, at 604</a>.  <em>Martin </em>was narrow.<a aria-label=\"reference 4 of Sotomayor Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-4\" id=\"DISSENT_6-4ref\"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup></a>  Consider these qualifications:</p>\n<p class=\"bqonly1para jy-both\">“[O]ur holding does not cover individuals who <em>do </em>have access to adequate temporary shelter, whether because they have the means to pay for it or because it is realistically available to them for free, but who choose not to use it.  Nor do we suggest that a jurisdiction with insufficient shelter can <em>never </em>criminalize the act of sleeping outside.  Even where shelter is unavailable, an ordinance prohibiting sitting, lying, or sleeping outside at particular times or in particular locations might well be constitutionally permissible.  So, too, might an ordinance barring the obstruction of public rights of way or the erection of certain structures.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 617, n.&nbsp;8 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">Upholding <em>Martin </em>does not call into question all the other tools that a city has to deal with homelessness.  “Some cities have established approved encampments on public property with security, services, and other resources; others have sought to impose geographic and time-limited bans on public sleeping; and others have worked to clear and clean particularly dangerous encampments after providing notice and reminders to those who lived there.”  California Brief 14.  Others might “limit the use of fires, whether for cooking or other purposes” or “ban (or enforce already-existing bans on) particular conduct that negatively affects other people, including harassment of passersby, illegal drug use, and littering.”  Brief for Maryland et&nbsp;al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>12.  All &nbsp;of these tools remain available to localities seeking to address homelessness within constitutional bounds.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The scope of this dispute is narrow.  Respondents do not challenge the City’s “restrictions on the use of tents or other camping gear,” “encampment clearances,” “time and place restrictions on sleeping outside,” or “the imposition of fines or jail time on homeless people who decline accessible shelter options.”  Brief for Respondents 18.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> That means the majority does not need to answer most of the hypotheticals it poses.  The City’s hypotheticals, echoed throughout the majority opinion, concern “violent crime, drug overdoses, disease, fires, and hazardous waste.”  Brief for Petitioner 47.  For the most part, these concerns are not implicated in this case.  The District Court’s injunction, for example, permits the City to prohibit “littering, public urination or defecation, obstruction of roadways, possession or distribution of illicit substances, harassment, or violence.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. 200a.  The majority’s framing of the problem as one involving drugs, diseases, and fires instead of one involving people trying to keep warm outside with a blanket just provides the Court with cover to permit the criminalization of homeless people.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The majority also overstates the line-drawing problems that a baseline <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a> standard presents.  Consider the “unavoidable” “difficult questions” that discombobulate the majority.  <em>Ante,</em> at 32–33.  Courts answer such factual questions every day.  For example, the majority asks: “What does it mean to be ‘involuntarily’ homeless with ‘no place to go’?”  <em>Ibid</em>.  <em>Martin</em>’s answer was clear: It is when “&nbsp;‘there is a greater number of homeless individuals in [a city] than the number of available beds [in shelters,]’&nbsp;” not including “individuals who <em>do</em> have access to adequate temporary shelter, whether because they have the means to pay for it or because it is realistically available to them &nbsp;for free.”  <a aria-label=\"920 F.3d 617\" href=\"/rio/citation/920_F.3d_617\">920 F.&nbsp;3d, at 617</a>, and n.&nbsp;8.  The District Court here found that Grants Pass had “zero emergency shelter beds” and that Gospel Rescue Mission’s “138 beds would not be nearly enough to accommodate the at least 602 homeless individuals in Grants Pass.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. 179a–180a.  The majority also asks: “[W]hat are people entitled to do and use in public spaces to ‘keep warm’&nbsp;”?  <em>Ante,</em> at 33.  The District Court’s opinion also provided a clear answer: They are permitted “bedding type materials to keep warm and dry,” but cities can still “implement time and place restrictions for when homeless individuals .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. must have their belonging[s] packed up.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. 199a.  Ultimately, these are not metaphysical questions but factual ones.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <a aria-label=\"42 USC 11302\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/11302\">42 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §11302</a> (defining “homeless,” “homeless individual,” and “homeless person”); <a aria-label=\"24 CFR\" href=\"/cfr/text/24\">24</a> CFR §582.5 (defining “[a]n individual or family who lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence”).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Just because the majority can list difficult questions that require answers, see <em>ante,</em> at 33, n.&nbsp;8, does not absolve federal judges of the responsibility to interpret and enforce the substantive bounds of the Constitution.  The majority proclaims that this dissent “blinks the difficult questions.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 32.  The majority should open its eyes to available answers instead of throwing up its hands in defeat.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">C</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The majority next spars with a strawman in its discussion of <em>Powell</em> v. <em>Texas</em>.  The Court in <em>Powell</em> considered the distinction between status and conduct but could not agree on a controlling rationale.  Four Justices concluded that <em>Robinson </em>covered any “condition [the defendant] is powerless to change,” 392 U.&nbsp;S., at 567 (Fortas, J., dissenting), and four Justices rejected that view.  Justice White, casting the decisive fifth vote, left the question open because the defendant had “made no showing that he was unable to stay off the streets on the night in question.”  <em>Id</em>., at 554 (opinion &nbsp;concurring in judgment).  So, in his view, it was “unnecessary to pursue at this point the further definition of the circumstances or the state of intoxication which might bar conviction of a chronic alcoholic for being drunk in a public place.”  <em>Id</em>., at 553.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This case similarly called for a straightforward application of <em>Robinson</em>.  The majority finds it telling that this dissent “barely mentions” Justice Marshall’s opinion in <em>Powell</em>.  <em>Ante,</em> at 32.<a aria-label=\"reference 5 of Sotomayor Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-5\" id=\"DISSENT_6-5ref\"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup></a>  The majority completely misses the point.  Even Justice Marshall’s plurality opinion in <em>Powell</em> agreed that <em>Robinson </em>prohibited enforcing laws criminalizing “a mere status.”  392 U.&nbsp;S., at 532.  The <em>Powell </em>Court considered a statute that criminalized voluntary conduct (getting drunk) that could be rendered involuntary by a status (alcoholism); here, the Ordinances criminalize conduct (sleeping outside) that defines a particular status (homelessness).  So unlike the debate in <em>Powell</em>, this case does not turn on whether the criminalized actions are “&nbsp;‘involuntary’ or ‘occasioned by’&nbsp;” a particular status.  <em>Id</em>., at 533 (Marshall, J., dissenting).  For all the reasons discussed above, see <em>supra,</em> at 13–19, these Ordinances criminalize status and are thus unconstitutional under any of the opinions in <em>Powell</em>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">D</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The majority does not let the reader forget that “a large number of States, cities, and counties” all “urg[ed] the Court to grant review.”<em>  Ante</em>, at 14; see also <em>ante,</em> at 9 (“An exceptionally large number of cities and States have filed briefs in this Court”); <em>ante,</em> at 34 (noting the “multitude of <em>amicus</em> briefs before us”); <em>ante,</em> at 14, n. 3 (listing certiorari-stage <em>amici</em>).  No one contests that States, cities, and counties could benefit from this Court’s guidance.  Yet the majority relies on these <em>amici</em> to shift the goalposts and focus on policy questions beyond the scope of this case.  It first declares that “[t]he only question we face is whether one specific provision of the Constitution .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. prohibits the enforcement of public-camping laws.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 31.  Yet it quickly shifts gears and claims that “the question this case presents is whether the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a> grants federal judges primary responsibility for assessing those causes [of homelessness] and devising those responses.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 34.  This sleight of hand allows the majority to abdicate its responsibility to answer the first (legal) question by declining to answer the second (policy) one.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The majority cites various <em>amicus</em> briefs to amplify Grants Pass’s belief that its homelessness crisis is intractable absent the ability to criminalize homelessness.  In so doing, the majority chooses to see only what it wants.  Many of those stakeholders support the narrow rule in <em>Martin</em>.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., Brief for City and County of San Francisco et&nbsp;al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 4 (“[U]nder the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a>  .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a local municipality may not prohibit sleeping—a biological necessity—in all public spaces at all times and under all conditions, if there is no alternative space available in the jurisdiction for unhoused people to sleep”); Brief for City of Los Angeles as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>1 (“The City agrees with the broad premise underlying the <em>Martin </em>and <em>Johnson </em>decisions: when a person has no other place to sleep, sleeping at night in a public space should not be a crime leading to an arrest, criminal conviction, or jail”); California Brief 2–3 (“[T]he Constitution does not allow the government to punish people for the status of being homeless.  Nor should it allow the government to effectively punish the status of being homeless by making it a crime in all events for someone with no other options to sleep outside on public property at &nbsp;night”).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Even the Federal Government, which restricts some sleeping activities on park lands, see <em>ante,</em> at 7, has for nearly three decades “taken the position that laws prohibiting sleeping in public at all times and in all places violate the <em>Robinson </em>principle as applied to individuals who have no access to shelter.”  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 14.  The same is true of States across the Nation.  See Brief for Maryland et&nbsp;al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>3–4 (“Taking these policies [criminalizing homelessness] off the table does not interfere with our ability to address homelessness (including the effects of homelessness on surrounding communities) using other policy tools, nor does it amount to an undue intrusion on state sovereignty”).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Nothing in today’s decision prevents these States, cities, and counties from declining to criminalize people for sleeping in public when they have no available shelter.  Indeed, although the majority describes <em>Martin </em>as adopting an unworkable rule, the elected representatives in Oregon codified that very rule.  See <em>infra</em>, at 26.  The majority does these localities a disservice by ascribing to them a demand for unfettered freedom to punish that many do not seek.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">VI</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The Court wrongly concludes that the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a> permits Ordinances that effectively criminalize being homeless.  Grants Pass’s Ordinances may still raise a host of other legal issues.  Perhaps recognizing the untenable position it adopts, the majority stresses that “many substantive legal protections and provisions of the Constitution may have important roles to play when States and cities seek to enforce their laws against the homeless.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 31.  That is true.  Although I do not prejudge the merits of these other issues, I detail some here so that people experiencing homelessness and their advocates do not take the &nbsp;Court’s decision today as closing the door on such claims.<a aria-label=\"reference 6 of Sotomayor Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-6\" id=\"DISSENT_6-6ref\"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">A</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The Court today does not decide whether the Ordinances are valid under a new Oregon law that codifies <em>Martin</em>.  In 2021, Oregon passed a law that constrains the ability of municipalities to punish homeless residents for public sleeping.  “Any city or county law that regulates the acts of sitting, lying, sleeping or keeping warm and dry outdoors on public property that is open to the public must be objectively reasonable as to time, place and manner with regards to persons experiencing homelessness.”  Ore. Rev. Stat. §195.530(2).  The law also grants persons “experiencing homelessness” a cause of action to “bring suit for injunctive or declaratory relief to challenge the objective reasonableness” of an ordinance.  §195.530(4).  This law was meant to “&nbsp;‘ensure that individuals experiencing homelessness are protected from fines or arrest for sleeping or camping on public property when there are no other options.’&nbsp;”  Brief in Opposition 35 (quoting Speaker T. Kotek, Hearing on H. B. 3115 before the House Committee on the Judiciary, 2021 Reg. Sess. (Ore., Mar. 9, 2021)).  The panel below already concluded that “[t]he city ordinances addressed in <em>Grants Pass </em>will be superseded, to some extent,” by this new law.  72 F. 4th, at 924, n.&nbsp;7.  Courts may need to determine whether and how the new law limits the City’s enforcement of its Ordinances.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The Court today also does not decide whether the Ordinances violate the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution eighth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment\">Eighth Amendment</a>’s Excessive Fines Clause.  That Clause separately “limits the government’s &nbsp;power to extract payments, whether in cash or in kind, as punishment for some offense.”  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Bajakajian</em>, <a aria-label=\"524 U. S. 321\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/524/321\">524 U.&nbsp;S. 321</a>, 328 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted).  “The touchstone of the constitutional inquiry under the Excessive Fines Clause is the principle of proportionality: The amount of the forfeiture must bear some relationship to the gravity of the offense that it is designed to punish.”  <em>Id</em>., at 334.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The District Court in this case concluded that the fines here serve “no remedial purpose” but rather are “intended to deter homeless individuals from residing in Grants Pass.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. 189a.  Because it concluded that the fines are punitive, it went on to determine that the fines are “&nbsp;‘grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the offense’&nbsp;” and thus excessive.  <em>Ibid.  </em>The Ninth Circuit declined to consider this holding because the City presented “no meaningful argument on appeal regarding the excessive fines issue.”  72 F. 4th, at 895.  On remand, the Ninth Circuit is free to consider whether the City forfeited its appeal on this ground and, if not, whether this issue has merit.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">C</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Finally, the Court does not decide whether the Ordinances violate the Due Process Clause.  “The Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and <a aria-label=\"US Constitution Amendment xiv\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv\">Fourteenth Amendment</a>s ensure that officials may not displace certain rules associated with criminal liability that are ‘so old and venerable,’ ‘&nbsp;“so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people[,] as to be ranked as fundamental.”&nbsp;’&nbsp;”  <em>Ante,</em> at 15 (quoting <em>Kahler</em> v. <em>Kansas</em>, <a aria-label=\"589 U. S. 271\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/589/271\">589 U.&nbsp;S. 271</a>, 279 (2020)).  The majority notes that due process arguments in <em>Robinson </em>“may have made some sense.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 19.  On that score, I agree.  “[H]istorically, crimes in England and this country have usually required proof of some act (or <em>actus reus</em>) undertaken with some measure of volition (<em>mens rea</em>).”  <em>Ibid</em>.  “This view ‘took deep &nbsp;and early root in American soil’ where, to this day, a crime ordinarily arises ‘only from concurrence of an evil-meaning mind with an evil-doing hand.’  <em>Morissette</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"342 U. S. 246\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/342/246\">342 U.&nbsp;S. 246</a>, 251–252 (1952).”  <em>Ibid</em>.  Yet the law at issue in <em>Robinson </em>“was an anomaly, as it required proof of neither of those things.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 19.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Relatedly, this Court has concluded that some vagrancy laws are unconstitutionally vague.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Kolender</em> v. <em>Lawson</em>, <a aria-label=\"461 U.

Other potentially relevant due process precedents abound.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Winters</em> v. <em>New York</em>, <a aria-label=\"333 U.

People experiencing homelessness face immense challenges, as do local and state governments.

It is cruel and unusual to apply any penalty “selectively to minorities whose numbers are few, who are outcasts of society, and who are unpopular, but whom society is willing to see suffer though it would not countenance general application of the same penalty across the board.”  <em>Furman </em>v. <em>Georgia</em>, <a aria-label=\"408 U.

That responsibility is shared by those vulnerable populations, the States and cities in which they reside, and each and every one of us.  “It is only after we begin to see a street as <em>our</em> street, a public park as <em>our</em> park, a school as <em>our</em> school, that we can become engaged citizens, dedicating our time and resources for worthwhile causes.”  M. Desmond, Evicted: Property and Profit in the American City 294 (2016).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This Court, too, has a role to play in faithfully enforcing the Constitution to prohibit punishing the very existence of those without shelter.  I remain hopeful that someday in the near future, this Court will play its role in safeguarding constitutional liberties for the most vulnerable among us.  Because the Court today abdicates that role, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<h3 class=\"fnheader\">Notes</h3>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_6-1\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Sotomayor Dissent at reference 1\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-1ref\">1</a> &nbsp;The City’s “sleeping” ordinance prohibits sleeping “on public sidewalks, streets, or alleyways at any time as a matter of individual and public safety.”  §5.61.020(A).

Targeted enforcement of the Ordinances to criminalize homelessness was only one solution discussed at the meeting.  See App. 131–132 (listing “[a]ctions to move forward,” including increasing police presence, exclusion zones, “zero tolerance” signs, “do not serve” or “most unwanted” lists, trespassing letters, and building a sobering center or youth center (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_6-4\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Sotomayor Dissent at reference 4\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-4ref\">4</a> &nbsp;Some district courts have since interpreted <em>Martin</em> broadly, relying on it to enjoin time, place, and manner restrictions on camping outside.

Respondent Purdue Pharma sits at the center of that crisis.  Owned and controlled by the Sackler family, Purdue began marketing OxyContin, an opioid prescription pain reliever, in the mid-1990s.  After Purdue earned billions of dollars in sales on the drug, in 2007 one of its affiliates pleaded guilty to a federal felony for misbranding OxyContin as a less-addictive, less-abusable alternative to other pain medications.  Thousands of lawsuits followed.  Fearful that the litigation would eventually impact them directly, the Sacklers initiated a “milking program,” withdrawing from Purdue approximately $11 billion—roughly 75% of the firm’s total assets—over the next decade.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-d jy-both indent_l-187 indent_h-187\">  Those withdrawals left Purdue in a significantly weakened financial state.  And in 2019, Purdue filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  During that process, the Sacklers proposed to return approximately $4.3 billion to Purdue’s bankruptcy estate.  In exchange, the Sackers sought a judicial order releasing the family from all opioid-related claims and enjoining victims from bringing such claims against them in the future.  The bankruptcy court approved Purdue’s proposed reorganization plan, including its provisions concerning the Sackler discharge.  But the district court vacated that decision, holding that nothing in the law authorizes bankruptcy courts to extinguish claims against third parties like the Sacklers, without the claimants’ consent.  A divided panel of the Second Circuit reversed the district court and revived the bankruptcy court’s order approving a modified reorganization plan.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-e jy-both\"><em>Held</em>:&nbsp;The bankruptcy code does not authorize a release and injunction &nbsp;that, as part of a plan of reorganization under Chapter 11, effectively seek to discharge claims against a nondebtor without the consent of affected claimants.  Pp.&nbsp;7–19.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> (a)&nbsp;When a debtor files for bankruptcy, it “creates an estate” that includes virtually all the debtor’s assets.  <a aria-label=\"11 USC 541 a\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/541#a\">11 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §541(a)</a>.  Under Chapter 11, the debtor must develop a reorganization plan governing the distribution of the estate’s assets and present it to the bankruptcy court for approval.  §§1121, 1123, 1129, 1141.  A bankruptcy court’s order confirming a reorganization plan “discharges the debtor” of certain pre-petition debts.  §1141(d)(1)(A).  In this case, the Sacklers have not filed for bankruptcy or placed all their assets on the table for distribution to creditors, yet they seek what essentially amounts to a discharge.  No provision of the code authorizes that kind of relief.  Pp.&nbsp;7–17.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\">  (1)&nbsp; Section 1123(b) addresses the kinds of provisions that may be included in a Chapter 11 plan.  That section contains five specific paragraphs, followed by a catchall provision.  The first five paragraphs all concern the debtor’s rights and responsibilities, as well as its relationship with its creditors.  The catchall provides that a plan “may” also “include any other appropriate provision not inconsistent with the applicable provisions of this title.”  All agree that the first five paragraphs do not authorize the Sackler discharge.  But, according to the plan proponents and the Second Circuit, paragraph (6) broadly permits any term not expressly forbidden by the code so long as a judge deems it “appropriate.”  Because provisions like the Sackler discharge are not expressly prohibited, they reason, paragraph (6) necessarily permits them.  That is not correct.  When faced with a catchall phrase like paragraph (6), courts do not necessarily afford it the broadest possible construction it can bear.  <em>Epic Systems Corp.</em> v. <em>Lewis</em>, <a aria-label=\"584 U. S. 497\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/584/497\">584 U.&nbsp;S. 497</a>, 512.  Instead, we generally appreciate that the catchall must be interpreted in light of its surrounding context and read to “embrace only objects similar in nature” to the specific examples preceding it.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Here, each of the preceding paragraphs concerns the rights and responsibilities of the debtor; and they authorize a bankruptcy court to adjust claims without consent only to the extent such claims concern the debtor.  While paragraph (6) doubtlessly confers additional authorities on a bankruptcy court, it cannot be read under the canon of <em>ejusdem generis</em> to endow a bankruptcy court with the “radically different” power to discharge the debts of a nondebtor without the consent of affected claimants.  <em>Epic Systems Corp.</em>, 584 U.&nbsp;S., at 513.  And while the dissent reaches a contrary conclusion, it does so only by elevating its view of the bankruptcy code’s purported purpose over the text’s clear focus on the debtor.  Pp.&nbsp;7–13.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\">&nbsp;  (2)&nbsp;The code’s statutory scheme further forecloses the Sackler discharge.  The code generally reserves discharge for a debtor who places substantially all of their assets on the table.  §1141(d)(1)(A); see also §541(a).  And, ordinarily, it does not include claims based on “fraud” or those alleging “willful and malicious injury.”  §§523(a)(2), (4), (6).  The Sackler discharge defies these limitations.  The Sacklers have not filed for bankruptcy, nor have they placed virtually all their assets on the table for distribution to creditors.  Yet, they seek an order discharging a broad sweep of present and future claims against them, including ones for fraud and willful injury.  In all of these ways, the Sacklers seek to pay less than the code ordinarily requires and receive more than it normally permits.  Contrary to the dissent’s suggestion, plan proponents cannot evade these limitations simply by rebranding their discharge a “release.”  Pp.&nbsp;13–16.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\">  (3)&nbsp;History offers a final strike against the plan proponents’ construction of §1123(b)(6).  Pre-code practice, we have said, may sometimes inform the meaning of the code’s more “ambiguous” provisions.  <em>RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC</em> v. <em>Amalgamated Bank</em>, <a aria-label=\"566 U. S. 639\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/566/639\">566 U. S. 639</a>, 649.  And every bankruptcy law cited by the parties and their <em>amici</em>—from 1800 until the enactment of the present bankruptcy code in 1978—generally reserved the benefits of discharge to the debtor who offered a “fair and full surrender of [its] property.”  <em>Sturges</em> v. <em>Crowninshield</em>, 4 Wheat. 122, 176.  Had Congress meant to reshape traditional practice so profoundly in the present bankruptcy code, extending to courts the capacious new power the plan proponents claim, one might have expected it to say so expressly “somewhere in the [c]ode itself.”  <em>Dewsnup</em> v. <em>Timm</em>, <a aria-label=\"502 U. S. 410\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/502/410\">502 U.&nbsp;S. 410</a>, 420.  Pp.&nbsp;16–17.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> (b)&nbsp;In the end, the plan proponents default to policy.  The Sacklers, they say, will not return any funds to Purdue’s estate unless the bankruptcy court grants them the sweeping nonconsensual release and injunction they seek.  Without the Sackler discharge, they predict, victims will be left without any means of recovery.  But the U.&nbsp;S. Trustee disagrees.  As he tells it, the potentially massive liability the Sacklers face may induce them to negotiate for <em>consensual</em> releases on terms more favorable to all the claimants.  In addition, the Trustee warns, a ruling for the Sacklers would provide a roadmap for tortfeasors to misuse the bankruptcy system in future cases.  While both sides may have their points, this Court is the wrong audience for such policy disputes.  Our only proper task is to interpret and apply the law; and nothing in present law authorizes the Sackler discharge.  Pp.&nbsp;17–19.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> (c)&nbsp;Today’s decision is a narrow one.  Nothing in the opinion should be construed to call into question consensual third-party releases offered in connection with a bankruptcy reorganization plan.  Nor does the Court express a view on what qualifies as a consensual release or &nbsp;pass upon a plan that provides for the full satisfaction of claims against a third-party nondebtor.  Additionally, because this case involves only a stayed reorganization plan, the Court does not address whether its reading of the bankruptcy code would justify unwinding reorganization plans that have already become effective and been substantially consummated.  Confining ourselves to the question presented, the Court holds only that the bankruptcy code does not authorize a release and injunction that, as part of a plan of reorganization under Chapter 11, effectively seeks to discharge claims against a nondebtor without the consent of affected claimants.  Because the Second Circuit held otherwise, its judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

But beneath that complexity lies a simple bargain:  A debtor can win a discharge of its debts if it proceeds with honesty and places virtually all its assets on the table for its creditors.  The debtor in this case, Purdue Pharma L.&nbsp;P., filed for bankruptcy after facing a wave of litigation for its role in the opioid epidemic.  Purdue’s long-time owners, members of the Sackler family, confronted a growing number of suits too.  But instead of declaring bankruptcy, they chose a different path.  From the court overseeing Purdue’s bankruptcy, they sought and won an order extinguishing vast numbers of existing and potential claims against them.  They obtained all this without securing the consent of those affected or placing anything approaching their total assets on the table for their creditors.

Department of Health and Human Services estimates that the opioid epidemic has cost the country between $53 and $72 billion annually.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Purdue sits at the center of these events.  In the mid-1990s, it began marketing OxyContin, an opioid prescription pain reliever.  69 F.&nbsp;4th, at 56.  Because of the addictive quality of opioids, doctors had traditionally reserved their use for cancer patients and those “with chronic diseases.”  635 B.&nbsp;R.,<em> </em>at 42.  But OxyContin, Purdue claimed, had a novel “time-release” formula that greatly diminished the threat of addiction.  <em>Ibid</em>.  On that basis, Purdue marketed OxyContin for use in “&nbsp;‘a much broader range’&nbsp;” of applications, including as a “&nbsp;‘first-line therapy for the treatment of arthritis.’&nbsp;”  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Purdue was a “&nbsp;‘family company,’&nbsp;” owned and controlled by the Sacklers.  <em>Id</em>., at 40.  Members of the Sackler family served as president and chief executive officer; they dominated the board of directors; and they “were heavily involved” in the firm’s marketing strategies.  69 F.&nbsp;4th, at 86 (Wesley,&nbsp;J., concurring in judgment).  They “pushed sales targets,” too, and “accompanied sales representatives on ‘ride along’ visits to health care providers” in an effort to maximize OxyContin sales.  635 B.&nbsp;R., at 50.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Quickly, OxyContin became “&nbsp;‘the most prescribed brand-name narcotic medication’&nbsp;” in the United States.  <em>Id.</em>, at 43.  Between 1996 and 2019, “Purdue generated approximately $34 billion in revenue .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. , most of which came from OxyContin sales.”  <em>Id</em>., at 39.  The company’s success propelled &nbsp;the Sacklers onto lists “of the top twenty wealthiest families in America,” with an estimated net worth of $14 billion.  <em>Id</em>., at 40.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Eventually, however, the firm came under scrutiny.  In 2007, a Purdue affiliate pleaded guilty to a federal felony for misbranding OxyContin as “&nbsp;‘less addictive’&nbsp;” and “&nbsp;‘less subject to abuse .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. than other pain medications.’&nbsp;”  <em>Id</em>., at 48.  Thousands of civil lawsuits followed as individuals, families, and governments within and outside the United States sought damages from Purdue and the Sacklers for injuries allegedly caused by their deceptive marketing practices.  69 F.&nbsp;4th, at 60.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Appreciating this litigation “would eventually impact them directly,” <em>id.</em>, at 59, the Sacklers began what one family member described as a “&nbsp;‘milking’ program,” 635 B.&nbsp;R., at 57.  In the years before the 2007 plea agreement, Purdue’s distributions to the Sacklers represented less than 15% of its annual revenue.  <em>Ibid</em>.  After the plea agreement, the Sacklers began taking as much as 70% of the company’s revenue each year.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Between 2008 and 2016, the family’s distributions totaled approximately $11 billion, draining Purdue’s total assets by 75% and leaving it in “a significantly weakened financial” state.  69 F.&nbsp;4th, at 59.  The Sacklers diverted much of that money to overseas trusts and family-owned companies.  635 B.&nbsp;R., at 71.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> In 2019, Purdue filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  Members of the Sackler family saw in that development an opportunity “to get [their own] goals accomplished.”  <em>In re Purdue Pharma L.</em>&nbsp;<em>P.</em>, No. 19–23649 (Bkrtcy. Ct. SDNY, Aug. 18, 2021), ECF Doc. 3599, p.&nbsp;35 (testimony of David Sackler).  They proposed to return to Purdue’s bankruptcy estate $4.325 billion of the $11 billion they had withdrawn from the company in recent years.  69 F.&nbsp;4th, at 61.  But they offered to do so only through payments spread out over a &nbsp;decade.  <em>Id</em>., at 60.  And, in return, they sought the estate’s agreement on, and a judicial order addressing, two matters.  First, the Sacklers wanted to extinguish any claims the estate might have against family members, including for fraudulently transferring funds from Purdue in the years preceding its bankruptcy.  <em>In re Purdue Pharma L.</em>&nbsp;<em>P.</em>, 633 B.&nbsp;R. 53, 83–84 (Bkrtcy. Ct. SDNY 2021).  Second, the Sacklers wanted to end the growing number of lawsuits against them brought by opioid victims (the Sackler discharge).  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Sackler discharge they proposed comprised a release and an injunction.  The release sought to void not just current opioid-related claims against the family, but future ones as well.  It sought to ban not just claims by creditors participating in the bankruptcy proceeding, but claims by anyone who might otherwise sue Purdue.  It sought to extinguish not only claims for negligence, but also claims for fraud and willful misconduct.  1 App. 193.  And it proposed to end all these lawsuits without the consent of the opioid victims who brought them.  To enforce this release, the Sacklers sought an injunction “forever stay[ing], restrain[ing,] and enjoin[ing]” claims against them.  <em>Id.</em>, at 279.  That injunction would not just prevent suits against the company’s officers and directors but would run in favor of hundreds, if not thousands, of Sackler family members and entities under their control.<em>  Id</em>., at 117–190.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Purdue agreed to these terms and included them in the reorganization plan it presented to the bankruptcy court for approval.  In that plan, Purdue further proposed to reorganize as a “public benefit” company dedicated primarily to opioid education and abatement efforts.  633 B.&nbsp;R., at 74.  As for individual victims harmed by the company’s products, Purdue offered, with help from the Sacklers’ anticipated contribution, to provide payments from a base amount of $3,500 up to a ceiling of $48,000 (for the most dire cases, and all before deductions for attorney’s fees and &nbsp;other expenses).  See 1 App. 557–559, 573–585; 6 App. in No. 22–110 etc. (CA2), p.&nbsp;1697.  For those receiving more than the base amount, payments would come in installments spread over as many as 10 years.  7 <em>id.</em>, at 1805, 1812.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Creditors were polled on the proposed plan.  Though most who returned ballots supported it, fewer than 20% of eligible creditors participated.  21 <em>id.</em>, at 6253, 6258.  Thousands of opioid victims voted against the plan too, and many pleaded with the bankruptcy court not to wipe out their claims against the Sacklers without their consent.  635 B.&nbsp;R., at 35.  “Our system of justice,” they wrote, “demands that the allegations against the Sackler family be fully and fairly litigated in a public and open trial, that they be judged by an impartial jury, and that they be held accountable to those they have harmed.”  <em>In re Purdue Pharma L.</em>&nbsp;<em>P.</em>, No. 7:21–cv–07532 (SDNY, Oct. 25, 2021), ECF Doc. 94, p.&nbsp;21 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The U.&nbsp;S. Trustee, charged with promoting the integrity of the bankruptcy system for all stakeholders, joined in these objections.  So did eight States, the District of Columbia, the city of Seattle, and various Canadian municipalities and Tribes, each of which sought to pursue its own claims against the Sacklers.  635 B.&nbsp;R., at 35<em>.</em></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">C</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The bankruptcy court rejected the objectors’ arguments and entered an order confirming the plan, including its provisions related to the Sackler discharge.  633 B.&nbsp;R., at 95–115.  Soon, however, the district court vacated that decision.  Nothing in the law, that court held, authorized the bankruptcy court to extinguish claims against the Sacklers without the consent of the opioid victims who brought them.  635 B.&nbsp;R., at 115.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> After that setback, plan proponents, including Purdue, members of the Sackler family, and various creditors, ap&nbsp;pealed to the Second Circuit.  While their appeal was pending, they also floated a new proposal.  Now, they said, the Sacklers were willing to contribute an additional $1.175 to $1.675 billion to Purdue’s estate if the eight objecting States and the District of Columbia would withdraw their objections to the firm’s reorganization plan.  69 F.&nbsp;4th, at 67.  The Sacklers’ proposed contribution still fell well short of the $11 billion they received from the company between 2008 and 2016.  Nor did it begin to reflect the earnings the Sacklers have enjoyed from that sum over time.  And the proposed contribution would still come in installments spread over many years.  But the new proposal was enough to persuade the States and the District of Columbia to drop their objections to the plan, even as a number of individual victims, the Canadian creditors, and the U.&nbsp;S. Trustee persisted in theirs.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Ultimately, a divided panel of the Second Circuit reversed the district court and revived the bankruptcy court’s order approving the estate’s (now-modified) reorganization plan.  Writing separately, Judge Wesley acknowledged that a bankruptcy court enjoys broad authority to modify debtor-creditor relations.  But, he argued, nothing in the bankruptcy code grants a bankruptcy court the “extraordinary” power to release and enjoin claims against a third party without the consent of the affected claimants.  <em>Id</em>., at 89 (opinion concurring in judgment).  The majority’s contrary view, he added, “pin[ned the Second] Circuit firmly on one side of a weighty issue that, for too long, has split the courts of appeals.”  <em>Id</em>., at 90.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> After the Second Circuit ruled, the U.&nbsp;S. Trustee filed an application with this Court to stay its decision.  We granted the application and, treating it as a petition for a writ of certiorari, agreed to take this case to resolve the circuit split Judge Wesley highlighted.  600 U.&nbsp;S. ___ (2023).<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Gorsuch Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-1\" id=\"OPINION_4-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">&nbsp;II</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The plan proponents and U.&nbsp;S. Trustee agree on certain foundational points.  When a debtor files for bankruptcy, it “creates an estate” that includes virtually all the debtor’s assets.  <a aria-label=\"11 USC 541 a\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/541#a\">11 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §541(a)</a>.  Under Chapter 11, the debtor can work with its creditors to develop a reorganization plan governing the distribution of the estate’s assets; it must then present that plan to the bankruptcy court and win its approval.  §§1121, 1123, 1129, 1141.  Once the bankruptcy court issues an order confirming the plan, that document binds the debtor and its creditors going forward—even those who did not assent to the plan.  §1141(a).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Most relevant here, a bankruptcy court’s order confirming a plan “discharges the debtor from any debt that arose before the date of such confirmation,” except as provided in the plan, the confirmation order, or the code. §1141(d)(1)(A).  That discharge not only releases or “void[s] any past or future judgments on the” discharged debt; it also “operat[es] as an injunction .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. prohibit[ing] creditors from attempting to collect or to recover the debt.”  <em>Tennessee Student Assistance Corporation </em>v. <em>Hood</em>, <a aria-label=\"541 U. S. 440\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/541/440\">541 U.&nbsp;S. 440</a>, 447 (2004) (citing §§524(a)(1), (2)).  Generally, however, a discharge operates only for the benefit of the debtor against its creditors and “does not affect the liability of any other entity.”  §524(e).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Sacklers have not filed for bankruptcy and have not placed virtually all their assets on the table for distribution to creditors, yet they seek what essentially amounts to a &nbsp;discharge.  They hope to win a judicial order releasing pending claims against them brought by opioid victims.  They seek an injunction “permanently and forever” foreclosing similar suits in the future.  1 App. 279.  And they seek all this without the consent of those affected.  The question we face thus boils down to whether a court in bankruptcy may effectively extend to <em>nondebtors</em> the benefits of a Chapter 11 discharge usually reserved for <em>debtors</em>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">A</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> For an answer, we turn to §1123.  It addresses the “[c]ontents”—or terms—of the bankruptcy reorganization plan a debtor presents and a court approves in Chapter 11 proceedings.  Some plan terms are mandatory, §1123(a); others are optional, §1123(b).  No one suggests that anything like the Sackler discharge <em>must</em> be included in a debtor’s reorganization plan.  Instead, plan proponents contend, it is a provision a debtor <em>may</em> include and a court <em>may</em> approve in a reorganization plan.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Section 1123(b) governs that question.  It directs that a plan “may”:</p>\n<p class=\"bqbegin jy-both\"> “(1) impair or leave unimpaired any class of claims, secured or unsecured, or of interests;</p>\n<p class=\"bqpara jy-both\"> “(2) .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. provide for the assumption, rejection, or assignment of any executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor not previously rejected under [§365];</p>\n<p class=\"bqpara jy-both\"> “(3) provide for—</p>\n<p class=\"bqpara jy-both\"> “(A) the settlement or adjustment of any claim or interest belonging to the debtor or to the estate; or</p>\n<p class=\"bqpara jy-both\"> “(B) the retention and enforcement by the debtor, by the trustee, or by a representative of the estate appointed for such purpose, of any such claim or interest;</p>\n<p class=\"bqpara jy-both\"> “(4) provide for the sale of all or substantially all of the property of the estate, and the distribution of the proceeds of such sale among holders of claims or interests;</p>\n<p class=\"bqpara jy-both\">&nbsp; “(5) modify the rights of holders of secured claims, other than a claim secured only by a security interest in real property that is the debtor’s principal residence, or of holders of unsecured claims, or leave unaffected the rights of holders of any class of claims; and</p>\n<p class=\"bqend jy-both\"> “(6) include any other appropriate provision not inconsistent with the applicable provisions of this title.”</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> We can easily rule out the first five of these paragraphs as potential sources of legal authority for the Sackler discharge.  They permit a plan to address claims and property belonging to a debtor or its estate.  §§1123(b)(2), (3), (4).  They permit a plan to modify the rights of creditors who hold claims against the debtor or its estate.  §§1123(b)(1), (5).  But nothing in those paragraphs authorizes a plan to extinguish claims against third parties, like the Sacklers, without the consent of the affected claimants, like the opioid victims.  If authority for the Sackler discharge can be found anywhere, it must be found in paragraph (6).  That is the paragraph on which the Second Circuit primarily rested its decision below, and it is the one on which plan proponents pin their case here.<a aria-label=\"reference 2 of Gorsuch Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-2\" id=\"OPINION_4-2ref\"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> As the plan proponents see it, paragraph (6) allows a &nbsp;debtor to include in its plan, and a court to order, <em>any</em> term not “expressly forbid[den]” by the bankruptcy code as long as a bankruptcy judge deems it “appropriate” and consistent with the broad “purpose[s]” of bankruptcy.  69 F.&nbsp;4th, at 73–74; <em>post</em>, at 41–42 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Kavanaugh</span>,&nbsp;J., dissenting).  And because the code does not expressly forbid a nonconsensual nondebtor discharge, the reasoning goes, the bankruptcy court was free to authorize one here after finding it an “appropriate” provision.  See Brief for Sackler Family 19–21; Brief for Purdue 20; <em>post</em>, at 13–15.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This understanding of the statute faces an immediate obstacle.  Paragraph (6) is a catchall phrase tacked on at the end of a long and detailed list of specific directions.  When faced with a catchall phrase like that, courts do not necessarily afford it the broadest possible construction it can bear.  <em>Epic Systems Corp. </em>v. <em>Lewis</em>, <a aria-label=\"584 U. S. 497\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/584/497\">584 U.&nbsp;S. 497</a>, 512 (2018).  Instead, we generally appreciate that the catchall must be interpreted in light of its surrounding context and read to “embrace only objects similar in nature” to the specific examples preceding it.  <em>Ibid.</em> (internal quotation marks omitted).  So, for example, when a statute sets out a list discussing “cars, trucks, motorcycles, or any other vehicles,” we appreciate that the catchall phrase may reach similar landbound vehicles (perhaps including buses and camper vans), but it does not reach dissimilar “vehicles” (such as airplanes and submarines).  See <em>McBoyle </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"283 U. S. 25\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/283/25\">283 U.&nbsp;S. 25</a>, 26–27 (1931).  This ancient interpretive principle, sometimes called the <em>ejusdem generis</em> canon, seeks to afford a statute the scope a reasonable reader would attribute to it.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Viewed with that much in mind, we do not think paragraph (6) affords a bankruptcy court the authority the plan proponents suppose.  In some circumstances, it may be difficult to discern what a statute’s specific listed items share in common.  See A. Scalia &amp; B. Garner, Reading Law 207–&nbsp;208 (2012).  But here an obvious link exists:  When Congress authorized “appropriate” plan provisions in paragraph (6), it did so only after enumerating five specific sorts of provisions, all of which concern <em>the debtor</em>—its rights and responsibilities, and its relationship with its creditors.  Doubtless, paragraph (6) operates to confer additional authorities on a bankruptcy court.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Energy Resources Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"495 U. S. 545\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/495/545\">495 U.&nbsp;S. 545</a>, 549 (1990).  But the catchall cannot be fairly read to endow a bankruptcy court with the “radically different” power to discharge the debts of a nondebtor without the consent of affected nondebtor claimants.  <em>Epic Systems Corp.</em>, 584 U.&nbsp;S., at 513; see also <em>RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC</em> v. <em>Amalgamated Bank</em>, <a aria-label=\"566 U. S. 639\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/566/639\">566 U.&nbsp;S. 639</a>, 645–647 (2012).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The catchall’s text underscores the point.  Congress could have said in paragraph (6) that “everything not expressly prohibited is permitted.”  But it didn’t.  Instead, Congress set out a detailed list of powers, followed by a catchall that it qualified with the term “appropriate.”  That quintessentially “context dependent” term often draws its meaning from surrounding provisions.  <em>Sossamon</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a aria-label=\"563 U. S. 277\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/563/277\">563 U.&nbsp;S. 277</a>, 286 (2011).  And we know to look to the statute’s preceding specific paragraphs as the relevant “context” here because paragraph (6) tells us so.  It permits “any <em>other</em> appropriate provision”—that is, “other” than the provisions already discussed in paragraphs (1) through (5).  (Emphasis added.)  Each of those “other” paragraphs authorizes a bankruptcy court to adjust claims without consent only to the extent such claims concern the debtor.  From this, it follows naturally that an “appropriate provision” adopted pursuant to the catchall that purports to extinguish claims without consent should be similarly constrained.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Epic Systems Corp.</em>, 584 U.&nbsp;S., at 512–513.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> For its part, the dissent does not dispute that the <em>ejusdem generis </em>canon applies to §1123(b)(6).  <em>Post</em>, at 33–34; see also Brief for Sackler Family 44; Brief for Purdue 23.  But &nbsp;it disagrees with our application of the canon for two reasons.  First, the dissent claims, it “is factually incorrect” to suggest that all the provisions of §1123(b) concern the debtor’s rights and responsibilities.  <em>Post</em>, at 35.  The dissent points out that a bankruptcy estate may settle creditors’ “derivative claims” against nondebtors under paragraph (3).  <em>Post</em>, at 36<em>.</em>  And this “indisputable point,” the dissent declares, “defeats the Court’s conclusion that §1123(b)’s provisions relate only to the debtor and do not allow releases of claims that victims and creditors hold against nondebtors.”  <em>Post</em>, at 37; see Brief for Purdue 24–25.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> But that argument contains a glaring flaw.  The dissent neglects <em>why</em> a bankruptcy court may resolve derivate claims under paragraph (3):  It may because those<em> </em>claims<em> </em>belong to the debtor’s estate.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>In re Ontos, Inc.</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/478_F.3d_427\">478 F.&nbsp;3d 427</a>, 433 (CA1 2007).  In a derivative action, the named plaintiff “is only a nominal plaintiff.  The substantive claim belongs to the corporation.”  2 J. Macey, Corporation Laws §13.20[D], p.&nbsp;13–140 (2020–4 Supp.).  And no one questions that Purdue may address in its own bankruptcy plan claims “wherever located and by whomever held,” §541(a)—including those claims derivatively asserted by another on its behalf, see §1123(b)(3).  The problem is, the Sackler discharge is nothing like that.  Rather than seek to resolve claims that substantively belong to Purdue, it seeks to extinguish claims against the Sacklers that belong to their victims.  And precisely nothing in §1123(b) suggests those claims can be bargained away without the consent of those affected, as if the claims were somehow Purdue’s own property.<a aria-label=\"reference 3 of Gorsuch Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-3\" id=\"OPINION_4-3ref\"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; Having come up short on the text of §1123(b), the dissent pivots to the statute’s purpose.  <em>Post</em>, at 35.  As the dissent sees it, our application of the <em>ejusdem generis </em>canon should focus less on the provisions preceding the catchall and more on the overall “purpose of bankruptcy law” in solving “collective-action problem[s].”  <em>Post</em>, at 5, 35–36; see also Brief for Purdue 21.  But there is an obvious difficulty with this approach, too.  As this Court has long recognized, “[n]o statute pursues a single policy at all costs.”  <em>Bartenwerfer</em> v. <em>Buckley</em>, <a aria-label=\"598 U. S. 69\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/598/69\">598 U.&nbsp;S. 69</a>, 81 (2023).  Always, the question we face is <em>how far</em> Congress has gone in pursuing one policy or another.  See <em>ibid.  </em>So, yes, bankruptcy law may serve to address some collective-action problems, but no one (save perhaps the dissent) thinks it provides a bankruptcy court with a roving commission to resolve all such problems that happen its way, blind to the role other mechanisms (legislation, class actions, multi-district litigation, consensual settlements, among others) play in addressing them.  And here, the five paragraphs that precede the catchall tell us that bankruptcy courts may have many powers, including the power to address certain collective-action problems when they implicate the debtor’s rights and responsibilities.  But those directions also indicate that a bankruptcy court’s powers are not limitless and do not endow it with the power to extinguish without their consent claims held by nondebtors (here, the opioid victims) against other nondebtors (here, the Sacklers).<a aria-label=\"reference 4 of Gorsuch Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-4\" id=\"OPINION_4-4ref\"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">&nbsp;B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> When resolving a dispute about a statute’s meaning, we sometimes look for guidance not just in its immediate terms but in related provisions as well.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Turkiye Halk Bankasi A. S. </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"598 U. S. 264\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/598/264\">598 U.&nbsp;S. 264</a>, 275 (2023).  Paragraph (6) itself alludes to this fact by instructing that any plan term adopted under its auspices must not be “inconsistent with the applicable provisions of&nbsp;” the bankruptcy code.  Following that direction and looking to Chapter 11 more broadly, we find at least three further reasons why §1123(b)(6) cannot bear the interpretation the plan proponents and the dissent would have us give it.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> First, consider what is and who can earn a discharge.  As we have seen, a discharge releases the debtor from its debts and enjoins future efforts to collect them—even by those who do not assent to the debtor’s reorganization plan.  §§524(a)(1)–(2), 1129(b)(1), 1141(a).  Generally, too, the bankruptcy code reserves this benefit to “the debtor”—the entity that files for bankruptcy.  §1141(d)(1)(A); accord, §524(e); see also §§727(a)–(b).  The plan proponents and the dissent’s reading of §1123(b)(6) would defy these rules by effectively affording to a nondebtor a discharge usually reserved for the debtor alone.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Second, notice how the code constrains the debtor.  To win a discharge, again as we have seen, the code generally requires the debtor to come forward with virtually all its assets.  §§541(a)(1), 548.  Nor is the discharge a debtor receives unbounded.  It does not reach claims based on “fraud” or those alleging “willful and malicious injury.”  §§523(a)(2), (4), (6).  And it cannot “affect any right to trial by jury” a creditor may have “with regard to a personal injury or wrongful death tort claim.”  <a aria-label=\"28 USC 1411 a\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1411#a\">28&nbsp;U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §1411(a)</a>.  The plan proponents and the dissent’s reading of §1123(b)(6) transgresses all these limits too.  The Sacklers have not agreed to place anything approaching their full assets on the table for opioid victims.  Yet they seek a judicial order that would &nbsp;extinguish virtually all claims against them for fraud, willful injury, and even wrongful death, all without the consent of those who have brought and seek to bring such claims.  In each of these ways, the Sacklers seek to pay less than the code ordinarily requires and receive more than it normally permits.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Finally, there is a notable exception to the code’s general rules.  For asbestos-related bankruptcies—and only for such bankruptcies—Congress has provided that, “[n]otwithstanding” the usual rule that a debtor’s discharge does not affect the liabilities of others on that same debt, §524(e), courts may<em> </em>issue “an injunction .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. bar[ring] any action directed against a third party” under certain statutorily specified circumstances.  §524(g)(4)(A)(ii).  That the code <em>does</em> authorize courts to enjoin claims against third parties without their consent, but does so in only <em>one</em> context, makes it all the more unlikely that §1123(b)(6) is best read to afford courts that same authority in <em>every</em> context.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Bittner </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"598 U. S. 85\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/598/85\">598 U.&nbsp;S. 85</a>, 94 (2023); <em>AMG Capital Management, LLC </em>v.<em> FTC</em>, <a aria-label=\"593 U.

Essentially, they ask us to look the other way.  Whatever limits the code imposes on debtors and discharges mean nothing, they say, because the Sacklers seek a “release,” not a “discharge.”  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>post</em>, at 46–48.  But word &nbsp;games cannot obscure the underlying reality.  Once more, the Sacklers seek greater relief than a bankruptcy discharge normally affords, for they hope to extinguish even claims for wrongful death and fraud, and they seek to do so without putting anything close to all their assets on the table.  Nor is what the Sacklers seek a traditional release, for they hope to have a court extinguish claims of opioid victims without their consent.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, J. Macey, Corporate Governance:  Promises Kept, Promises Broken 152 (2008) (“settlements are, by definition, consensual”); accord, <em>Firefighters</em> v. <em>Cleveland</em>, <a aria-label=\"478 U. S. 501\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/478/501\">478 U.&nbsp;S. 501</a>, 529 (1986).  Describe the relief the Sacklers seek how you will, nothing in the bankruptcy code contemplates (much less authorizes) it.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">C</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> If text and context supply two strikes against the plan proponents and the dissent’s construction of §1123(b)(6), history offers a third.  When Congress enacted the present bankruptcy code in 1978, it did “not write ‘on a clean slate.’&nbsp;”  <em>Hall</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"566 U. S. 506\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/566/506\">566 U.&nbsp;S. 506</a>, 523 (2012) (quoting <em>Dewsnup </em>v. <em>Timm</em>, <a aria-label=\"502 U. S. 410\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/502/410\">502 U.&nbsp;S. 410</a>, 419 (1992)).  Recognizing as much, this Court has said that pre-code practice may sometimes inform our interpretation of the code’s more “ambiguous” provisions.  <em>RadLAX Gateway Hotel</em>, 566 U.&nbsp;S., at 649.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> While we discern no ambiguity in §1123(b)(6) for the reasons explored above, historical practice confirms the lesson we take from it.  Every bankruptcy law the parties and their <em>amici</em> have pointed us to, from 1800 until 1978, generally reserved the benefits of discharge to the debtor who offered a “fair and full surrender of [its] property.”  <em>Sturges</em> v. <em>Crowninshield</em>, 4 Wheat. 122, 176 (1819); accord, <em>Central Va. Community College</em> v. <em>Katz</em>, <a aria-label=\"546 U. S. 356\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/546/356\">546 U.&nbsp;S. 356</a>, 363–364 (2006); see, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., Bankruptcy Act of 1800, §5, <a href=\"/rio/citation/2_Stat._23\">2 Stat. 23</a> (repealed 1803); Act of Aug. 19, 1841, §3, <a href=\"/rio/citation/5_Stat._442\">5 Stat. 442</a>–443 (repealed 1843); Act of Mar. 2, 1867, §§11, 29, <a href=\"/rio/citation/14_Stat._521\">14 Stat. 521</a>, &nbsp;531–532 (repealed 1878); Bankruptcy Act of 1898, §§7, 14, <a href=\"/rio/citation/30_Stat._548\">30 Stat. 548</a>, 550 (repealed 1978).  No one has directed us to a statute or case suggesting American courts in the past enjoyed the power in bankruptcy to discharge claims brought by nondebtors against other nondebtors, all without the consent of those affected.  Surely, if Congress had meant to reshape traditional practice so profoundly in the present bankruptcy code, extending to courts the capacious new power the plan proponents claim, one might have expected it to say so expressly “somewhere in the [c]ode itself.”  <em>Dewsnup</em>, 502 U.&nbsp;S., at 420.<a aria-label=\"reference 6 of Gorsuch Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-6\" id=\"OPINION_4-6ref\"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">III</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Faced with so many marks against its interpretation of the law, plan proponents and the dissent resort to a policy argument.  The Sacklers, they remind us, have signaled that they will not return any funds to Purdue’s estate unless the bankruptcy court grants them the sweeping nonconsensual release and injunction they seek.  Absent these concessions, plan proponents and the dissent emphatically predict, “there will be no viable path” for victims to recover even $3,500 each.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 100; Brief for Sackler Family 27; see Brief for Respondent Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Purdue Pharma L.&nbsp;P. et&nbsp;al. 45–46; <em>post</em>, at 4, 21–28, 52–54.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The U.&nbsp;S. Trustee disputes that assessment.  Yes, he says, reversing the Second Circuit may cause Purdue’s current reorganization plan to unravel.  But that would also &nbsp;mean the Sacklers would face lawsuits by individual victims, States, other governmental entities, and perhaps even fraudulent-transfer claims from the bankruptcy estate.  So much legal exposure, the Trustee asserts, may induce the Sacklers to negotiate <em>consensual</em> releases on terms more favorable to opioid victims.  Brief for Petitioner 47–48.  The Sacklers may “want global peace,” the Trustee acknowledges, but that doesn’t “mea[n] that they wouldn’t pay a lot for 97.5 percent peace.”  Tr. of Oral Arg. 26.  After all, the Trustee reminds us, during the appeal in this very case, the Sacklers agreed to increase their contribution by more than $1 billion in order to secure the consent of the eight objecting States.  If past is prologue, the Trustee says, there may be a better deal on the horizon.<a aria-label=\"reference 7 of Gorsuch Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-7\" id=\"OPINION_4-7ref\"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Even putting that aside, the Trustee urges us to consider the ramifications of this case for others.  Nonconsensual third-party releases, he observes, allow tortfeasors to win immunity from the claims of their victims, including for claims (like wrongful death and fraud) they could not discharge in bankruptcy, and do so without placing anything approaching all of their assets on the table.  Endorsing that maneuver, the Trustee says, would provide a “roadmap for corporations and wealthy individuals to misuse the bankruptcy system” in future cases “to avoid mass-tort liability.”  Brief for Petitioner 44–45.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Both sides of this policy debate may have their points.  &nbsp;But, in the end, we are the wrong audience for them.  As the people’s elected representatives, Members of Congress enjoy the power, consistent with the Constitution, to make policy judgments about the proper scope of a bankruptcy discharge.  Someday, Congress may choose to add to the bankruptcy code special rules for opioid-related bankruptcies as it has for asbestos-related cases.  Or it may choose not to do so.  Either way, if a policy decision like that is to be made, it is for Congress to make.  Despite the misimpression left by today’s dissent, our only proper task is to interpret and apply the law as we find it; and nothing in present law authorizes the Sackler discharge.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">IV</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> As important as the question we decide today are ones we do not.  Nothing in what we have said should be construed to call into question <em>consensual</em> third-party releases offered in connection with a bankruptcy reorganization plan; those sorts of releases pose different questions and may rest on different legal grounds than the nonconsensual release at issue here.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>In</em>&nbsp;<em>re Specialty Equipment Cos.</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/3_F.3d_1043\">3 F.&nbsp;3d 1043</a>, 1047 (CA7 1993).  Nor do we have occasion today to express a view on what qualifies as a consensual release or pass upon a plan that provides for the full satisfaction of claims against a third-party nondebtor.  Additionally, because this case involves only a stayed reorganization plan, we do not address whether our reading of the bankruptcy code would justify unwinding reorganization plans that have already become effective and been substantially consummated.  Confining ourselves to the question presented, we hold only that the bankruptcy code does not authorize a release and injunction that, as part of a plan of reorganization under Chapter 11, effectively seeks to discharge claims against a nondebtor without the consent of affected claimants.  Because the Second Circuit ruled otherwise, its judg&nbsp;ment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"></p>\n<p class=\"flushrgtpara jy-right\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<h3 class=\"fnheader\">Notes</h3>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-1\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Gorsuch Opinion at reference 1\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-1ref\">1</a> &nbsp;For examples of decisions on both sides of the split, compare <em>In re Pacific Lumber Co.</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/584_F.3d_229\">584 F.&nbsp;3d 229</a> (CA5 2009); <em>In re Lowenschuss</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/67_F.3d_1394\">67 F.&nbsp;3d 1394</a> (CA9 1995); <em>In</em>&nbsp;<em>re Western Real Estate Fund, Inc.</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/922_F.2d_592\">922 F.&nbsp;2d 592</a> (CA10 1990), with <em>In</em>&nbsp;<em>re Millennium Lab Holdings II, LLC</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/945_F.3d_126\">945 F.&nbsp;3d 126</a> (CA3 2019); <em>In</em>&nbsp;<em>re Seaside Engineering &amp; Surveying, Inc.</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/780_F.3d_1070\">780 F.&nbsp;3d 1070</a> (CA11 2015); <em>In</em>&nbsp;<em>re Airadigm Communications, Inc.</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/519_F.3d_640\">519 F.&nbsp;3d 640</a> (CA7 2008); <em>In</em>&nbsp;<em>re Dow Corning Corp.</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/280_F.3d_648\">280 F.&nbsp;3d 648</a> (CA6 2002); <em>In</em>&nbsp;<em>re A.

See Brief for Mortimer-Side Initial Covered Respondents 19 (Brief for Sackler Family).  That provision allows a bankruptcy court to “issue any order, process, or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of&nbsp;” the bankruptcy code.  §105(a).  As the Second Circuit recognized, however, “§105(a) alone cannot justify” the imposition of nonconsensual third-party releases because it serves only to “&nbsp;‘carry out’&nbsp;” authorities expressly conferred elsewhere in the code.  69 F.&nbsp;4th 45, 73 (2023) (quoting §105(a)); see also 2 R.

But that does not alter the fact that the Sackler discharge would extinguish <em>the victim</em>s’ claims against <em>the</em> <em>Sacklers</em>.  Those claims neither belong to Purdue nor are they asserted against Purdue or its estate.  The dissent disregards these elemental distinctions.

The Court’s decision rewrites the text of the U. S. Bankruptcy Code and restricts the long-established authority of bankruptcy courts to fashion fair and equitable relief for mass-tort victims.  As a result, opioid victims are now deprived of the substantial monetary recovery that they long fought for and finally secured after years of litigation.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Bankruptcy seeks to solve a collective-action problem and prevent a race to the courthouse by individual creditors who, if successful, could obtain all of a company’s assets, leaving nothing for all the other creditors.  The bankruptcy system works to preserve a bankrupt company’s limited assets and to then fairly and equitably distribute those assets among the creditors—and in mass-tort bankruptcies, among the victims.  To do so, the Bankruptcy Code vests bankruptcy courts with broad discretion to approve “appropriate” plan provisions.  <a aria-label=\"11 USC 1123 b 6\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1123#b_6\">11 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §1123(b)(6)</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In this mass-tort bankruptcy case, the Bankruptcy Court exercised that discretion appropriately—indeed, admirably.  It approved a bankruptcy reorganization plan for Purdue Pharma that built up the estate to &nbsp;approximately $7 billion by securing a $5.5 to $6 billion settlement payment from the Sacklers, who were officers and directors of Purdue.  The plan then guaranteed substantial and equitable compensation to Purdue’s many victims and creditors, including more than 100,000 individual opioid victims.  The plan also provided significant funding for thousands of state and local governments to prevent and treat opioid addiction.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The plan was a shining example of the bankruptcy system at work.  Not surprisingly, therefore, virtually all of the opioid victims and creditors in this case fervently support approval of Purdue’s bankruptcy reorganization plan.  And all 50 state Attorneys General have signed on to the plan—a rare consensus.  The only relevant exceptions to the nearly universal desire for plan approval are a small group of Canadian creditors and one lone individual.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> But the Court now throws out the plan—and in doing so, categorically prohibits non-debtor releases, which have long been a critical tool for bankruptcy courts to manage mass-tort bankruptcies like this one.  The Court’s decision finds no mooring in the Bankruptcy Code.  Under the Code, all agree that a bankruptcy plan can nonconsensually release victims’ and creditors’ claims <em>against a bankrupt company</em>—here, against Purdue.  Yet the Court today says that a plan can <em>never</em> release victims’ and creditors’ claims <em>against non-debtor officers and directors of the company</em>—here, against the Sacklers.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> That is true, the Court says, even when (as here) those non-debtor releases are necessary to facilitate a fair settlement with the officers and directors and produce a significantly larger bankruptcy estate that can be fairly and equitably distributed among the victims and creditors.  And that is true, the Court also says, even when (as here) those officers and directors are indemnified by the company.  When officers and directors are indemnified by the company, a victim’s or creditor’s claim against the non-&nbsp;debtors “is, in essence, a suit against the debtor” that could “deplete the assets of the estate” for the benefit of only a few, just like a claim against the company itself.  <em>In&nbsp;re Purdue Pharma L.&nbsp;P.</em>, 69 F.&nbsp;4th 45, 78 (CA2 2023) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> It therefore makes little legal, practical, or economic sense to say, as the Court does, that the victims’ and creditors’ claims against the debtor can be released, but that it would be categorically “inappropriate” to release their identical claims against non-debtors even when they are indemnified or when the release generates a significant settlement payment by the non-debtor to the estate. </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> For decades, bankruptcy courts and courts of appeals have determined that non-debtor releases can be appropriate and essential in mass-tort cases like this one.  Non-debtor releases have enabled substantial and equitable relief to victims in cases ranging from asbestos, Dalkon Shield, and Dow Corning silicone breast implants to the Catholic Church and the Boy Scouts.  As leading scholars on bankruptcy explain, “the bankruptcy community has recognized the resolution of mass tort claims as a widely accepted core function of bankruptcy courts for decades”—and they emphasize that a “key feature in every mass tort bankruptcy” has been the non-debtor release.  A. Casey &amp; J. Macey, In Defense of Chapter 11 for Mass Torts, 90 U.&nbsp;Chi. L. Rev. 973, 974, 977 (2023).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> No longer.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Given the broad statutory text—“appropriate”—and the history of bankruptcy practice approving non-debtor releases in mass-tort bankruptcies, there is no good reason for the debilitating effects that the decision today imposes on the opioid victims in this case and on the bankruptcy system at large.  To be sure, many Americans have deep hostility toward the Sacklers.  But allowing that animosity to infect this bankruptcy case is entirely misdirected and counterproductive, and just piles even more injury onto the &nbsp;opioid victims.  And no one can have more hostility toward the Sacklers and a greater desire to go after the Sacklers’ assets than the opioid victims themselves.  Yet the victims unequivocally seek approval <em>of</em> <em>this plan</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> With the current plan now gone and non-debtor releases categorically prohibited, the consequences will be severe, as the victims and creditors forcefully explained.  Without releases, there will be no $5.5 to $6 billion settlement payment to the estate, and “there will be no viable path to any victim recovery.”  Tr. of Oral Arg. 100.  And without the plan’s substantial funding to prevent and treat opioid addiction, the victims and creditors bluntly described further repercussions: “more people will die without this Plan.”  Brief for Respondent Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Purdue Pharma L.&nbsp;P. et al. 55.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In short:  Despite the broad term “appropriate” in the statutory text, despite the longstanding precedents approving mass-tort bankruptcy plans with non-debtor releases like these, despite 50 state Attorneys General signing on, and despite the pleas of the opioid victims, today’s decision creates a new atextual restriction on the authority of bankruptcy courts to approve appropriate plan provisions.  The opioid victims and their families are deprived of their hard-won relief.  And the communities devastated by the opioid crisis are deprived of the funding needed to help prevent and treat opioid addiction.  As a result of the Court’s decision, each victim and creditor receives the essential equivalent of a lottery ticket for a possible future recovery for (at most) a few of them.  And as the Bankruptcy Court explained, without the non-debtor releases, there is no good reason to believe that any of the victims or state or local governments will ever recover anything.  I respectfully but emphatically dissent.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">&nbsp;I</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> To map out this dissent for the reader:  Part I (pages 5 to 18) discusses why non-debtor releases are often appropriate and essential, particularly in mass-tort bankruptcies.  Part II (pages 18 to 31) explains why non-debtor releases were appropriate and essential in the Purdue bankruptcy.  Part III (pages 31 to 52) engages the Court’s contrary arguments and why I respectfully disagree with those arguments.  Part IV (pages 52 to 54) sums up.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Throughout this opinion, keep in mind the goal of bankruptcy.  The bankruptcy system is designed to preserve the debtor’s estate so as to ensure fair and equitable recovery for creditors.  Bankruptcy courts achieve that overarching objective by, among other things, releasing claims that otherwise could deplete the estate for the benefit of only a few and leave all the other creditors with nothing.  And as courts have recognized for decades, especially in mass-tort cases, non-debtor releases are not merely “appropriate,” but can be absolutely critical to achieving the goal of bankruptcy—fair and equitable recovery for victims and creditors.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">A</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Article I, §8, of the Constitution affords Congress power to establish “uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States” and to “make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution” that power.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Early in the Nation’s history, Congress established the bankruptcy system.  In 1978, Congress significantly revamped and reenacted the Bankruptcy Code in its current form.  Bankruptcy Code of 1978, <a href=\"/rio/citation/92_Stat._2549\">92 Stat. 2549</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The purpose of bankruptcy law is to address the collective-action problem that a bankruptcy poses.  T.&nbsp;Jackson, The Logic and Limits of Bankruptcy Law 12–13 (1986).  When a company’s liabilities exceed its ability to &nbsp;pay creditors, every creditor has an incentive to maximize its own recovery before other creditors deplete the pot.  Without a mandatory collective system, the creditors would race to the courthouse to recover first.  One or a few successful creditors could then recover substantial funds, deplete the assets, and drive the company under—leaving other creditors with nothing.  See <em>id</em>., at 7–19; D. Baird, A World Without Bankruptcy, 50 Law &amp; Contemp. Prob. 173, 183–184 (1987); T. Jackson, Bankruptcy, Non-Bankruptcy Entitlements, and the Creditors’ Bargain, 91 Yale L.

One of the goals of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in particular is to fairly distribute estate assets among creditors “in order to prevent a race to the courthouse to dismember the debtor.”  7 Collier on Bankruptcy ¶1100.01, p. 1100–3 (R. Levin &amp; H. Sommer eds., 16th ed. 2023).  Chapter 11 is aimed at preserving an estate’s value for distribution to creditors in the face of that collective-action problem.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The basic Chapter 11 case runs as follows.  After the debtor files for bankruptcy under Chapter 11, the debtor’s property becomes property of the bankruptcy estate.  <a aria-label=\"11 USC 541\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/541\">11 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §541</a>.  Any litigation that might interfere with the property of the estate is subject to an automatic stay, thus preventing creditors from skipping the line by litigating in a separate forum against the debtor while the bankruptcy is ongoing.  §362.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> With litigation paused, the parties craft a plan of reorganization for the debtor.  The Code grants the bankruptcy court sweeping powers to reorganize the debtor company and ensure fair and equitable recovery for the creditors.  For example, the plan may authorize selling or retaining the company’s property; merging or consolidating &nbsp;the company; or amending the company’s charter.  §1123(a)(5).  The subsection at issue here, §1123(b), also authorizes many other kinds of provisions that bankruptcy plans may include.<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Kavanaugh Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-1\" id=\"DISSENT_5-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a>  Most relevant for this case, as I will explain, the reorganization plan may impair and release “any class of claims” that creditors hold against the debtor.  §1123(b)(1).  The plan may also settle and release “any claim or interest” that the debtor company holds against non-debtors.  §1123(b)(3).  And the plan may include “any other appropriate provision not inconsistent with the applicable provisions” of the Bankruptcy Code.  §1123(b)(6).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> To address any collective-action or holdout problem, the bankruptcy court has the power to approve a reorganization plan even without the consent of every creditor.  If creditors holding more than one-half in number (and at least two-thirds in amount) of the claims in every class accept the plan, the court can confirm the plan.  §§1126(c), 1129(a)(8)(A).  A plan is “said to be confirmed consensually &nbsp;if all classes of creditors vote in favor, even if some classes have dissenting creditors.”  7 Collier, Bankruptcy ¶1129.01, at&nbsp;1129–13.  That the bankruptcy system considers a plan with majority (even if not unanimous) support to be “consensual” underscores that the bankruptcy system is designed to benefit creditors collectively and prevent holdout problems.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Confirmation of the plan “generally discharges the debtor from all debts that arose before confirmation.”  <em>Id</em>., ¶1100.09[2][f], at&nbsp;1100–42 (citing §1141(d)).  And all creditors are bound by the plan’s distribution, even if some creditors are not happy and oppose the plan.  <em>Ibid</em>. </p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> This is a mass-tort bankruptcy case.  Mass-tort cases present the same collective-action problem that bankruptcy was designed to address.  “Without a mandatory rule that consolidates claims in a single tribunal, tort claimants would rationally enter a race to the courthouse.”  A. Casey &amp; J. Macey, In Defense of Chapter 11 for Mass Torts, 90 U.&nbsp;Chi. L. Rev. 973, 997 (2023).  And the “plaintiffs who bring successful suits earlier are likely to drain the firm’s resources, while inconsistent judgments could result in inequitable payouts even among plaintiffs who ultimately do collect.”  <em>Id</em>., at 994.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> For many decades now, bankruptcy law has stepped in as a coordinating tribunal in significant mass-tort cases.  When a company that is liable for mass torts files for bankruptcy, the bankruptcy system enables (and requires) the mass-tort victims who are seeking relief from the bankrupt company to work together to reach a fair and equitable distribution of the company’s assets.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In many cases, there is no workable alternative other than bankruptcy for achieving fair and equitable recovery for mass-tort victims.  “Outside of bankruptcy,” victims face “significant administrative costs” of multi-district &nbsp;litigation, “which has limited coordination mechanisms and no tools for binding future claimants.”  <em>Id</em>., at 1005.  And multi-district litigation cannot “solve the collective action problem because dissenting claimants can opt out of settlements even when super majorities favor them.”  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Bankruptcy, on the other hand, reduces administrative costs and allows all of the affected parties to come together, pause litigation elsewhere, invoke procedural safeguards including discovery, and reach a collective resolution that considers both current and future victims.  Cf. Federal Judicial Center, E.&nbsp;Gibson, Case Studies of Mass Tort Limited Fund Class Action Settlements &amp; Bankruptcy Reorganizations 6 (2000) (“bankruptcy reorganizations provide an inherently fairer method of resolving mass tort claims” than alternative of class-action settlements).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In some cases—including mass-tort cases—it is not only the debtor company, but rather another closely related person or entity such as officers and directors (non-debtors), who may hold valuable assets and also be potentially liable for the company’s wrongdoing.  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> But it may be uncertain whether the victims can recover in tort suits against the non-debtors due to legal hurdles or difficulty reaching the non-debtors’ assets.   In those cases, a settlement may be reached:  In exchange for being released from potential liability for any wrongdoing, the non-debtor must make substantial payments to the company’s bankruptcy estate in order to compensate victims.  As long as the settlement is fair, the non-debtor’s settlement payment will benefit victims “by enlarging the pie of recoverable funds” in the bankruptcy estate.  Casey &amp; Macey, 90 U. Chi. L.&nbsp;Rev., at 1001.  And it will reduce administrative costs, because the victims’ claims against both the debtor and the non-debtor may be resolved “at the same time and in the same tribunal.”  <em>Id</em>., at 1002.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The non-debtor’s settlement payment into the estate can also solve a collective-action problem.  Bringing the non-&nbsp;debtor’s assets into the bankruptcy estate enables those assets to be distributed fairly and equitably among victims, rather than swallowed up by the first victim to successfully sue the non-debtor.  <em>Id</em>., at 1002–1003.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> A separate collective-action problem can arise when the insolvent company’s officers and directors are indemnified by the company for liability arising out of their job duties.  In such cases, “a suit against the non-debtor is, in essence, a suit against the debtor.”  <em>In&nbsp;re Purdue Pharma L.&nbsp;P.</em>, 69 F.&nbsp;4th 45, 78 (CA2 2023) (quotation marks omitted).  If not barred from doing so, the creditors could race to the courthouse against the indemnified officers and directors for basically the same claims that they hold against the debtor company.  If successful, such suits would deplete the company’s assets because a judgment against the indemnified officers and directors would likely come out of the debtor company’s assets.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Another similar collective-action problem can involve liability insurance, a kind of indemnification relationship where the insurer is on the hook for tort victims’ claims against the debtor company.  See B. Zaretsky, Insurance Proceeds in Bankruptcy, 55 Brooklyn L. Rev. 373, 375–376 (1989).  The insurance assets—meaning assets to the limits of the debtor’s insurance coverage—are usually a key asset for the bankruptcy estate to compensate victims.  But tort victims also “may have direct action rights against the insurance carrier, even, in some cases, bypassing the debtor-insured.”  5 Collier, Bankruptcy ¶541.10[3], at&nbsp;541–60.  If victims brought their claims directly against the insurer for the same claims that they hold against the estate, one group of victims could obtain from the insurer the full amount of the debtor’s coverage.  That would obviously prevent the insurance money from being used as part of the bankruptcy estate.  See Zaretsky, 55 Brooklyn L.&nbsp;Rev., at 376–377, 394–395.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; To address those various collective-action problems, bankruptcy courts have long found non-debtor releases to be appropriate in certain complex bankruptcy cases, especially in mass-tort bankruptcies.  Indeed, that is precisely why non-debtor releases emerged in asbestos mass-tort bankruptcies in the 1980s.  See <em>id</em>., at 405–414; Casey &amp; Macey, 90 U.&nbsp;Chi. L. Rev., at 998–999; see, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>MacArthur Co. </em>v. <em>Johns-Manville Corp.</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/837_F.2d_89\">837 F.&nbsp;2d 89</a> (CA2 1988).  And that is precisely why non-debtor releases have become such a well-established tool in mass-tort bankruptcies in the decades since.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> For example, after A.&nbsp;H. Robins declared bankruptcy in 1985 in the face of massive tort liability for injuries from its defective intrauterine device, the Dalkon Shield, nearly 200,000 victims filed proof of claims.  <em>In&nbsp;re A.&nbsp;H. Robins Co.</em>, 88 B.&nbsp;R. 742, 743–744, 747 (ED Va. 1988), aff&nbsp;’d, <a href=\"/rio/citation/880_F.2d_694\">880 F.&nbsp;2d 694</a> (CA4 1989).  A plan provision releasing the company’s directors and insurance company ensured that the estate would not be depleted through indemnity or contribution claims, or claims brought directly against the directors or insurer.  88 B.&nbsp;R., at 751; <a aria-label=\"880 F.2d 700\" href=\"/rio/citation/880_F.2d_700\">880 F.&nbsp;2d, at 700</a>–702.  Preventing the victims from engaging in “piecemeal litigation” against the non-debtor directors and insurance company was the only way to ensure “equality of treatment of similarly situated creditors.”  88 B.&nbsp;R., at 751.  Therefore, the Bankruptcy Court found (and the Fourth Circuit agreed) that the release was “necessary and essential” to the bankruptcy’s success.  <em>Ibid</em>.; see <a aria-label=\"880 F.2d 701\" href=\"/rio/citation/880_F.2d_701\">880 F.&nbsp;2d, at 701</a>–702.  The plan ultimately provided for the victims to recover in full, and they overwhelmingly approved the plan.  <em>Id</em>., at 700–701.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> A non-debtor release provision was similarly essential to resolve hundreds of thousands of victims’ tort claims against Dow Corning Corporation, which declared bankruptcy in 1995 in the face of liability for its defective silicone breast implants.  See <em>In&nbsp;re Dow Corning Corp.</em>, 287 &nbsp;B.&nbsp;R. 396, 397 (ED Mich. 2002).  The non-debtor release provision prevented the victims from suing Dow Corning’s insurers and shareholders for their tort claims—which would have depleted Dow Corning’s shared insurance assets and other estate assets.  <em>Id</em>., at 402–403, 406–408.  The non-debtor release provision was “essential” to the bankruptcy reorganization because the reorganization hinged “on the debtor being free from indirect suits against parties who would have indemnity or contribution claims against the debtor.”  <em>In re Dow Corning Corp</em>., <a href=\"/rio/citation/280_F.3d_648\">280 F.&nbsp;3d 648</a>, 658 (CA6 2002); 287 B.&nbsp;R., at 410–413.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The need for such a tool to deal with complex bankruptcy cases has not gone away.  Far from it.  Indeed, without the option of bankruptcy with non-debtor releases, “tort victims in several recent high-profile cases would have received less compensation; the compensation would have been unfairly distributed; and the administrative costs of resolving their claims would have been higher.”  Casey &amp; Macey, 90 U. Chi. L.&nbsp;Rev., at 979; see also Brief for Law Professors in Support of Respondents as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 21–25; Brief for Certain Former Commissioners of the American Bankruptcy Institute’s Commission To Study the Reform of Chapter 11 as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 9–11; Brief for Association of the Bar of the City of New York as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 9, 11–15.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Consider two recent examples that ensured recovery for the victims of torts committed by the Boy Scouts of America and by several dioceses of the Catholic Church.  In both cases, a national or regional organization was the debtor in the bankruptcy.  But that organization shared its liability and its insurance policy with numerous other legally separate and autonomous local entities.  Without a coordinating mechanism, a victim’s (or group of victims’) recovery against one local entity could have eaten up all of the shared insurance assets, leaving all of the other victims with nothing.  Brief for Boy Scouts of America as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>9–14, 17–19; Brief for U. S. Conference of Catholic Bishops as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>9–22.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Bankruptcy provided a forum to coordinate liability and insurance assets.  A non-debtor release provision prevented victims from litigating outside of the bankruptcy plan’s procedures.  And the provision therefore prevented one victim or group of victims from obtaining all of the insurance funds before other victims recovered.  As a result, in each case, the local entities were able to pool their resources to create a substantial fund in a single bankruptcy estate to compensate victims substantially and fairly.  Brief for Boy Scouts of America as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>11–12, 20–21; Brief for Ad&nbsp;Hoc Group of Local Councils of the Boy Scouts of America as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 5–6; Brief for U.&nbsp;S. Conference of Catholic Bishops as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 15–16.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> As those examples show, in some cases where various closely related but distinct parties share liability or share assets (or both), bankruptcy “provides the <em>only </em>forum in the U.&nbsp;S. legal system where a unified and complete resolution of mass-tort cases can reliably occur in a manner that results in a fair recovery and distribution for all claimants.”  Brief for Association of the Bar of the City of New York as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 15.  And the bankruptcy system could not do so without non-debtor releases.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">C</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The Bankruptcy Code gives bankruptcy courts authority to approve non-debtor releases to solve the complex collective-action problems that such cases present.  As noted above, a Chapter 11 reorganization plan may release creditor claims against debtors.  §1123(b)(1).  And a plan may settle and release debtor claims against non-debtors.  §1123(b)(3).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In addition, the plan may also include “any other appropriate provision not inconsistent with the applicable &nbsp;provisions of&nbsp;” the Code.  §1123(b)(6).  Section 1123(b)(6) provides ample flexibility for the reorganization plan to settle and release creditor claims against non-debtors who are closely related to the debtor.  For example, officers and directors may be indemnified by the debtor company; in those cases, creditor claims against indemnified non-debtors are essentially the same as creditor claims against the debtor business itself.  Or the non-debtors may reach a settlement with the victims and creditors where the non-debtors pay a settlement amount to the estate, which in some cases may be the only way to ensure fair and equitable recovery for the victims and creditors.  The non-debtor releases—just like debtor releases under §1123(b)(1) and non-debtor releases under §1123(b)(3)—can be essential to preserve and increase the estate’s assets and can be essential to ensure fair and equitable victim and creditor recovery.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The key statutory term in §1123(b)(6) is “appropriate.”  As this Court has often said, “appropriate” is a “broad and all-encompassing term that naturally and traditionally includes consideration of all the relevant factors.”  <em>Michigan</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, <a aria-label=\"576 U. S. 743\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/576/743\">576 U.&nbsp;S. 743</a>, 752 (2015) (quotation marks omitted).  Because determining propriety requires exercising judgment, the inquiry must include a degree of “flexibility.”  <em>Ibid</em>.  The Court has explained on numerous occasions that the “ordinary meaning” of a statute authorizing appropriate relief “confers broad discretion” on a court.  <em>School Comm. of Burlington</em> v. <em>Department of Ed. of Mass</em>., <a aria-label=\"471 U. S. 359\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/471/359\">471 U.&nbsp;S. 359</a>, 369 (1985); see also, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Sheet Metal Workers</em> v. <em>EEOC</em>, <a aria-label=\"478 U. S. 421\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/478/421\">478 U.&nbsp;S. 421</a>, 446 (1986) (plurality opinion) (Title VII “vest[s] district courts with broad discretion to award ‘appropriate’ equitable relief&nbsp;”); <em>Cooter &amp; Gell</em> v. <em>Hartmarx Corp</em>., <a aria-label=\"496 U. S. 384\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/496/384\">496 U.&nbsp;S. 384</a>, 400 (1990) (“In directing the district court to impose an ‘appropriate’ sanction, Rule 11 itself indicates that the district court is empowered to exercise its discretion”).  Because the &nbsp;“language is open-ended on its face,” whether a provision is “appropriate is inherently context dependent.”  <em>Tanzin</em> v. <em>Tanvir</em>, <a aria-label=\"592 U. S. 43\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/592/43\">592 U.&nbsp;S. 43</a>, 49 (2020) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> By allowing “any other appropriate provision,” §1123(b)(6) empowers a bankruptcy court to exercise reasonable discretion.  That §1123 confers broad discretion makes eminent sense, given “the policies of flexibility and equity built into Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.”  <em>NLRB</em> v. <em>Bildisco &amp; Bildisco</em>, <a aria-label=\"465 U. S. 513\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/465/513\">465 U.&nbsp;S. 513</a>, 525 (1984).  Such flexibility is important to achieve Chapter 11’s ever-elusive goal of ensuring fair and equitable recovery to creditors.  See §§1129(a)(7), (b)(1).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The catchall authority in Chapter 11 therefore empowers a bankruptcy court to exercise its discretion to deal with complex scenarios, like the collective-action problems that plague mass-tort bankruptcies.  Non-debtor releases are often appropriate—indeed are essential—in such circumstances.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> And courts have therefore long found non-debtor releases to be appropriate in certain narrow circumstances under §1123(b)(6).  Indeed, courts have been approving such non-debtor releases almost as long as the current Bankruptcy Code has existed since its enactment in 1978.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>In&nbsp;re Johns-Manville Corp</em>., 68 B.&nbsp;R. 618, 624–626 (Bkrtcy. Ct. SDNY 1986), aff&nbsp;’d, <a aria-label=\"837 F.2d 90\" href=\"/rio/citation/837_F.2d_90\">837 F.&nbsp;2d, at 90</a>; <em>A.&nbsp;H. Robins Co.</em>, 88 B.&nbsp;R., at 751, aff&nbsp;’d, <a aria-label=\"880 F.2d 696\" href=\"/rio/citation/880_F.2d_696\">880 F.&nbsp;2d, at 696</a>.  Historical and contemporary practice demonstrate that non-debtor releases are especially appropriate when (as here) non-debtor releases and corresponding settlement payments preserve and increase the debtor’s estate and thereby ensure fair and equitable recovery for creditors.   </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Over those decades of practice, courts have developed and applied numerous factors for determining whether a non-debtor release is “appropriate” in a given case.  §1123(b)(6); see H. Friendly, Indiscretion About Discretion, 31 Emory L.&nbsp;J. 747, 771–773 (1982) (noting the common-law-like &nbsp;process by which factors important to a discretionary decision develop over time).  Those factors reflect the fact that determining whether a non-debtor release is “appropriate” is a holistic inquiry that depends on the precise facts and circumstances of each case.  And the factors have served to confine the use of non-debtor releases to well-defined and narrow circumstances—precisely those circumstances where the collective-action problems arise.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> For instance, since the 1980s, the Second Circuit has been a leader on the non-debtor release issue.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Johns-Manville Corp.</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/837_F.2d_89\">837 F.&nbsp;2d 89</a> (1988); <em>In&nbsp;re Drexel Burnham Lambert Group, Inc.</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/960_F.2d_285\">960 F.&nbsp;2d 285</a> (1992); <em>In&nbsp;re Metromedia Fiber Network, Inc.</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/416_F.3d_136\">416 F.&nbsp;3d 136</a> (2005).  Over time, the Second Circuit has developed a non-exhaustive list of factors for determining whether a non-debtor release is appropriately employed and appropriately tailored in a given case.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> First, and critically, the court must determine whether the released party is closely related to the debtor—for example, through an indemnification agreement—where “a suit against the non-debtor is, in essence, a suit against the debtor or will deplete the assets of the estate.”  69 F.&nbsp;4th, at 78 (quotation marks omitted).  Second, the court must determine if the claims against the non-debtor are “factually and legally intertwined” with claims against the debtor.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Third, the court must ensure that the “scope of the releases” is tailored to only the claims that must be released to protect the plan.  <em>Ibid.  </em>Fourth, even then, the court should approve the release only if it is truly “essential” to the plan’s success and the reorganization would fail without it.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Fifth, the court must consider whether, as part of the settlement, the non-debtor party has paid “substantial assets” to the estate.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Sixth, the court should determine if the plan provides “fair payment” to creditors for their released claims.  <em>Id</em>., at 79.  Seventh, the court must ensure that the creditors “overwhelmingly” &nbsp;approve of the release, which the Second Circuit defined as a 75 percent “bare minimum.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 78–79 (quotation marks omitted).<a aria-label=\"reference 2 of Kavanaugh Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-2\" id=\"DISSENT_5-2ref\"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Factors one through four ensure that the releases are necessary to solve collective-action problems that threaten the bankruptcy and prevent fair and equitable recovery for the victims and creditors.  Factor five makes sure that the releases are not a free ride for the non-debtor.  Factor six ensures that the victims and creditors receive fair compensation.  Together, factors five and six assess whether there has been a fair settlement given the probability of victims’ and creditors’ recovery from the non-debtor and the likely amount of any such recovery.  And factor seven ensures that the vast majority of victims and creditors approve, meaning that the release is solving a holdout problem.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> As the Courts of Appeals’ comprehensive factors illustrate, §1123(b)(6) limits a bankruptcy court’s authority in important respects.  A non-debtor release must be “appropriate” given all of the facts and circumstances of the case.  And as the history of non-debtor releases illustrates, the appropriateness requirement confines the use of non-debtor releases to narrow and relatively rare circumstances where the releases are necessary to help victims and creditors achieve fair and equitable recovery.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> As long as every class of victims and creditors supports the plan by a majority vote in number and at least a two-thirds vote in amount, the plan is “said to be confirmed consensually,” “even if some classes have dissenting creditors.”  7 Collier, Bankruptcy ¶1129.01, at 1129–13.  And the Courts of Appeals have allowed non-debtor &nbsp;releases only when there is an even higher level of supermajority victim and creditor approval.  In the mass-tort bankruptcy cases, most plans have easily cleared that bar and received close to 100 percent approval. <em> E.g.</em>, <em>Johns-Manville Corp.</em>, 68 B.&nbsp;R., at 631 (95 percent approval); <em>A.&nbsp;H. Robins Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"880 F.2d 700\" href=\"/rio/citation/880_F.2d_700\">880 F.&nbsp;2d, at 700</a> (over 94 percent approval); <em>Dow Corning</em>, 287 B.&nbsp;R., at 413 (over 94 percent approval); 69 F. 4th, at 82 (over 95 percent approval here).  So in reality, as opposed to rhetoric, the non-debtor releases in mass-tort bankruptcy plans, including this one, have been approved by all but a comparatively small group of victims and creditors.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In every bankruptcy of this kind, moreover, the plan nonconsensually releases victims’ and creditors’ claims <em>against the debtor</em>.  The only difference with non-debtor releases is that they release victims’ and creditors’ claims not against the debtor but rather against non-debtors who are closely related to the debtor, such as indemnified officers and directors.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">II</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> In this case, as in many past mass-tort bankruptcies, the non-debtor releases were appropriate and therefore authorized by <a aria-label=\"11 USC 1123 b 6\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1123#b_6\">11 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §1123(b)(6)</a> of the Code.  The non-debtor releases were needed to ensure meaningful victim and creditor recovery in the face of multiple collective-action problems.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">A</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Purdue Pharma was a pharmaceutical company owned and directed by the extended Sackler family.  Brothers Arthur, Mortimer, and Raymond Sackler purchased the company in 1952.  Since then, Purdue has been wholly owned by entities and trusts established for the benefit of Mortimer Sackler’s and Raymond Sackler’s families and &nbsp;descendants, and those families also closely controlled Purdue’s operations.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In the 1990s, Purdue developed the drug OxyContin, a powerful and addictive opioid painkiller.  Purdue aggressively marketed that drug and downplayed or hid its addictive qualities.  OxyContin helped people to manage pain.  But the drug’s addictive qualities led to its widespread abuse.  OxyContin played a central role in the opioid-abuse crisis from which millions of Americans and their families continue to suffer.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Starting in the early 2000s, governments and individual plaintiffs began to sue Purdue for the harm caused by OxyContin.  In 2007, Purdue settled large swaths of those claims and pled guilty to felony misbranding of OxyContin.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> But within the next decade, victims of the opioid crisis and their families, along with state and local governments fighting the crisis, began filing a new wave of lawsuits, this time also naming members of the Sackler family as defendants.  Today, those claims amount to more than $40 <em>trillion</em> worth of alleged damages against Purdue and the Sacklers.  (For perspective, $40 trillion is about seven times the total annual spending of the U. S. Government.)</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> As the litigation by victims and state and local governments mounted, the U. S. Government then brought federal criminal and civil charges against Purdue.  The U.&nbsp;S. Government has not brought criminal charges against any of the Sacklers individually.  Nor have any States brought criminal charges against any of the Sacklers individually.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> As to the criminal charges against Purdue, the company pled guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United States, to violate the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and to violate the federal anti-kickback statute.  As part of the global resolution of the charges, Purdue agreed to a $2 billion judgment to the U. S. Government that would be “deemed to have the status of an allowed superpriority” claim in &nbsp;bankruptcy.  17 App. in No. 22–110 etc. (CA2), p.&nbsp;4804.  The U.&nbsp;S. Government agreed not to “initiate any further criminal charges against Purdue.”  16 <em>id.,</em> at 4798.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Unable to pay its colossal potential liabilities, Purdue filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.  The ensuing case exemplified the flexibility and common sense of the bankruptcy system at work.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The proceedings were extraordinarily complex.  The case involved “likely the largest creditor body ever,” and the number of claims filed—totaling more than 600,000—was likely “a record.”  <em>In&nbsp;re Purdue Pharma L.&nbsp;P.</em>, 633 B.&nbsp;R. 53, 58 (Bkrtcy. Ct. SDNY 2021).  Further complicating matters was the need to allocate funds between, on the one hand, individual victims and the hospitals that urgently needed relief and, on the other hand, government entities at all levels that urgently needed funds for opioid crisis prevention and treatment efforts.  <em>Id</em>., at 83.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Aided by perhaps “the most extensive discovery process” that “any court in bankruptcy has ever seen,” the parties engaged in prolonged arms-length negotiations.  <em>Id</em>., at 85–86.  They ultimately agreed on a multi-faceted compensation plan for the victims and creditors and reorganization plan for Purdue.  Under that plan, Purdue would cease to exist and would be replaced with a new company that would manufacture opioid-abatement medications.  And approximately $7 billion would be distributed among nine trusts to compensate victims and creditors and to fund efforts to abate the opioid crisis by preventing and treating addiction.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> To determine how to allocate the $7 billion, the victims and creditors then engaged in a series of “heavily negotiated and intricately woven compromises” and devised a “complex allocation” of the funds to different classes of victims and creditors.  <em>Id</em>., at 83, 90.  In the end, more than 95 percent of voting victims and creditors approved of the distribution scheme.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; That plan would distribute billions of dollars to communities to use exclusively for prevention and treatment programs.  And $700 to $750 million was set aside to compensate individual tort victims and their families.  1&nbsp;App. 561.  Opioid victims and their families would each receive somewhere between $3,500 and $48,000 depending on the category of claim and level of harm.  <em>Id</em>., at 573–584; 6 App. in No. 22–110 etc. (CA2), at 1695.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Under the reorganization plan, victims’ and creditors’ claims <em>against Purdue Pharma</em> were released (even if some victims and creditors did not consent).  As in other mass-tort bankruptcies described above, a related and equally essential facet of the Purdue plan was the non-debtor release provision.  Under that provision, the victims’ and creditors’ claims <em>against the Sacklers</em> were also released.  As a result, Purdue’s victims and creditors could not later sue either Purdue Pharma or members of the Sackler family (the officers and directors of Purdue Pharma) for Purdue’s and the Sacklers’ opioid-related activities.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The non-debtor release provision prevented a race to the courthouse against the Sacklers.  As a result, the non-debtor release provision solved two separate collective-action problems that dogged Purdue’s mass-tort bankruptcy:  (i)&nbsp;It protected Purdue’s estate from the risk of being depleted by indemnification claims, and (ii)&nbsp;it operated as a settlement of potential claims against the Sacklers and thus enabled the Sacklers’ large settlement payment to the estate.  That settlement payment in turn quadrupled the amount in the Purdue estate and enabled substantially greater recovery for the victims.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> I will now explain both of those important points in some detail.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>First</em>, and critical to a proper understanding of this case, the non-debtor release provision was essential to <em>preserve</em> &nbsp;Purdue’s existing assets.  By preserving the estate, the non-debtor release provision ensured that the assets could be fairly and equitably apportioned among all victims and creditors rather than devoured by one group of potential plaintiffs.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> How?  Pursuant to a 2004 indemnification agreement, Purdue had agreed to pay for liability and legal expenses that officers and directors of Purdue faced for decisions related to Purdue, including opioid-related decisions.  See <em>In&nbsp;re Purdue Pharma L.&nbsp;P.</em>, 69 F.&nbsp;4th 45, 58–59 (CA2 2023).  That indemnification agreement covered judgments against the Sacklers and related legal expenses.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> As explained above, the Sacklers wholly owned and controlled Purdue, a closely held corporation.  The Sacklers “took a major role” in running Purdue, including making decisions about “Purdue’s practices regarding its opioid products.”  633 B.&nbsp;R., at 93.  In short, the Sacklers potentially shared much of the liability that Purdue faced for Purdue’s opioid practices.  See <em>In&nbsp;re Purdue Pharma, L.&nbsp;P.</em>, 635 B.&nbsp;R. 26, 87 (SDNY 2021) (claims against the Sacklers are “deeply connected with, if not entirely identical to,” claims against Purdue (quotation marks omitted)); see also 633 B.&nbsp;R., at 108.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> But due to the indemnification agreement, if victims and creditors were to sue the Sacklers directly for claims related to Purdue or opioids, the Sacklers would have a reasonable basis to seek reimbursement from Purdue for liability and litigation costs.  So Purdue could potentially be on the hook for a substantial amount of the Sacklers’ liability and litigation costs.  In such indemnification relationships, “a suit against the non-debtor is, in essence, a suit against the debtor or will deplete the assets of the estate.”  69 F.&nbsp;4th, at 78 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> As a real-world matter, therefore, opioid-related claims <em>against the Sacklers</em> could come out of the same pot of Purdue money as opioid-related claims <em>against Purdue</em>.  So &nbsp;releasing claims against the Sacklers is not meaningfully different from releasing claims against Purdue itself, which the bankruptcy plan here of course also mandated.  Both sets of releases were necessary to preserve Purdue’s estate so that it was available for all victims and creditors to recover fairly and equitably.  Otherwise, the estate could be zeroed out:  A few victims or creditors could race to the courthouse and obtain recovery from Purdue or the Sacklers (ultimately the same pot of money) and thereby deplete the assets of the company and leave nothing for everyone else.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> To fully understand why both sets of releases were necessary—against Purdue and against the Sacklers—suppose that the plan did <em>not</em> release the Sacklers from opioid- and Purdue-related liability.  Victims’ and creditors’ opioid-related claims <em>against Purdue</em> would be discharged in Purdue’s bankruptcy (even without their consent).  But any victims or creditors could still sue <em>the Sacklers</em> for essentially the same claims.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Suppose that a State or a group of victims sued the Sacklers and received a large reward.  The Sacklers “would have a reasonable basis to seek indemnification” from Purdue for judgments and legal expenses<em>.  Id.</em>, at 72.  Therefore, any liability judgments and litigation costs for certain plaintiffs in their suits <em>against the Sacklers</em> could “deplete the <em>res</em>” of <em>Purdue’s </em>bankruptcy—meaning that there might well be nothing left for all of the other victims and creditors.  <em>Id</em>., at 80.  Even if the Sacklers’ indemnification claims against Purdue were unsuccessful, Purdue would “be required to litigate” those claims, which would likely diminish the <em>res</em>, “no matter the ultimate outcome of those claims.”  <em>Ibid</em>.  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Every victim and creditor knows that a single judgment by someone else against the Sacklers could deplete the Purdue<em> </em>estate and leave nothing for anyone else.  So every victim and creditor would have an incentive to race to the &nbsp;courthouse to sue the Sacklers.  A classic collective-action problem.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The non-debtor releases of claims against the Sacklers prevented that collective-action problem in the same way that the releases of claims against Purdue itself prevented the identical collective-action problem.  Both protected Purdue’s assets from being consumed by the first to sue successfully.  And the non-debtor releases were narrowly tailored to the problem.  The non-debtor releases enjoined victims and creditors from bringing claims against the Sacklers only in cases where Purdue’s conduct, or the victims’ or creditors’ claims asserted against Purdue, was a legal cause or a legally relevant factor to the cause of action against the Sacklers.  633 B.&nbsp;R., at 97–98 (defining the release to encompass only claims that “directly affect the <em>res </em>of the Debtors’ estates,” such as claims that would trigger the Sacklers’ “rights to indemnification and contribution”); see also <em>id</em>., at 105.  In other words, the releases applied only to claims for which the Sacklers had a reasonable basis to seek coverage or reimbursement from Purdue.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The non-debtor release provision therefore released claims against the Sacklers that are essentially the same as claims against Purdue.  Doing so preserved Purdue’s bankruptcy estate so that it could be fairly apportioned among the victims and creditors.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Second</em>, the non-debtor releases not only <em>preserved</em> the existing Purdue estate; those non-debtor releases also greatly <em>increased </em>the funds in the Purdue estate so that the victims and creditors could receive greater compensation.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Standing alone, Purdue’s estate is estimated to be worth approximately $1.8 billion—a small fraction of the sizable claims against Purdue.  <em>Id</em>., at 90; 22 App. in No. 22–110 etc. (CA2), at&nbsp;6507.  If that were all the money on the table, the Bankruptcy Court found, the victims and creditors “would probably recover nothing” from Purdue’s estate.  633 &nbsp;B.&nbsp;R., at 109.  That is because the United States holds a $2 billion “superpriority” claim, meaning that the United States would be first in line to recover ahead of all of the victims and other creditors.  The United States’ claim would wipe out Purdue’s entire $1.8 billion value.  “As a result, many victims of the opioid crisis would go without any assistance.”  69 F.&nbsp;4th, at 80.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> So for the victims and other creditors to have any hope of meaningful recovery, Purdue’s bankruptcy estate needed more funds.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Where to find those funds?  The Sacklers’ assets were the answer.  After vigorous negotiations, a settlement was reached:  In exchange for the releases, the Sacklers ultimately agreed to make significant payments to Purdue’s estate—between $5.5 and $6 billion.  Adding that substantial amount to Purdue’s comparatively smaller bankruptcy estate enabled Purdue’s reorganization plan to distribute an estimated $7 billion or more to the victims and creditors—thereby quadrupling the size of the estate available for distribution.  With that enhanced estate, the plan garnered 95 percent support from the voting victims and creditors.  That high level of support tends to show that this was a very good plan for the victims and creditors.  Because it led to that high level of support, the Sacklers’ multi-billion-dollar payment was critical to creating a successful reorganization plan.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> That payment was made possible by heavily negotiated settlements among Purdue, the victims and creditors, and the Sacklers.  Most relevant here, in exchange for the Sacklers agreeing to pay billions of dollars to the bankruptcy estate, the victims and creditors agreed to release their claims against the Sacklers.  The settlement—exchanging releases for the Sacklers’ $5.5 to $6 billion payment—enabled the victims and creditors to avoid “the significant risk, cost and delay (potentially years) that &nbsp;would result from pursuing the Sacklers and related parties through litigation.”  1 App. 31.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Indeed, after a 6-day trial involving 41 witnesses, the Bankruptcy Court found that the settlement provided the best chance for the victims and creditors to ever see any money from the Sacklers.  See 633 B.&nbsp;R., at 85, 90.  (That is a critical point that the Court today whiffs on.)  Indeed, the Bankruptcy Court found that the victims and creditors would be unlikely to recover from the Sacklers by suing the Sacklers directly due to numerous potential weaknesses in and defenses to the victims’ and creditors’ legal theories.  See <em>id</em>., at 90–93, 108.  Even if the suits were successful, the Bankruptcy Court expressed “significant concern” about the ability to collect any judgments from the Sacklers due to the difficulty of reaching their assets in foreign countries and in spendthrift trusts.  <em>Id</em>., at 89; see also <em>id</em>., at 108–109.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> For those reasons, the Bankruptcy Court concluded that the $5.5 to $6 billion settlement payment and the releases were fair and equitable and in the victims’ and creditors’ best interest.  <em>Id</em>., at 107–109, 112.  The settlement amount of $5.5 to $6 billion was “properly negotiated” and “reflects the underlying strengths and weaknesses of the opposing parties’ legal positions and issues of collection.”  <em>Id</em>., at 93.<a aria-label=\"reference 3 of Kavanaugh Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-3\" id=\"DISSENT_5-3ref\"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> From the victims’ and creditors’ perspective, “suing the Sacklers would have been a costly endeavor with a small chance of success.  From the Sacklers’ perspective, defending those suits would have been a costly endeavor &nbsp;with a very small chance of a large liability.”  A. Casey &amp; J. Macey, In Defense of Chapter 11 for Mass Torts, 90 U.&nbsp;Chi. L. Rev. 973, 1004 (2023).  So as in many litigation settlements, the parties agreed to the $5.5 to $6 billion settlement in light of that “very small chance of a large liability.”  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Importantly, the victims and creditors—who obviously have no love for the Sacklers—insisted on the releases of their claims against the Sacklers.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 61, 93; Brief for Respondent Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Purdue Pharma L.&nbsp;P. et al. 10.  Why did the releases make sense for the victims and creditors?</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> For starters, the releases were part of the settlement and enabled the Sacklers’ $5.5 to $6 billion settlement payment.  Moreover, without the releases, some of Purdue’s victims and creditors—maybe a State, maybe some opioid victims—would sue the Sacklers directly for claims “deeply connected with, if not entirely identical to,” claims that the victims and creditors held against Purdue.  635 B.&nbsp;R., at 87 (quotation marks omitted).  To be sure, the Bankruptcy Court found that those suits would face significant challenges.  But the victims and creditors were understandably worried, as they explained during the Bankruptcy Court proceedings, that the Sacklers would “exhaust their collectible assets fighting and/or paying ONLY the claims of certain creditors with the best ability to pursue the Sacklers in court.”  1 App. 76.  And if even a <em>single</em> direct suit against the Sacklers succeeded, the suit could potentially wipe out much if not all of the Sacklers’ assets in one fell swoop—making those assets unavailable for the Purdue estate and therefore unavailable for all of the other the victims and creditors.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In sum, if there were no releases, and victims and creditors were therefore free to sue the Sacklers directly, one of three things would likely happen.  One possibility is that no lawsuits against the Sacklers would succeed, and &nbsp;no victim or creditor would recover any money from them.  And without the $5.5 to $6 billion settlement payment, there would be no recovery from Purdue either.  Another possibility is that a large claim or claims would succeed, and the Sacklers would be indemnified by Purdue—thereby wiping out Purdue’s estate for all of the other victims and creditors.  Last, suppose that a large claim succeeded and that the Sacklers were not indemnified for that liability.  Even in that case, only a few victims or creditors would be able to recover from the Sacklers at the expense of fair and equitable distribution to the rest of the victims and creditors.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> As the Second Circuit stated, without the releases, the victims and creditors “would go without any assistance and face an uphill battle of litigation (in which a single claimant might disproportionately recover) without fair distribution.”  69 F.&nbsp;4th, at 80.  Another classic collective-action problem.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In short, without the releases and the significant settlement payment, two separate collective-action problems stood in the way of fair and equitable recovery for the victims and creditors: (1) the Purdue estate would not be preserved for the victims and creditors to obtain recovery, and (2)&nbsp;the Purdue estate would be much smaller than it would be with the Sacklers’ settlement payment.  The releases and settlement payment solved those problems and ensured fair and equitable recovery for the opioid victims.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">C</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> For those reasons, the Bankruptcy Court found that without the releases and settlement payment, the reorganization plan would “unravel.”  633 B.&nbsp;R., at 107, 109.  All of the “heavily negotiated and intricately woven compromises in the plan” that won the victims’ and creditors’ approval, <em>id</em>., at 90, would “fall apart for lack of &nbsp;funding and the inevitable fighting over a far smaller and less certain recovery with its renewed focus on pursuing individual claims and races to collection.”  <em>Id</em>., at 84.  There simply would not be enough money to support a reorganization plan that the victims and creditors would approve.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Absent the releases and settlement payment, the Bankruptcy Court found, the “most likely result” would be liquidation of a much smaller $1.8 billion estate.  <em>Id</em>., at 90.  In a liquidation, the United States would recover first with its $2 billion superpriority claim, taking for itself the whole pie.  And the victims and other creditors “would probably recover nothing.”  <em>Id</em>., at 109.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Given that alternative, it is hardly surprising that the opioid victims and creditors almost universally support Purdue’s Chapter 11 reorganization plan and the non-debtor releases.  That plan promised to obtain significant assets from the Sacklers, to preserve those assets from being depleted by litigation for a few, and to distribute those much-needed funds fairly and equitably.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> As a result, the opioid victims’ and creditors’ support for the reorganization plan was <em>overwhelming</em>.  Every victim and creditor had a chance to vote on the plan during the bankruptcy proceedings.  And of those who voted, more than 95 percent approved of the plan.  <em>Id</em>., at 107.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Since then, even more victims and creditors have gotten on board.  Now, all 50 States have signed on to the plan.  The lineup before this Court is telling.  On one side of the case: the tens of thousands of opioid victims and their families; more than 4,000 state, city, county, tribal, and local government entities; and more than 40,000 hospitals and healthcare organizations.  They all urge the Court to uphold the plan.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; At this point, on the other side of this case stand only a sole individual and a small group of Canadian creditors.<a aria-label=\"reference 4 of Kavanaugh Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-4\" id=\"DISSENT_5-4ref\"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Given all of the extraordinary circumstances, the Bankruptcy Court and Second Circuit concluded that the non-debtor releases here not only were appropriate, but were essential to the success of the plan.  The Bankruptcy Court and Second Circuit thoroughly analyzed each of the relevant factors before reaching that conclusion:  First, the released non-debtors (the Sacklers) closely controlled and were indemnified by the company.  69 F.&nbsp;4th, at 79.  Second, the claims against the Sacklers were based on essentially the same facts and legal theories as the claims against Purdue.  <em>Id</em>., at 80.  Third, the releases were essential for the reorganization to succeed, because the releases protected the Purdue estate from indemnification claims and expanded the Purdue estate to enable victim and creditor recovery.  <em>Id</em>., at 80–81.  Fourth, the releases were narrowly tailored to protect the estate from indemnification claims.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Fifth, the releases secured a substantial settlement payment to significantly increase the funds in the estate.  <em>Id</em>., at 81.  Sixth, that enhanced estate allowed the plan to distribute “fair and equitable” payments to the victims and creditors.  <em>Id</em>., at 82 (quotation marks omitted).  And seventh, for all those reasons, the victims and creditors do not just urgently and overwhelmingly approve of the releases, they all but demanded the releases.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Congress invited bankruptcy courts to consider exactly those kinds of extraordinary circumstances when it &nbsp;authorized bankruptcy plans to include “any other appropriate provision” that is “not inconsistent” with the Code.  §1123(b)(6).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">III</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The Court decides today to reject the plan by holding that non-debtor releases are categorically impermissible as a matter of law.  That decision contravenes the Bankruptcy Code.  It is regrettable for the opioid victims and creditors, and for the heavily negotiated equitable distribution of assets that they overwhelmingly support.  And it will harm victims in pending and future mass-tort bankruptcies.  The Court’s decision deprives the bankruptcy system of a longstanding and critical tool that has been used repeatedly to ensure fair and sizable recovery for victims—to repeat, recovery for <em>victims</em>—in mass torts ranging from Dalkon Shield to the Boy Scouts.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> On the law, the Court’s decision to reject the plan flatly contradicts the Bankruptcy Code.  The Code explicitly grants broad discretion and flexibility for bankruptcy courts to handle bankruptcies of extraordinary complexity like this one.  For several decades, bankruptcy courts have been employing non-debtor releases to facilitate fair and equitable recovery for victims in mass-tort bankruptcies.  In this case, too, the Bankruptcy Court prudently and appropriately employed its discretion to fairly resolve a mass-tort bankruptcy.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> At times, the Court seems to view the Sacklers’ settlement payment into Purdue’s bankruptcy estate as insufficient and the plan as therefore unfair to victims and creditors.  If that were true, one might expect the fight in this case to be over whether the non-debtor releases and settlement amount were “appropriate” given the facts and circumstances of this case.  <a aria-label=\"11 USC 1123 b 6\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1123#b_6\">11 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §1123(b)(6)</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Yet that is not the path the Court takes.  The Court does not contest the Bankruptcy Court’s and Second Circuit’s &nbsp;conclusion that a non-debtor release was necessary and appropriate for the settlement and the success of Purdue’s reorganization—the best, and perhaps the only, chance for victims and creditors to receive fair and equitable compensation.  Indeed, no party has challenged the Bankruptcy Court’s factual findings or made an argument that non-debtor releases were used inappropriately in this specific case.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Instead, the Court categorically decides that non-debtor releases are <em>never </em>allowed as a matter of law.  The text of the Bankruptcy Code does not remotely support that categorical prohibition.<a aria-label=\"reference 5 of Kavanaugh Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-5\" id=\"DISSENT_5-5ref\"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> As explained, §1123(b)(6)’s catchall authority affords bankruptcy courts broad discretion to approve “any other appropriate provision not inconsistent with the applicable provisions” of the Bankruptcy Code.  Recall that §1123(b)(1) expressly authorizes releases of victims’ and creditors’ claims against the debtor company—here, against Purdue.  &nbsp;And recall that §1123(b)(3) expressly authorizes settlements and releases of the debtor company’s claims against non-debtors—here, against the Sacklers.  Section 1123(b)(6)’s catchall authority is easily broad enough to allow settlements and releases of the same victims’ and creditors’ claims against the same non-debtors (the Sacklers), who are indemnified by the debtor and who made a large settlement payment to the debtor’s estate.  After all, the Second Circuit stated that in indemnification relationships “a suit against the non-debtor is, in essence, a suit against the debtor.”  <em>In&nbsp;re Purdue Pharma L.&nbsp;P.</em>, 69 F.&nbsp;4th 45, 78 (2023) (quotation marks omitted).  And even when the officers and directors are not indemnified, the releases may enable a settlement where the non-debtor makes a sizable payment to the estate that can be fairly and equitably distributed to the victims and creditors, rather than being zeroed out by the first successful suit. </p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">A</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> So how does the Court reach its atextual and ahistorical conclusion?  The Court primarily seizes on the canon of <em>ejusdem generis</em>, an interpretive principle that “limits general terms that follow specific ones to matters similar to those specified.”  <em>CSX Transp., Inc.</em> v. <em>Alabama Dept. of Revenue</em>, <a aria-label=\"562 U. S. 277\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/562/277\">562 U.&nbsp;S. 277</a>, 294 (2011) (quotation marks and alteration omitted).  But the Court’s use of that canon here is entirely misguided.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The <em>ejusdem generis </em>canon “applies when a drafter has tacked on a catchall phrase at the end of an enumeration of specifics, as in <em>dogs, cats, horses, cattle, and other animals</em>.”  A. Scalia &amp; B. Garner, Reading Law 199 (2012); see also <em>id</em>., at 200–208 (“trays, glasses, dishes, or other tableware”; “gravel, sand, earth or other material”; and numerous other similar lists (quotation marks omitted)); W. Eskridge, Interpreting Law 77 (2016) (“automobiles, motorcycles, and &nbsp;other mechanisms for conveying persons or things” (quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> As a general matter, as Justice Scalia explained for the Court, a catchall at the end of the list should be construed to cover “matters not specifically contemplated—known unknowns.”  <em>Republic of Iraq</em> v. <em>Beaty</em>, <a aria-label=\"556 U. S. 848\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/556/848\">556 U.&nbsp;S. 848</a>, 860 (2009).  That is the “whole value of a generally phrased residual clause.”  <em>Ibid</em>.  Or stated otherwise, the fact that “a statute can be applied in situations not expressly anticipated by Congress does not demonstrate ambiguity.  It demonstrates breadth.”  <em>Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections</em> v. <em>Yeskey</em>, <a aria-label=\"524 U. S. 206\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/524/206\">524 U.&nbsp;S. 206</a>, 212 (1998) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The <em>ejusdem generis </em>canon can operate to narrow a broad catchall term in certain circumstances.  The canon “parallels common usage,” reflecting the assumption that when “the initial terms all belong to an obvious and readily identifiable genus, one presumes that the speaker or writer has that category in mind for the entire passage.”  Scalia &amp; Garner, Reading Law, at 199.  The canon in essence “implies the addition” of the term “similar” in the catchall so that the catchall does not extend so broadly as to defy common sense.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Rather, the catchall extends to similar things or actions that serve the same statutory “purpose.”  <em>Id</em>., at 208.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Here, the Court applies the canon to breezily conclude that there is an “obvious link” through §§1123(b)(1)–(5) that precludes a non-debtor release provision being approved under §1123(b)(6).  <em>Ante,</em> at 11.  The obvious link, according to the Court, is that plan provisions must “concern <em>the debtor—</em>its rights and responsibilities, and its relationship with its creditors.” <em> Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> As an initial matter, the Court does not explain why its supposed common thread excludes the non-debtor releases at issue here.  Those releases obviously “concern” the debtor in multiple overlapping respects.  <em>Ibid</em>.  As explained, &nbsp;Purdue’s bankruptcy plan released the Sacklers only for claims based on <em>the debtor’s</em> (Purdue’s) misconduct.  See 69 F.&nbsp;4th, at 80 (releasing only claims to which Purdue’s conduct was “a legal cause or a legally relevant factor to the cause of action” (quotation marks omitted)).  The releases therefore applied only to claims held by <em>the debtor’s </em>victims and creditors.  And the releases protected <em>the debtor </em>from indemnification claims.  So the non-debtor releases here did not just “concern” the debtor, they were critical to the debtor’s reorganization.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> So the Court’s purported “link” manages the rare feat of being so vague (“concerns the debtor”?) as to be almost meaningless—and if not meaningless, so broad as to plainly cover non-debtor releases.  It is hard to conjure up a weaker <em>ejusdem generis</em> argument than the one put forth by the Court today.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In any event, even on its own terms, the Court’s <em>ejusdem generis </em>argument is dead wrong for two independent reasons.  First, the Court’s purported common thread is factually incorrect as a description of (b)(1) to (b)(5).  Second, and independent of the first point, black-letter law says that the <em>ejusdem generis </em>canon requires looking at the “evident purpose” of the statute in order to discern a common thread.  Scalia &amp; Garner, Reading Law, at 208; see Eskridge, Interpreting Law, at 78.  And here, the Court’s purported common thread ignores (and indeed guts) the evident purpose of §1123(b).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>First, </em>the Court’s purported common thread is factually incorrect.  The Court says that the “obvious link” through paragraphs (b)(1) to (b)(5) is that all are limited to “<em>the debtor</em>—its rights and responsibilities, and its relationship with its creditors.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 11.  But in multiple respects, that assertion is not accurate.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> For one thing, paragraph (b)(3) allows a bankruptcy court to modify the rights of debtors with respect to<em> non-debtors</em>.  Under (b)(3), a bankruptcy court may approve a &nbsp;reorganization plan that settles, adjusts, or enforces “any claim” that the debtor holds against non-debtor third parties.  That provision allows the debtor’s estate to enter into a settlement agreement with a third party, where the estate agrees to release its claims against the third party in exchange for a settlement payment to the bankruptcy estate.  And the bankruptcy court has the power to approve such a settlement if it finds the settlement fair and in the best interests of the estate.  The bankruptcy court may later enforce that settlement.  See generally 7 Collier on Bankruptcy ¶1123.02[3] (R. Levin &amp; H. Sommer eds., 16th ed. 2023).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Importantly, in some cases, including this one, the debtor’s creditors may hold derivative claims against that same non-debtor third party for the same “harm done to the estate.”  69 F.&nbsp;4th, at 70 (quotation marks omitted).  So when the debtor settles with the non-debtor third party, that settlement also extinguishes the creditors’ derivative claims against the non-debtor.  And the creditors’ consent is not necessary to do so.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> To connect the dots:  A plan provision settling the debtor’s claims against non-debtors under (b)(3) therefore <em>nonconsensually extinguishes creditors’ derivative claims against those non-debtors</em>.  That fact alone defeats the Court’s conclusion that §§1123(b)(1)–(5) deal only with relations between the debtor and creditors.  If a plan provision under (b)(3) can nonconsensually release some of the creditors’ derivative claims against a non-debtor, a plan provision under the catchall in (b)(6) that nonconsensually releases some of the creditors’ direct claims against those same non-debtors is easily of a piece—basically the same thing.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This case illustrates the point.  Some of the more substantial assets of Purdue’s estate are fraudulent transfer claims worth $11 billion that Purdue holds against the non-debtor Sacklers.  <em>In&nbsp;re Purdue Pharma L.&nbsp;P.</em>, 633 &nbsp;B.&nbsp;R. 53, 87 (Bkrtcy. Ct. SDNY 2021).  Under (b)(3), as part of its reorganization plan, Purdue settled the fraudulent transfer claims with the non-debtor Sacklers.  The Bankruptcy Court approved that settlement as fair and equitable.  <em>Id</em>., at 83–95.  That settlement resolved the claims that likely would have had “the best chance of material success among all of the claims against” the Sacklers.  <em>Id</em>., at 109; see also <em>id</em>., at 83.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Notably, the result of that settlement was to also <em>nonconsensually </em>extinguish the victims’ and creditors’ derivative fraudulent transfer claims against the Sacklers.  In the absence of the bankruptcy proceeding, victims and creditors could have litigated the fraudulent transfer claims themselves as derivative claims.  But because Purdue settled the claims under §1123(b)(3), the victims and creditors could no longer do so.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Moreover, not all victims and creditors consented to the release of those derivative claims.  But no one disputes that the Bankruptcy Code authorized that nonconsensual non-debtor release of derivative claims.  See 69 F.&nbsp;4th, at 70 (that conclusion is “well-settled”).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The plan therefore released both the estate’s claims against the Sacklers <em>and</em> highly valuable derivative claims that the victims and creditors held against the Sacklers.  Paragraph (b)(3) therefore demonstrates that §1123(b) reaches beyond just creditor-debtor relationships, particularly when the relationship between creditors and other non-debtors can affect the estate.  That indisputable point alone defeats the Court’s conclusion that §1123(b)’s provisions relate only to the debtor and do not allow releases of claims that victims and creditors hold against non-debtors.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Court tries to sidestep that conclusion by distinguishing derivative claims from direct claims.  Releases of derivative claims, the Court says, are authorized by paragraph (b)(3) “because those claims &nbsp;belong to the debtor’s estate.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 12.  No doubt.  But the question then becomes whether releases of direct claims under (b)(6)’s catchall are relevantly similar to releases of derivative claims that all agree are authorized under (b)(3).  The answer in this case is yes.  Here, both the derivative and<em> </em>direct claims against the Sacklers are held by the same victims and creditors, and both the derivative and direct claims against the Sacklers could deplete Purdue’s estate.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Court’s purported common thread is further contradicted by several other kinds of non-debtor releases that “are commonplace, important to the bankruptcy system, and broadly accepted by the courts and practitioners as necessary and proper” plan provisions under §1123(b)(6).  Brief for American College of Bankruptcy as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 3.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Three examples illustrate the point: consensual non-debtor releases, full-satisfaction non-debtor releases, and exculpation clauses. </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Consensual non-debtor releases are routinely included in bankruptcy plans even though those releases apply to claims by victims or creditors against non-debtors—just like the claims here.  And it is “well-settled that a bankruptcy court may approve” such consensual releases.  69 F.&nbsp;4th, at 70; see also Brief for American College of Bankruptcy as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>5–7.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Consensual releases are uncontroversial, but they are not expressly authorized by the Bankruptcy Code.  So the only provision that could possibly supply authority to include those releases in the bankruptcy plan is the catchall in §1123(b)(6).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Court today does not deny that consensual releases are routine in the bankruptcy context and that courts have long approved them.  See <em>ante</em>, at 18–19.  But where, on the Court’s reading of the Bankruptcy Code, would the bankruptcy court obtain the authority to enter and later enforce that consensual release?</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; One suggestion is that the authority comes from the parties’ consent and is akin to a “contractual agreement.”  Tr. of Oral Arg. 33.  But that theory does not explain what provision of the Bankruptcy Code authorizes consensual releases <em>in bankruptcy plans</em>.  After all, contracts are enforceable under state law, ordinarily in state courts.  But in bankruptcy, consensual releases are routinely part of a reorganization plan with voting overseen by the bankruptcy court and conditions enforceable by the bankruptcy court.  See Brief for American College of Bankruptcy as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>4–7.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> To reiterate, the only provision that could provide such authority is §1123(b)(6).  So if the Court thinks that a consensual release can be part of the plan, even the Court must acknowledge that §1123(b)(6) can reach creditors’ claims against non-debtors.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Court’s purported common thread is still further contradicted by yet another regular bankruptcy practice: full-satisfaction releases.  Full-satisfaction releases provide full payment for creditors’ claims against non-debtors and then release those claims.  When a full-satisfaction release is included in a reorganization plan, the bankruptcy court exercises control over creditors’ claims against non-debtors.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Again, the only provision that could possibly supply authority to include those full-satisfaction releases in a bankruptcy plan is the catchall in §1123(b)(6).  Any contract-law theory would not work for full-satisfaction releases, given that holdout creditors often refuse to consent to full-satisfaction releases.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>In&nbsp;re A.&nbsp;H. Robins Co.</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/880_F.2d_694\">880 F.&nbsp;2d 694</a>, 696, 700, 702 (CA4 1989); <em>In&nbsp;re Boy Scouts of Am. and Del. BSA, LLC</em>, 650 B.&nbsp;R. 87, 115–116, 141 (Del. 2023).  So if full-satisfaction releases are to be allowed, §1123(b)(6) must be read to reach creditor claims against non-debtors, even without consent.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Court does not deny that consensual non-debtor releases and full-satisfaction releases might be permissible &nbsp;under §1123(b)(6).  <em>Ante</em>, at 19.  If they are permissible, then the Court’s purported <em>ejusdem generis</em> common thread is thoroughly eviscerated because those releases involve claims by victims or creditors against non-debtors, just like here.  (And if the Court instead means to hold open the possibility that consensual and full-satisfaction releases are actually impermissible, then its holding today is even more extreme than it appears.)</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Exculpation clauses are yet another example.  Exculpation clauses shield the estate’s fiduciaries and other professionals (non-debtors) from liability for their work on the reorganization plan.  See Brief for American College of Bankruptcy as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>9.  Without such exculpation clauses, “competent professionals would be deterred from engaging in the bankruptcy process, which would undermine the main purpose of chapter 11—achieving a successful restructuring.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 11; see also Brief for Highland Capital Management, L.&nbsp;P. as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 3–5.  For that reason, bankruptcy courts routinely approve exculpation clauses under §1123(b)(6).  For exculpation clauses to be allowed, however, §1123(b)(6) must be read to reach creditor claims against non-debtors.  So exculpation clauses further refute the Court’s purported common thread.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The fact that plan provisions under §1123(b)(6) can reach non-debtors finds still more support in this Court’s only case to analyze the catchall authority in §1123(b)(6), <em>United States </em>v. <em>Energy Resources Co</em>.  The plan provision in <em>Energy Resources</em> ordered the IRS, a creditor, to apply the debtor’s tax payments to trust-fund tax liability before other kinds of tax liability.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Energy Resources Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"495 U. S. 545\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/495/545\">495 U.&nbsp;S. 545</a>, 547 (1990).  Importantly, if the debtor did not pay the trust-fund tax liability, then non-debtor officers of the company would be on the hook.  <em>Ibid.</em>  So the plan provision served to protect the company’s non-debtor officers from “personal liability” for those taxes.  <em>In&nbsp;re Energy Resources Co.</em>, 59 B.&nbsp;R. 702, 704 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Mass. 1986).  In exchange for that protection, a non-debtor officer contributed funds to the bankruptcy plan.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Echoing the Court today, the IRS objected to that plan, arguing that the bankruptcy court exceeded its authority under (b)(6) in part because there was no provision in the Code that expressly supported the plan provision.  <em>Energy Resources</em>, 495 U.&nbsp;S., at 549–550.  But this Court disagreed with the IRS and approved the plan based on the “residual authority” in (b)(6).  <em>Id</em>., at 549.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The plan provision in <em>Energy Resources </em>operated akin to a non-debtor release:  It reduced the potential liability of a non-debtor (the non-debtor’s officers) to another non-debtor (the IRS).  <em>Energy Resources</em> therefore further demonstrates that plan provisions under §1123(b)(6) can affect creditor–non-debtor relationships.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In sum, the Court’s statement that §1123(b) reaches only “<em>the debtor</em>—its rights and responsibilities, and its relationship with its creditors,” <em>ante,</em> at 11, is factually incorrect several times over.  Paragraphs 1123(b)(3) and (b)(6) already allow plans to affect creditor claims against non-debtors, such as through releases of creditors’ derivative claims, consensual releases, full-satisfaction releases, and exculpation clauses.  And this Court’s precedent in <em>Energy Resources </em>confirms the point.  The Court’s <em>ejusdem generis</em> argument rests on quicksand.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Second</em>, independent of those many flaws, the Court’s entire approach to <em>ejusdem generis </em>is wrong from the get-go.  When courts face a statute with a catchall, it is black-letter law that courts must try to discern the common thread by examining the “evident purpose” of the statute.  Scalia &amp; Garner, Reading Law, at 208; see also <em>Begay</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"553 U. S. 137\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/553/137\">553 U.&nbsp;S. 137</a>, 146 (2008) (defining common thread “in terms of the Act’s basic purposes”); Eskridge, &nbsp;Interpreting Law, at 78 (“statutory purpose” helps identify the common thread in<em> ejusdem generis </em>cases).<a aria-label=\"reference 6 of Kavanaugh Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-6\" id=\"DISSENT_5-6ref\"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Importantly, this Court has already explained that the purpose of §1123(b) is to grant bankruptcy courts “broad power” to approve plan provisions “necessary for a reorganization’s success.”  <em>Energy Resources</em>, 495 U.&nbsp;S., at 551.  <em>Energy Resources </em>demonstrates that the common thread of §1123(b) is bankruptcy court action to preserve the estate and ensure fair and equitable recovery for creditors.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Pioneer Investment Services Co.</em> v. <em>Brunswick Associates L.&nbsp;P.</em>, <a aria-label=\"507 U. S. 380\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/507/380\">507 U.&nbsp;S. 380</a>, 389 (1993); <em>NLRB</em> v. <em>Bildisco &amp; Bildisco</em>, <a aria-label=\"465 U. S. 513\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/465/513\">465 U.&nbsp;S. 513</a>, 528 (1984); J.&nbsp;Feeney &amp; M.&nbsp;Stepan, 2 Bankruptcy Law Manual §11:1 (5th ed. 2023).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> As explained at length above, to maximize recovery, the Court must solve complex collective-action problems.  And for a bankruptcy court to solve all of the relevant collective-action problems, §§1123(b)(1)–(5) give the bankruptcy court broad power to modify parties’ rights without their consent—most notably, to release creditors’ claims against the debtor.  §1123(b)(1).  Under that provision, the Purdue plan released the victims’ and creditors’ claims <em>against Purdue</em> in order to prevent a collective-action problem in distributing Purdue’s assets—and thereby to preserve the estate and ensure fair and equitable recovery for victims and creditors.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; The non-debtor release provision approved under §1123(b)(6) does the same thing and serves that same statutory purpose.  As discussed above, the victims’ and creditors’ claims against the non-debtor Purdue officers and directors (the Sacklers) are essentially the same as their claims against Purdue.  The claims against the Sacklers rest on the same legal theories and facts as the claims against Purdue, largely the Sacklers’ opioid-related decisions in running Purdue.  And the Sacklers are indemnified by Purdue’s estate for their liability.  So any liability could potentially come out of the Purdue estate just like the claims against Purdue itself.  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Therefore, the nonconsensual releases against the Sacklers are not only of a similar genus, but in effect <em>the same</em> <em>thing</em> as the nonconsensual releases against Purdue that everyone agrees §1123(b)(1) already authorizes.  Both were necessary to preserve the estate and prevent collective-action problems that could drain Purdue’s estate, and thus both were necessary to enable Purdue’s reorganization plan to succeed and to equitably distribute assets. And without the releases, there would be no settlement, meaning no $5.5 to $6 billion payment by the Sacklers to Purdue’s estate.  That would mean either that no victim or creditor could recover anything from the Sacklers (or indeed from Purdue), or that only a few victims or creditors could recover from the Sacklers at the expense of fair and equitable distribution to everyone else.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The statute’s evident purpose therefore easily answers the <em>ejusdem generis </em>inquiry here.  Absent other limitations and restrictions in the Code, §1123(b)(6) authorizes a bankruptcy court to modify parties’ claims that could otherwise threaten to deplete the bankruptcy estate when doing so is necessary to preserve the estate and provide fair and equitable recovery for creditors.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In light of the “evident purpose” of §1123(b) to preserve the estate and ensure fair and equitable recovery for &nbsp;creditors in the face of collective-action problems, Scalia &amp; Garner, Reading Law, at 208; see Eskridge, Interpreting Law, at 78, the Court’s <em>ejusdem generis </em>theory simply falls apart.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In sum, for each of two independent reasons, the Court’s <em>ejusdem generis</em> argument fails.  First, its common thread is factually wrong.  And second, its purported common thread disregards the evident purpose of §1123(b).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Despite the fact that non-debtor releases address the very collective-action problem that the bankruptcy system was designed to solve, the Court next trots out a few minimally explained arguments that non-debtor release provisions are “inconsistent with” various provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, including:  (i)&nbsp;§524(g)’s authorization of non-debtor releases in asbestos cases; (ii)&nbsp;§524(e)’s statement that debtors’ discharges do not automatically affect others’ liabilities; and (iii)&nbsp;the Code’s various restrictions on bankruptcy discharges.  None of those arguments is persuasive.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>First</em>, the Court cites §524(g), which was enacted in 1994 to expressly authorize non-debtor releases in a specific context: cases involving mass harm “caused by the presence of, or exposure to, asbestos or asbestos-containing products.”  §524(g)(2)(B)(i)(I).  From the fact that §524(g) allows non-debtor releases in the asbestos context, the Court infers that non-debtor releases are prohibited in other contexts.  <em>Ante,</em> at 15.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> But the very text of §524(g) <em>expressly precludes</em> the Court’s inference.  The statute says: “Nothing in [§524(g)] shall be construed to modify, impair, or supersede any other authority the court has to issue injunctions in connection with an order confirming a plan of reorganization.”  <a href=\"/rio/citation/108_Stat._4117\">108 Stat. 4117</a>, note following <a aria-label=\"11 USC 524\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/524\">11 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §524</a>.  Congress expressly authorized non-debtor releases in one specific &nbsp;context that was critically urgent in 1994 when it was enacted.  But Congress also enacted the corresponding rule of construction into binding statutory text to “make clear” that §524(g) did not “alter” the bankruptcy courts’ ability to use non-debtor release mechanisms as appropriate in other cases.  140 Cong. Rec. 27692 (1994).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Keep in mind that Congress enacted §524(g) in the early days of non-debtor releases, soon after bankruptcy courts began approving non-debtor releases in asbestos cases.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>In re Johns-Manville Corp.</em>, 68 B.&nbsp;R. 618, 621–622 (Bkrtcy. Ct. SDNY 1986), aff&nbsp;’d, <a href=\"/rio/citation/837_F.2d_89\">837 F.&nbsp;2d 89</a>, 90 (CA2 1988); <em>UNARCO Bloomington Factory Workers</em> v. <em>UNR Industries, Inc.</em>, 124 B.&nbsp;R. 268, 272, 278–279 (ND&nbsp;Ill. 1990).  Section 524(g) set forth a detailed scheme sensitive to the specific needs of asbestos mass-tort litigation that was then engulfing and overwhelming American courts.  For example, because asbestos injuries often have a long latency period, asbestos mass-tort bankruptcies needed to account for unknown claimants who could come out of the woodwork in the future.  See Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994, <a href=\"/rio/citation/108_Stat._4114\">108 Stat. 4114</a>–4116; <em>In&nbsp;re Johns-Manville Corp.</em>, 68 B.&nbsp;R., at 627–629.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> But as explained above, throughout the history of the Code and at the time §524(g) was enacted, bankruptcy courts were also issuing non-debtor releases in other contexts as well, such as in the Dalkon Shield mass-tort bankruptcy case.  <em>A.&nbsp;H. Robins Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"880 F.2d 700\" href=\"/rio/citation/880_F.2d_700\">880 F.&nbsp;2d, at 700</a>–702; see also, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>In&nbsp;re Drexel Burnham Lambert Group, Inc.</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/960_F.2d_285\">960 F.&nbsp;2d 285</a>, 293 (CA2 1992) (securities litigation context).  Congress therefore made clear that enacting §524(g) for the urgent asbestos cases did not disturb bankruptcy courts’ preexisting authority to issue such releases in other cases.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Bottom line:  The Court’s reliance on §524(g) directly contravenes the actual statutory text.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Second</em>, the Court cites §524(e), which states that a plan’s discharge of the debtor “does not affect the liability of any &nbsp;other entity on .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. such debt.”  By its terms, §524(e) does not purport to preclude releases of creditors’ claims against non-debtors.  (And were the rule otherwise, even consensual releases would be prohibited as well.)</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Notably, Congress changed §524(e) to its current wording in 1979.  Before 1979, the statute arguably did preclude releases of claims against non-debtors who were co-debtors with a bankrupt company.  See <a aria-label=\"11 USC 34\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/34\">11 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §34</a> (1976 ed.) (repealed Oct. 1, 1979) (“The liability of a person who is a co-debtor with, or guarantor or in any manner a surety for, a bankrupt <em>shall not</em> be altered by the discharge of such bankrupt” (emphasis added)).  But Congress then changed the law.  And the text now means only that the discharge of the debtor does not <em>itself </em>automatically wipe away the liability of a non-debtor.  Section 524(e) does not speak to the issue of non-debtor releases or other steps that a plan may take regarding the liability of a non-debtor for the same debt.  As the American College of Bankruptcy says, “Section 524(e) is agnostic as to third-party releases.”  Brief for American College of Bankruptcy as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>6, n.&nbsp;3; see also <em>In re Airadigm Communications, Inc.</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/519_F.3d_640\">519 F. 3d 640</a>, 656 (CA7 2008).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Third</em>, citing §§523(a), 524(a), and 541(a), the Court says that the plan improperly grants a “discharge” to the Sacklers.  <em>Ante,</em> at 4, 14–15.  And the Court suggests that giving the Sacklers a “discharge” in Purdue’s bankruptcy plan in exchange for $5.5 to $6 billion allows the Sacklers to get away too easy—without filing for bankruptcy themselves, without having to comply with the Code’s various restrictions, and without paying enough.  See <em>ante,</em> at 14–15.  That point also fails.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> To begin, the premise is incorrect.  The Sacklers did not receive a bankruptcy discharge in this case.  Discharge is a term of art in the Bankruptcy Code.  <em>Wainer</em> v. <em>A.&nbsp;J. Equities, Ltd.</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/984_F.2d_679\">984 F.&nbsp;2d 679</a>, 684 (CA5 1993); J. Silverstein, Hiding in Plain View: A Neglected Supreme Court Decision &nbsp;Resolves the Debate Over Non-Debtor Releases in Chapter 11 Reorganizations, 23 Emory Bkrtcy. Developments J. 13, 130 (2006).  When a debtor in bankruptcy receives a discharge, most (if not all) of their pre-petition debts are released, giving the debtor a fresh start.   See §1141(d)(1) (Chapter 11 discharge relieves the debtor “from any debt that arose before the date of&nbsp;” plan confirmation, with narrow exceptions); <em>Taggart</em> v. <em>Lorenzen</em>, <a aria-label=\"587 U. S. 554\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/587/554\">587 U.&nbsp;S. 554</a>, 556, 558 (2019).  The Sacklers did not receive such a discharge.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> As courts have always recognized, non-debtor releases are different.  Non-debtor releases “do not offer the umbrella protection of a discharge in bankruptcy.”  <em>Johns-Manville Corp.</em>, <a aria-label=\"837 F.2d 91\" href=\"/rio/citation/837_F.2d_91\">837 F.&nbsp;2d, at 91</a>.  Rather, non-debtor releases are accompanied by settlement payments to the estate by the non-debtor.  So non-debtor releases are simply one part of a settlement of pending or potential claims against the non-debtor that arise out of some torts committed by the debtor.  They are in essence a traditional litigation settlement.  They are not a blanket discharge for the non-debtor.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Here, therefore, the releases apply only to certain claims against the Sacklers—namely, those “that arise out of or relate to” Purdue’s bankruptcy.  <em>Ibid</em>.; see 69 F.&nbsp;4th, at 80 (releasing the Sacklers only for claims to which Purdue’s conduct was “a legal cause or a legally relevant factor to the cause of action” (quotation marks omitted)).  And the non-debtor releases were negotiated in exchange for a significant settlement payment that enabled <em>Purdue’s</em> bankruptcy reorganization to succeed.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In short, the releases do not grant discharges to non-debtors and cannot be disallowed on that basis.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Next, the Court suggests that the Sacklers must file for bankruptcy themselves in order to be released from liability.  That, too, is incorrect.  Nowhere does the Code say that a non-debtor may be released from liability only by &nbsp;filing for bankruptcy.  On the contrary, §1123(b)(3) of the Code already expressly allows a bankruptcy plan to release a non-debtor from liability to the debtor.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Court’s suggestion that a non-debtor must file for bankruptcy in order to be released from liability not only is directly at odds with the text of the Code, but also is at odds with reality.  Non-debtor releases are often used in situations where it is not possible or practicable for the non-debtors to simply file for individual bankruptcies.  This case is just one example.  The “Sacklers are not a simple group of a few defendants” that could simply have declared one bankruptcy.  633 B.&nbsp;R., at 88.  They are “a large family divided into two sides, Side A and Side B, with eight pods or groups of family members within those divisions,” many of whom live abroad (beyond bankruptcy jurisdiction).  <em>Ibid</em>.  And their assets are spread across trusts that are likely beyond the jurisdiction of U. S. courts as well.  <em>Ibid</em>.; see also <em>id</em>., at 109.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Likewise, in many other mass-tort bankruptcy cases, released non-parties could not simply declare their own bankruptcies either.  Insurers, for example, cannot declare bankruptcy just because a policy limit is reached.  B.&nbsp;Zaretsky, Insurance Proceeds in Bankruptcy, 55 Brooklyn L. Rev. 373, 394–395, and n.&nbsp;60 (1989).  And in cases involving hundreds of affiliated entities who share liability and share insurance, such as the Boy Scouts and the Catholic Church, it would be almost impossible to coordinate assets and ensure equitable victim recovery across hundreds of distinct bankruptcies.  Section §1123(b)(6) provides bankruptcy courts with flexibility to deal with such situations by approving appropriate non-debtor releases.  See Brief for Boy Scouts of America as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 18–20; Brief for Ad Hoc Group of Local Councils of the Boy Scouts of America as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 6; Brief for U. S. Conference of Catholic Bishops as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 3–4, 17–22.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; The Court next says that the non-debtor release allowed the Sacklers to bypass certain restrictions on discharges—for example, that individual debtors are generally not discharged for fraud claims, §523(a).  That argument fails for the same reason.  Non-debtor releases are part of a negotiated settlement of potential tort claims.  They are not a discharge.  And nothing in §523(a) prohibits a debtor’s reorganization plan from <em>releasing</em> non-debtors for fraud claims.  Indeed, it is undisputed that Purdue’s bankruptcy could release the Sacklers from at least some fraud claims—namely, the fraudulent transfer claims—under §1123(b)(3).  No provision in the Code forbids releasing other fraud claims against the Sacklers, too.  The Court’s concern that the releases apply to claims for “fraud,” <em>ante,</em> at 15, therefore falls flat.  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In all of those scattershot arguments, the Court seems concerned that the Sacklers’ $5.5 to $6 billion settlement payment was not enough.  To begin with, even if that were true, it would not be a reason to <em>categorically </em>disallow non-debtor releases as a matter of law, as the Court does today.  In any event, that concern is unsupported by the record and contradicted by the Bankruptcy Court’s undisputed findings of fact.  The Bankruptcy Court found that the creditors’ and victims’ ability to recover directly from any of the Sacklers in tort litigation was far from certain.  So as in other tort settlements, the settlement amount here reflected the parties’ assessments of their probabilities of success and the likely amount of possible recovery.  The Court today has no good basis for its subtle second-guessing of the settlement amount.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> And lest we miss the forest for the trees, keep in mind that the victims and creditors have no incentive to short their own recoveries or to let the Sacklers off easy.  They despise the Sacklers.  Yet they strongly support the plan.  They call the settlement a “remarkable achievement.”  Brief for Respondent Ad Hoc Group of Individual Victims of &nbsp;Purdue Pharma, L.&nbsp;P. et&nbsp;al. 2.  And given the high level of victim and creditor support, the Bankruptcy Court emphasized: “[T]his is <em>not</em> the Sacklers’ plan,” and “anyone who contends to the contrary” is “simply misleading the public.”  633 B.&nbsp;R., at 82.  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Court today unfortunately falls into that trap.  And it is rather paternalistic for the Court to tell the victims that they should have done better—and then to turn around and leave them with potentially nothing.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">C</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Finally, the Court suggests that non-debtor releases are not “appropriate” because they are inconsistent with history and practice.  That, too, is seriously mistaken.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Importantly, Congress did not enact the current Bankruptcy Code—and with it, §1123(b)(6)—until 1978.  Bankruptcy Code of 1978, <a href=\"/rio/citation/92_Stat._2549\">92 Stat. 2549</a>.  For nearly the entire life of the Code, courts have approved non-debtor release provisions like this one.  So for decades, Chapter 11 of the Code has been understood to grant authority for such releases when appropriate and necessary to the success of the reorganization.<a aria-label=\"reference 7 of Kavanaugh Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-7\" id=\"DISSENT_5-7ref\"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Court’s citations to pre-Bankruptcy Code cases are an off-point deflection and do not account for important and relevant changes made in the current Bankruptcy Code.  &nbsp;For example, unlike the former Bankruptcy Act of 1898, the modern Bankruptcy Code grants courts jurisdiction over “suits between third parties which have an effect on the bankruptcy estate.”  <em>Celotex Corp.</em> v. <em>Edwards</em>, <a aria-label=\"514 U. S. 300\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/514/300\">514 U.&nbsp;S. 300</a>, 307, n.&nbsp;5 (1995); see <a aria-label=\"28 USC\" href=\"/uscode/text/28\">28</a> U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §§<a aria-label=\"28 USC 157 a\" href=\"/uscode/text/28/157#a\">157(a)</a>, <a aria-label=\"28 USC 1334 b\" href=\"/uscode/text/28/1334#b\">1334(b)</a> (giving bankruptcy courts jurisdiction over any litigation “related to” the bankruptcy).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Under the current Bankruptcy Code, it is well settled that Chapter 11 bankruptcies can and do affect relationships between creditors and non-debtors who are intimately related to the bankruptcy.  For example, under the modern Bankruptcy Code, bankruptcy courts routinely use their broad jurisdiction and equitable powers to stay any litigation—even litigation entirely between third parties—that would affect the bankruptcy estate.  <em>Celotex</em>, 514 U.&nbsp;S., at 308–310.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The longstanding practice of staying litigation that could affect the bankruptcy estate is similar in important respects to non-debtor releases.  In each situation, a provision of the Code provides an explicit authority: to stay litigation involving the debtor, §362, and to release claims involving the debtor, §§1123(b)(1), (3).  And in each, the bankruptcy court invokes its broad jurisdiction and equitable power to “augment” that authority, extending it to litigation and claims against non-debtors that might have a “direct and substantial adverse effect” on the bankruptcy estate.  <em>Celotex</em>, 514 U.&nbsp;S., at 303, 310.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In short, the common and long-accepted practice of staying litigation that could affect the bankruptcy estate shows that under the modern Code, bankruptcy courts can and do exercise control over relationships between creditors &nbsp;and non-debtors.  The Court’s reliance on pre-Code practice is misplaced.<a aria-label=\"reference 8 of Kavanaugh Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-8\" id=\"DISSENT_5-8ref\"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">IV</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> As I see it, today’s decision makes little sense legally, practically, or economically.  It upends the carefully negotiated Purdue bankruptcy plan and the prompt and substantial recovery guaranteed to opioid victims and creditors.  Now the opioid victims and creditors are left holding the bag, with no clear path forward.  To reiterate the words of the victims:  “Without the release, the plan will unravel,” and “there will be no viable path to any victim recovery.”  Tr. of Oral Arg. 100.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Court does not say what should happen next.  The Court seems to hope that a new deal is possible, with the Sacklers buying off the last holdouts.  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> But even if it were true that the parties could eventually reach a new deal, that outcome would likely come at a cost.  Future negotiations and litigation would mean additional litigation expense that eats away at the recovery that the opioid victims and creditors have already negotiated, as well as years of additional delay even though victims and family members want and need relief <em>now</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> And more to the point, without non-debtor releases, a new deal will be very difficult to achieve.  By eliminating nonconsensual non-debtor releases, today’s decision gives every victim and every creditor an absolute right to sue the Sacklers.  Some may hold out from any potential future settlement and instead sue because they want to have their day in court to hold the defendants accountable, or because they want to try to hit the jackpot of a large recovery that they can keep all to themselves.  Moreover, because every &nbsp;victim and creditor knows that the Sacklers’ resources are limited, they will now have an incentive to promptly sue the Sacklers before others sue.  To be sure, the victims and creditors would face an uphill climb in any such litigation, the Bankruptcy Court found, so it may be that no one will succeed in tort litigation against the Sacklers, meaning that no one will get anything.  But even if just one of the victims or creditors—say, a State or a group of victims—is successful in a suit against the Sacklers, its judgment “could wipe out all of the collectible Sackler assets,” which in turn could also deplete Purdue’s estate and leave nothing<em> </em>for any other victim or creditor.  <em>Id</em>., at 103.  That reality means that everyone has an incentive to race to the courthouse to sue the Sacklers pronto—the classic collective-action problem.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Because some victims or creditors may hold out from any potential future settlement for any one of those reasons and instead still sue, the Sacklers are less likely to settle with anyone in the first place.  Maybe the clouds will part.  But in a world where nonconsensual non-debtor releases are categorically impermissible, any hope for a new deal seems questionable—indeed, the parties to the bankruptcy label it “pure fantasy.”  Brief for Debtor Respondents 4. </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The bankruptcy system was designed to prevent that exact sort of collective-action problem.  Non-debtor releases have been indispensable to solving that problem and ensuring fair and equitable <em>victim recovery</em> in multiple bankruptcy proceedings of extraordinary scale—not only opioids, but also many other mass-tort cases involving asbestos, the Boy Scouts, the Catholic Church, silicone breast implants, the Dalkon Shield, and others.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Court’s apparent concern that the Sacklers’ settlement payment of $5.5 to $6 billion was not enough should have led at most to a remand on whether the releases were “appropriate” under <a aria-label=\"11 USC 1123 b 6\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1123#b_6\">11 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §1123(b)(6)</a> (if anyone had raised that argument here, which they have &nbsp;not).  But instead the Court responds with the dramatic step of repudiating the plan and eliminating non-debtor releases altogether.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Court’s decision today jettisons a carefully circumscribed and critically important tool that bankruptcy courts have long used and continue to need to handle mass-tort bankruptcies going forward.  The text of the Bankruptcy Code does not come close to requiring such a ruinous result.  Nor does its structure, context, or history.  Nor does hostility to the Sacklers—no matter how deep:  “Nothing is more antithetical to the purpose of bankruptcy than destroying estate value to punish someone.”  A. Casey &amp; J. Macey, In Defense of Chapter 11 for Mass Torts, 90 U.&nbsp;Chi. L. Rev. 973, 1017 (2023).  Gutting this longstanding bankruptcy court practice is entirely counterproductive, and simply inflicts still more injury on the opioid victims.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Opioid victims and other future victims of mass torts will suffer greatly in the wake of today’s unfortunate and destabilizing decision.  Only Congress can fix the chaos that will now ensue.  The Court’s decision will lead to too much harm for too many people for Congress to sit by idly without at least carefully studying the issue.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<h3 class=\"fnheader\">Notes</h3>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_5-1\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Kavanaugh Dissent at reference 1\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-1ref\">1</a> &nbsp;The full text of §1123(b) provides that “a plan may— “(1) impair or leave unimpaired any class of claims, secured or unsecured, or of interests; “(2) subject to section 365 of this title, provide for the assumption, rejection, or assignment of any executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor not previously rejected under such section; “(3) provide for— “(A) the settlement or adjustment of any claim or interest belonging to the debtor or to the estate; or “(B) the retention and enforcement by the debtor, by the trustee, or by a representative of the estate appointed for such purpose, of any such claim or interest; “(4) provide for the sale of all or substantially all of the property of the estate, and the distribution of the proceeds of such sale among holders of claims or interests; “(5) modify the rights of holders of secured claims, other than a claim secured only by a security interest in real property that is the debtor’s principal residence, or of holders of unsecured claims, or leave unaffected the rights of holders of any class of claims; and “(6) include any other appropriate provision not inconsistent with the applicable provisions of this title.”</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_5-2\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Kavanaugh Dissent at reference 2\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-2ref\">2</a> &nbsp;Other Courts of Appeals have used similar factors for evaluating non-debtor releases.

Three such statues are relevant: The Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  These Acts respectively govern the registration of securities, the trading of securities, and the activities of investment advisers.  Although each regulates different aspects of the securities markets, their pertinent provisions—collectively referred to by regulators as “the antifraud provisions,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 73a, 202a—target the same basic behavior: misrepresenting or concealing material facts.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-d jy-both indent_l-187 indent_h-187\">  To enforce these Acts, Congress created the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The SEC may bring an enforcement action in one of two forums.  It can file suit in federal court, or it can adjudicate the matter itself.  The forum the SEC selects dictates certain aspects of the litigation.  In federal court, a jury finds the facts, an Article III judge presides, and the Federal Rules of Evidence and the ordinary rules of discovery govern the litigation.  But when the SEC adjudicates the matter in-house, there are no juries.  The Commission presides while its Division of Enforcement prosecutes the case.  The Commission or its delegee—typically an Administrative Law Judge—also finds facts and decides discovery disputes, and the SEC’s Rules of Practice govern.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-d jy-both indent_l-187 indent_h-187\">  One remedy for securities violations is civil penalties.  Originally, the SEC could only obtain civil penalties from unregistered investment advisers in federal court.  Then, in 2010, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.  The Act authorized the SEC to impose such penalties through its own in-house &nbsp;proceedings.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-d jy-both indent_l-187 indent_h-187\">  Shortly after passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC initiated an enforcement action for civil penalties against investment adviser George Jarkesy, Jr., and his firm, Patriot28, LLC for alleged violations of the “antifraud provisions” contained in the federal securities laws.  The SEC opted to adjudicate the matter in-house.  As relevant, the final order determined that Jarkesy and Patriot28 had committed securities violations and levied a civil penalty of $300,000.  Jarkesy and Patriot28 petitioned for judicial review.  The Fifth Circuit vacated the order on the ground that adjudicating the matter in-house violated the defendants’ <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-e jy-both\"><em>Held</em>:&nbsp;When the SEC seeks civil penalties against a defendant for securities fraud, the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> entitles the defendant to a jury trial.  Pp.&nbsp;6–27.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> (a)&nbsp;The question presented by this case—whether the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> entitles a defendant to a jury trial when the SEC seeks civil penalties for securities fraud—is straightforward.  Following the analysis set forth in <em>Granfinanciera, S. A.</em> v. <em>Nordberg</em>, <a aria-label=\"492 U. S. 33\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/492/33\">492 U.&nbsp;S. 33</a>, and <em>Tull</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"481 U. S. 412\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/481/412\">481 U.&nbsp;S. 412</a>, this action implicates the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> because the SEC’s antifraud provisions replicate common law fraud.  And the “public rights” exception to Article III jurisdiction does not apply, because the present action does not fall within any of the distinctive areas involving governmental prerogatives where the Court has concluded that a matter may be resolved outside of an Article III court, without a jury.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> (b)&nbsp;The Court first explains why this action implicates the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\">  (1)&nbsp;The right to trial by jury is “of such importance and occupies so firm a place in our history and jurisprudence that any seeming curtailment of the right” has always been and “should be scrutinized with the utmost care.”  <em>Dimick</em> v. <em>Schiedt</em>, <a aria-label=\"293 U. S. 474\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/293/474\">293 U.&nbsp;S. 474</a>, 486.  When the British attempted to evade American juries by siphoning adjudications to juryless admiralty, vice admiralty, and chancery courts, the Americans protested and eventually cited the British practice as a justification for declaring Independence.  In the Revolution’s aftermath, concerns that the proposed Constitution lacked a provision guaranteeing a jury trial right in civil cases was perhaps the “most success[ful]” critique leveled against the document during the ratification debates.  The Federalist No. 83, p. 495.  To fix that flaw, the Framers promptly adopted the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a>.  Ever since, “every encroachment upon [the jury trial right] has been watched with great jealousy.”  <em>Parsons</em> v. <em>Bedford</em>, 3 Pet. 433, 446.  Pp.&nbsp;7–8.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\">  (2)&nbsp;The <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> guarantees that in “[s]uits at common law .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the right of trial by jury shall be preserved.”  The right &nbsp;itself is not limited to the “common-law forms of action recognized” when the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> was ratified.  <em>Curtis</em> v. <em>Loether</em>, <a aria-label=\"415 U. S. 189\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/415/189\">415 U.&nbsp;S. 189</a>, 193.  Rather, it “embrace[s] all suits which are not of equity or admiralty jurisdiction, whatever may be the peculiar form which they may assume.”  <em>Parsons</em>, 3 Pet., at 447.  That includes statutory claims that are “legal in nature.”  <em>Granfinanciera</em>, 492 U.&nbsp;S., at 53.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\"> To determine whether a suit is legal in nature, courts must consider whether the cause of action resembles common law causes of action, and whether the remedy is the sort that was traditionally obtained in a court of law.  Of these factors, the remedy is the more important.  And in this case, the remedy is all but dispositive.  For respondents’ alleged fraud, the SEC seeks civil penalties, a form of monetary relief.  Such relief is legal in nature when it is designed to punish or deter the wrongdoer rather than solely to “restore the status quo.”  <em>Tull</em>, 481 U.&nbsp;S., at 422.  The Acts condition the availability and size of the civil penalties available to the SEC based on considerations such as culpability, deterrence, and recidivism.  See §§77h–1; 78u–2, 80b–3.  These factors go beyond restoring the status quo and so are legal in nature.  The SEC is also not obligated to use civil penalties to compensate victims.  SEC civil penalties are thus “a type of remedy at common law that could only be enforced in courts of law.”  <em>Tull</em>, 481 U.&nbsp;S., at 422.  This suit implicates the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> right and a defendant would be entitled to a jury on these claims.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> The close relationship between federal securities fraud and common law fraud confirms that conclusion.  Both target the same basic conduct: misrepresenting or concealing material facts.  By using “fraud” and other common law terms of art when it drafted the federal securities laws, Congress incorporated common law fraud prohibitions into those laws.  This Court therefore often considers common law fraud principles when interpreting federal securities law.  See, <em>e.g., Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</em> v. <em>Broudo</em>, <a aria-label=\"544 U. S. 336\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/544/336\">544 U.&nbsp;S. 336</a>, 343–344.  While federal securities fraud and common law fraud are not identical, the close relationship between the two confirms that this action is “legal in nature.”  <em>Granfinanciera</em>, 492 U.&nbsp;S., at 53.  Pp.&nbsp;8–13.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> (c)&nbsp;Because the claims at issue here implicate the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a>, a jury trial is required unless the “public rights” exception applies.  Under this exception, Congress may assign the matter for decision to an agency without a jury, consistent with the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a>.  For the reasons below, the exception does not apply.  Pp.&nbsp;13–27.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\">  (1)&nbsp;The Constitution prevents Congress from “withdraw[ing] from judicial cognizance any matter which, from its nature, is the subject of a suit at the common law.”  <em>Murray’s Lessee</em> v. <em>Hoboken Land &amp; Improvement Co.</em>, 18 How. 272, 284.  Once such a suit “is brought within &nbsp;the bounds of federal jurisdiction,” an Article III court must decide it, with a jury if the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> applies.  <em>Stern</em> v. <em>Marshall</em>, <a aria-label=\"564 U. S. 462\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/564/462\">564 U.&nbsp;S. 462</a>, 484.  On that basis, this Court has repeatedly explained that matters concerning private rights may not be removed from Article III courts.  See, <em>e.g., Murray’s Lessee, </em>18 How., at 284.  If a suit is in the nature of an action at common law, then the matter presumptively concerns private rights, and adjudication by an Article III court is mandatory.  <em>Stern</em>, 564 U.&nbsp;S., at 484.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> The Court also recognizes a class of cases concerning “public rights.”  Such matters “historically could have been determined exclusively by [the executive and legislative] branches.”  <em>Id.,</em> at 493 (internal quotation marks omitted).  No involvement by an Article III court in the initial adjudication of public rights claims is necessary.  Certain categories that have been recognized as falling within the exception include matters concerning: the collection of revenue; aspects of customs law; immigration law; relations with Indian tribes; the administration of public lands; and the granting of public benefits.  The Court’s opinions governing this exception have not always spoken in precise terms.  But “even with respect to matters that arguably fall within the scope of the ‘public rights’ doctrine, the presumption is in favor of Article III courts.”  <em>Northern Pipeline Constr. Co.</em> v. <em>Marathon Pipe Line Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"458 U. S. 50\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/458/50\">458 U.&nbsp;S. 50</a>, 69, n.&nbsp;23 (plurality opinion).  Pp.&nbsp;13–18.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\">  (2)&nbsp;In <em>Granfinanciera</em>, this Court previously considered whether the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> guarantees the right to a jury trial “in the face of Congress’ decision to allow a non-Article III tribunal to adjudicate” a statutory “fraud claim.”  492 U.&nbsp;S., at 37, 50.  There the issue was whether Congress’s designation of fraudulent conveyance actions as “core [bankruptcy] proceedings” authorized non-Article III bankruptcy judges to hear them without juries.  <em>Id.</em>, at 50.  The Court held that the designation was not permissible, even under the public rights exception.  To determine whether the claim implicated the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a>, the Court applied the principles distilled in <em>Tull.  </em>Surveying English cases and considering the remedy these suits provided, the Court concluded that fraudulent conveyance actions were “quintessentially suits at common law.”  <em>Granfinanciera</em>, 492 U.&nbsp;S., at 56.  Because these actions were akin to “suits at common law” and were not “closely intertwined” with the bankruptcy process, the Court held that the public rights exception did not apply, and a jury was required.  <em>Id.,</em> at 54, 56.  Pp.&nbsp;19–20.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\">  (3)&nbsp;<em>Granfinanciera</em> effectively decides this case.  The action here was brought under the “anti-fraud provisions” of the federal securities laws and provide civil penalties that can “only be enforced in courts of law.”  <em>Tull</em>, 481 U.&nbsp;S., at 422.  They target the same basic conduct as &nbsp;common law fraud, employ the same terms of art, and operate pursuant to similar legal principles.  In short, this action involves a “matter[&nbsp;] of private rather than public right.”  <em>Granfinanciera</em>, 492 U.&nbsp;S., at 56.  Pp.&nbsp;20–21.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\">  (4)&nbsp;The SEC claims that the public rights exception applies because Congress created “new statutory obligations, impose[d] civil penalties for their violation, and then commit[ted] to an administrative agency the function of deciding whether a violation ha[d] in fact occurred.”  Brief for Petitioner 21.  <em>Granfinanciera</em> does away with much of the SEC’s argument.  Congress cannot “conjure away the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> by mandating that traditional legal claims be .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. taken to an administrative tribunal.” <em> </em>492 U.&nbsp;S., at 52.  The SEC’s argument that <em>Granfinanciera</em> does not apply because the Government is the party bringing this action also fails.  What matters is the substance of the suit, not where it is brought, who brings it, or how it is labeled.  <em>Northern Pipeline Constr. Co.</em>, 458 U.&nbsp;S., at 69 n. 23 (plurality opinion).  Pp.&nbsp;21–22.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\">  (5)&nbsp;The Court’s opinion in <em>Atlas Roofing Co.</em> v. <em>Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm’n</em>, <a aria-label=\"430 U. S. 442\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/430/442\">430 U.&nbsp;S. 442</a>, is not to the contrary.  The litigation in that case arose under the Occupational Health and Safety Act.  Facing agency enforcement actions, two employers alleged that the agency’s adjudicatory authority violated the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a>.  See <em>id.,</em> at 448–449.  The Court concluded that Congress could assign the OSH Act adjudications to an agency because the claims involved “a new cause of action, and remedies therefor, unknown to the common law.”  <em>Id.,</em> at 461.  The cases <em>Atlas Roofing</em> relied upon applied the “public rights” exception to actions that were “&nbsp;‘not .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. suit[s] at common law or in the nature of such .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. suit[s].’&nbsp;”  <em>Id.</em>, at 453.  <em>Atlas Roofing</em> therefore does not apply here, where the statutory claim is “&nbsp;‘in the nature of&nbsp;’&nbsp;” a common law suit.  <em>Id., </em>at 453.  Later rulings also foreclose reading <em>Atlas Roofing</em> as the SEC does<em>.</em>  This Court clarified in <em>Tull </em>that the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> does apply to novel statutory regimes, so long as the statutory claims are akin to common law claims.  See 481 U.&nbsp;S., at 421–423.  And the Court has explained that the public rights exception does not apply automatically whenever Congress assigns a matter to an agency for adjudication.

The SEC chose to adjudicate the matter in-house before one of its administrative law judges, rather than in federal court where respondents could have proceeded before a jury.  We consider whether the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> permits the SEC to compel respondents to defend themselves before the agency rather than before a jury in federal court.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">I</h3>\n<h4 class=\"jy-center\">A</h4>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> In the aftermath of the Wall Street Crash of 1929, Congress passed a suite of laws designed to combat securities fraud and increase market transparency.  Three such statues are relevant here: The Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  <a href=\"/rio/citation/48_Stat._74\">48 Stat. 74</a>, <a aria-label=\"15 USC 77a\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/77a\">15 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §§77a</a> <em>et&nbsp;seq</em>.; 48 Stat. &nbsp;881, 78a <em>et&nbsp;seq</em>.; <a href=\"/rio/citation/54_Stat._847\">54 Stat. 847</a>, 80b–1 <em>et seq</em>.  These Acts respectively govern the registration of securities, the trading of securities, and the activities of investment advisers.  Their protections are mutually reinforcing and often overlap.  See <em>Lorenzo</em> v. <em>SEC</em>, <a aria-label=\"587 U. S. 71\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/587/71\">587 U.&nbsp;S. 71</a>, 80 (2019).  Although each regulates different aspects of the securities markets, their pertinent provisions—collectively referred to by regulators as “the antifraud provisions,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 73a, 202a—target the same basic behavior: misrepresenting or concealing material facts.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The three antifraud provisions are Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act, and Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act.  Section 17(a) prohibits regulated individuals from “obtain[ing] money or property by means of any untrue statement of a material fact,” as well as causing certain omissions of material fact.  <a aria-label=\"15 USC 77q a 2\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/77q#a_2\">15 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §77q(a)(2)</a>.  As implemented by Rule 10b–5, Section 10(b) prohibits using “any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud,” making “untrue statement[s] of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. material fact,” causing certain material omissions, and “engag[ing] in any act .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. which operates or would operate as a fraud.”  <a aria-label=\"17 CFR\" href=\"/cfr/text/17\">17</a> CFR §240.10b–5 (2023); see <a aria-label=\"15 USC 78j b\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/78j#b\">15 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §78j(b)</a>.  And finally, Section 206(b), as implemented by Rule 206(4)–8, prohibits investment advisers from making “any untrue statement of a material fact” or engaging in “fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative” acts with respect to investors or prospective investors.  <a aria-label=\"17 CFR\" href=\"/cfr/text/17\">17</a> CFR §§275.206(4)–8(a)(1), (2); see <a aria-label=\"15 USC 80b 6 4\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/80b–6#4\">15 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §80b–6(4)</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> To enforce these Acts, Congress created the SEC.  The SEC may bring an enforcement action in one of two forums.  First, the Commission can adjudicate the matter itself.  See §§77h–1, 78u–2, 78u–3, 80b–3.  Alternatively, it can file a suit in federal court.  See §§77t, 78u, 80b–9.  The SEC’s choice of forum dictates two aspects of the litigation: The procedural protections enjoyed by the defendant, and the remedies available to the SEC.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; Procedurally, these forums differ in who presides and makes legal determinations, what evidentiary and discovery rules apply, and who finds facts.  Most pertinently, in federal court a jury finds the facts, depending on the nature of the claim.  See U.&nbsp;S. Const., Amdt. 7.  In addition, a life-tenured, salary-protected Article III judge presides, see Art.&nbsp;III, §1, and the litigation is governed by the Federal Rules of Evidence and the ordinary rules of discovery.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Conversely, when the SEC adjudicates the matter in-house, there are no juries.  Instead, the Commission presides and finds facts while its Division of Enforcement prosecutes the case.  The Commission may also delegate its role as judge and factfinder to one of its members or to an administrative law judge (ALJ) that it employs.  See <a aria-label=\"15 USC 78d 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/78d–1\">15 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §78d–1</a>.  In these proceedings, the Commission or its delegee decides discovery disputes, see, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <a aria-label=\"17 CFR\" href=\"/cfr/text/17\">17</a> CFR §201.232(b), and the SEC’s Rules of Practice govern, see <a aria-label=\"17 CFR\" href=\"/cfr/text/17\">17</a> CFR §201.100 <em>et&nbsp;seq</em>.  The Commission or its delegee also determines the scope and form of permissible evidence and may admit hearsay and other testimony that would be inadmissible in federal court.  See §§201.320, 201.326.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> When a Commission member or an ALJ presides, the full Commission can review that official’s findings and conclusions, but it is not obligated to do so.  See §201.360; <a aria-label=\"15 USC 78d 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/78d–1\">15 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §78d–1</a>.  Judicial review is also available once the proceedings have concluded.  See §§77i(a), 78y(a)(1), 80b–13(a).  But such review is deferential.  By law, a reviewing court must treat the agency’s factual findings as “conclusive” if sufficiently supported by the record, <em>e.g.</em>, §78y(a)(4); see<em> Richardson</em> v. <em>Perales</em>, <a aria-label=\"402 U. S. 389\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/402/389\">402 U.&nbsp;S. 389</a>, 401 (1971), even when they rest on evidence that could not have been admitted in federal court.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The remedy at issue in this case, civil penalties, also originally depended upon the forum chosen by the SEC.  Except in cases against registered entities, the SEC could obtain civil penalties only in federal court.  See Insider Trading &nbsp;Sanctions Act of 1984, §2, <a href=\"/rio/citation/98_Stat._1264\">98 Stat. 1264</a>; Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990, §§101, 201–202, <a href=\"/rio/citation/104_Stat._932\">104 Stat. 932</a>–933, 935–938.  That is no longer so.  In 2010, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), <a href=\"/rio/citation/124_Stat._1376\">124 Stat. 1376</a>.  That Act “ma[de] the SEC’s authority in administrative penalty proceedings coextensive with its authority to seek penalties in Federal court.”  H. R. Rep. No. 111–687, p.&nbsp;78 (2010).  In other words, the SEC may now seek civil penalties in federal court, or it may impose them through its own in-house proceedings.  See Dodd-Frank Act, §929P(a), <a href=\"/rio/citation/124_Stat._1862\">124 Stat. 1862</a>–1864 (codified in relevant part as amended at <a aria-label=\"15 USC\" href=\"/uscode/text/15\">15</a> U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §§<a aria-label=\"15 USC 77h 1 g\" href=\"/uscode/text/15/77h-1#g\">77h–1(g)</a>, <a aria-label=\"15 USC 78u 2 a\" href=\"/uscode/text/15/78u-2#a\">78u–2(a)</a>, <a aria-label=\"15 USC 80b 3 i 1\" href=\"/uscode/text/15/80b-3#i_1\">80b–3(i)(1)</a>).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Civil penalties rank among the SEC’s most potent enforcement tools.  These penalties consist of fines of up to $725,000 per violation.  See §§77h–1(g), 78u–2, 80b–3(i).  And the SEC may levy these penalties even when no investor has actually suffered financial loss.  See <em>SEC </em>v. <em>Blavin</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/760_F.2d_706\">760 F.&nbsp;2d 706</a>, 711 (CA6 1985) (<em>per&nbsp;curiam</em>).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Shortly after passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC began investigating Jarkesy and Patriot28 for securities fraud.  Between 2007 and 2010, Jarkesy launched two investment funds, raising about $24 million from 120 “accredited” investors—a class of investors that includes, for example, financial institutions, certain investment professionals, and high net worth individuals.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 72a–73a, 110a, n.&nbsp;72; see <a aria-label=\"17 CFR\" href=\"/cfr/text/17\">17</a> CFR §230.501.  Patriot28, which Jarkesy managed, served as the funds’ investment adviser.  According to the SEC, Jarkesy and Patriot28 misled investors in at least three ways: (1) by misrepresenting the investment strategies that Jarkesy and Patriot28 employed, (2) by lying about the identity of the funds’ auditor and prime broker, and (3) by inflating the funds’ claimed value &nbsp;so that Jarkesy and Patriot28 could collect larger management fees.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 80a–86a, 95a–105a.  The SEC initiated an enforcement action, contending that these actions violated the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act, and the Investment Advisers Act, and sought civil penalties and other remedies.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Relying on the new authority conferred by the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC opted to adjudicate the matter itself rather than in federal court.  In 2014, the presiding ALJ issued an initial decision.  <em>Id</em>., at 155a–225a. <em> </em>The SEC reviewed the decision and then released its final order in 2020.  <em>Id</em>., at 71a–154a.  The final order levied a civil penalty of $300,000 against Jarkesy and Patriot28, directed them to cease and desist committing or causing violations of the antifraud provisions, ordered Patriot28 to disgorge earnings, and prohibited Jarkesy from participating in the securities industry and in offerings of penny stocks.  <em>Id</em>., at 152a–154a.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Jarkesy and Patriot28 petitioned for judicial review.  34 F.&nbsp;4th 446, 450 (CA5 2022). <em> </em>A divided panel of the Fifth Circuit granted their petition and vacated the final order.  <em>Id</em>., at 449–450.  Applying a two-part test from <em>Granfinanciera, S. A.</em> v. <em>Nordberg</em>, <a aria-label=\"492 U.S. 33\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/492/33\">492 U.&nbsp;S. 33 (1989)</a>, the panel held that the agency’s decision to adjudicate the matter in-house violated Jarkesy’s and Patriot28’s <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> right to a jury trial.  34 F. 4th, at 451.  First, the panel determined that because these SEC antifraud claims were “akin to [a] traditional action[&nbsp;] in debt,” a jury trial would be required if this case were brought in an Article III court.  <em>Id.</em>, at 454; see <em>id.</em>, at 453–455.  It then considered whether the “public rights” exception applied.  That exception permits Congress, under certain circumstances, to assign an action to an agency tribunal without a jury, consistent with the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a>.  See <em>id</em>., at 455–459.  The panel concluded that the exception did not apply, and that therefore the case should have been brought in federal court, &nbsp;where a jury could have found the facts pertinent to the defendants’ fraud liability.  Based on this <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> violation, the panel vacated the final order.  <em>Id</em>., at 459.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> It also identified two further constitutional problems.  First, it determined that Congress had violated the nondelegation doctrine by authorizing the SEC, without adequate guidance, to choose whether to litigate this action in an Article III court or to adjudicate the matter itself.  See <em>id</em>., at 459–463.  The panel also found that the insulation of the SEC ALJs from executive supervision with two layers of for-cause removal protections violated the separation of powers. <em> </em>See <em>id</em>., at 463–466. <em> </em>Judge Davis dissented.  <em>Id</em>., at 466–479.  The Fifth Circuit denied rehearing en banc, 51 F.&nbsp;4th 644 (2022), and we granted certiorari, 600 U.&nbsp;S. ___ (2023).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">II</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> This case poses a straightforward question: whether the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> entitles a defendant to a jury trial when the SEC seeks civil penalties against him for securities fraud.  Our analysis of this question follows the approach set forth in <em>Granfinanciera</em> and <em>Tull</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"481 U.S. 412\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/481/412\">481 U.&nbsp;S. 412 (1987)</a>.  The threshold issue is whether this action implicates the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a>.  It does.  The SEC’s antifraud provisions replicate common law fraud, and it is well established that common law claims must be heard by a jury.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Since this case does implicate the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a>, we next consider whether the “public rights” exception to Article III jurisdiction applies.  This exception has been held to permit Congress to assign certain matters to agencies for adjudication even though such proceedings would not afford the right to a jury trial.  The exception does not apply here because the present action does not fall within &nbsp;any of the distinctive areas involving governmental prerogatives where the Court has concluded that a matter may be resolved outside of an Article III court, without a jury.  The <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> therefore applies and a jury is required.  Since the answer to the jury trial question resolves this case, we do not reach the nondelegation or removal issues.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">A</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> We first explain why this action implicates the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">1</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The right to trial by jury is “of such importance and occupies so firm a place in our history and jurisprudence that any seeming curtailment of the right” has always been and “should be scrutinized with the utmost care.”  <em>Dimick</em> v. <em>Schiedt</em>, <a aria-label=\"293 U. S. 474\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/293/474\">293 U.&nbsp;S. 474</a>, 486 (1935).  Commentators recognized the right as “the glory of the English law,” 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 379 (8th ed. 1778) (Blackstone), and it was prized by the American colonists.  When the English began evading American juries by siphoning adjudications to juryless admiralty, vice admiralty, and chancery courts, Americans condemned Parliament for “subvert[ing] the rights and liberties of the colonists.”  Resolutions of the Stamp Act Congress, Art.&nbsp;VIII (Oct. 19, 1765), reprinted in Sources of Our Liberties 270, 271 (R. Perry &amp; J. Cooper eds. 1959).  Representatives gathered at the First Continental Congress demanded that Parliament respect the “great and inestimable privilege of being tried by their peers of the vicinage, according to the [common] law.”  1 Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774–1789, p. 69 (Oct. 14, 1774) (W. Ford ed. 1904). <em> </em>And when the English continued to try Americans without juries, the Founders cited the practice as a justification for &nbsp;severing our ties to England.  See Declaration of Independence ¶20; see generally <em>Erlinger </em>v. <em>United States</em>, 602 U.&nbsp;S. ___, ___–___ (2024).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In the Revolution’s aftermath, perhaps the “most success[ful]” critique leveled against the proposed Constitution was its “want of a .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. provision for the trial by jury in civil cases.”  The Federalist No. 83, p. 495 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton) (emphasis deleted).  The Framers promptly adopted the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> to fix that flaw.  In so doing, they “embedded” the right in the Constitution, securing it “against the passing demands of expediency or convenience.”  <em>Reid</em> v. <em>Covert</em>, <a aria-label=\"354 U. S. 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/354/1\">354 U.&nbsp;S. 1</a>, 10 (1957) (plurality opinion).  Since then, “every encroachment upon it has been watched with great jealousy.”  <em>Parsons</em> v. <em>Bedford</em>, 3 Pet. 433, 446 (1830).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">2</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> By its text, the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> guarantees that in “[s]uits at common law, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the right of trial by jury shall be preserved.”  In construing this language, we have noted that the right is not limited to the “common-law forms of action recognized” when the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> was ratified.  <em>Curtis</em> v. <em>Loether</em>, <a aria-label=\"415 U. S. 189\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/415/189\">415 U.&nbsp;S. 189</a>, 193 (1974).  As Justice Story explained, the Framers used the term “common law” in the Amendment “in contradistinction to equity, and admiralty, and maritime jurisprudence.”  <em>Parsons</em>, 3 Pet., at 446.  The Amendment therefore “embrace[s] all suits which are not of equity or admiralty jurisdiction, whatever may be the peculiar form which they may assume.”  <em>Id</em>., at 447.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> extends to a particular statutory claim if the claim is “legal in nature.”  <em>Granfinanciera</em>,<em> </em>492 U.&nbsp;S., at 53.  As we made clear in <em>Tull</em>, whether that claim is statutory is immaterial to this analysis.  See 481 U.&nbsp;S., at 414–415, 417–425.  In that case, the Government sued a real estate developer for civil penalties in federal &nbsp;court.  The developer responded by invoking his right to a jury trial.  Although the cause of action arose under the Clean Water Act, the Court surveyed early cases to show that the statutory nature of the claim was not legally relevant.  “Actions by the Government to recover civil penalties under statutory provisions,” we explained, “historically ha[d] been viewed as [a] type of action in debt requiring trial by jury.”  <em>Id</em>., at 418–419.  To determine whether a suit is legal in nature, we directed courts to consider the cause of action and the remedy it provides.  Since some causes of action sound in both law and equity, we concluded that the remedy was the “more important” consideration.  <em>Id.</em>, at 421 (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted); see <em>id</em>., at 418–421.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In this case, the remedy is all but dispositive.  For respondents’ alleged fraud, the SEC seeks civil penalties, a form of monetary relief.  While monetary relief can be legal or equitable, money damages are the prototypical common law remedy.  See <em>Mertens</em> v. <em>Hewitt Associates</em>, <a aria-label=\"508 U. S. 248\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/508/248\">508 U.&nbsp;S. 248</a>, 255 (1993).  What determines whether a monetary remedy is legal is if it is designed to punish or deter the wrongdoer, or, on the other hand, solely to “restore the status quo.”  <em>Tull</em>, 481 U.&nbsp;S., at 422.  As we have previously explained, “a civil sanction that cannot fairly be said solely to serve a remedial purpose, but rather can only be explained as also serving either retributive or deterrent purposes, is punishment.”  <em>Austin</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"509 U. S. 602\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/509/602\">509 U.&nbsp;S. 602</a>, 610 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted).  And while courts of equity could order a defendant to return unjustly obtained funds, only courts of law issued monetary penalties to “punish culpable individuals.”  <em>Tull</em>, 481 U.&nbsp;S., at 422.  Applying these principles, we have recognized that “civil penalt[ies are] a type of remedy at common law that could only be enforced in courts of law.”  <em>Ibid</em>.  The same is true here.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> To start, the Securities Exchange Act and the Investment &nbsp;Advisers Act condition the availability of civil penalties on six statutory factors: (1) whether the alleged misconduct involved fraud, deceit, manipulation, or deliberate or reckless disregard for regulatory requirements, (2) whether it caused harm, (3) whether it resulted in unjust enrichment, accounting for any restitution made, (4) whether the defendant had previously violated securities laws or regulations, or had previously committed certain crimes, (5) the need for deterrence, and (6) other “matters as justice may require.”  §§78u–2(c), 80b–3(i)(3).  Of these, several concern culpability, deterrence, and recidivism.  Because they tie the availability of civil penalties to the perceived need to punish the defendant rather than to restore the victim, such considerations are legal rather than equitable.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The same is true of the criteria that determine the size of the available remedy.  The Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act, and the Investment Advisers Act establish three “tiers” of civil penalties.  See §§77h–1(g)(2), 78u–2(b), 80b–3(i)(2).  Violating a federal securities law or regulation exposes a defendant to a first tier penalty.  A second tier penalty may be ordered if the violation involved fraud, deceit, manipulation, or deliberate or reckless disregard for regulatory requirements.  Finally, if those acts also resulted in substantial gains to the defendant or losses to another, or created a “significant risk” of the latter, the defendant is subject to a third tier penalty.  Each successive tier authorizes a larger monetary sanction.  See <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Like the considerations that determine the availability of civil penalties in the first place, the criteria that divide these tiers are also legal in nature.  Each tier conditions the available penalty on the culpability of the defendant and the need for deterrence, not the size of the harm that must be remedied.  Indeed, showing that a victim suffered harm is not even required to advance a defendant from one tier to the next.  Since nothing in this analysis turns on “restor[ing] the status quo,” <em>Tull</em>, 481 U.&nbsp;S., at 422,<em> </em>these factors &nbsp;show that these civil penalties are designed to be punitive.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The final proof that this remedy is punitive is that the SEC is not obligated to return any money to victims.  See <em>id</em>., at 422–423.  Although the SEC can choose to compensate injured shareholders from the civil penalties it collects, see <a aria-label=\"15 USC 7246 a\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/7246#a\">15 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §7246(a)</a>, it admits that it is not required to do so, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 124a, n.&nbsp;116 (citing <a aria-label=\"17 CFR\" href=\"/cfr/text/17\">17</a> CFR §201.1100).  Such a penalty by definition does not “restore the status quo” and can make no pretense of being equitable. <em> Tull</em>,<em> </em>481 U.&nbsp;S., at 422.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In sum, the civil penalties in this case are designed to punish and deter, not to compensate.  They are therefore “a type of remedy at common law that could only be enforced in courts of law.”  <em>Ibid</em>.  That conclusion effectively decides that this suit implicates the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> right, and that a defendant would be entitled to a jury on these claims.  See <em>id</em>., at 421–423.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The close relationship between the causes of action in this case and common law fraud confirms that conclusion.  Both target the same basic conduct: misrepresenting or concealing material facts.  Compare <a aria-label=\"15 USC\" href=\"/uscode/text/15\">15</a> U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §§<a aria-label=\"15 USC 77q a 2\" href=\"/uscode/text/15/77q#a_2\">77q(a)(2)</a>, <a aria-label=\"15 USC 78j b\" href=\"/uscode/text/15/78j#b\">78j(b)</a>, <a aria-label=\"15 USC 80b 6 4\" href=\"/uscode/text/15/80b-6#4\">80b–6(4)</a>; <a aria-label=\"17 CFR\" href=\"/cfr/text/17\">17</a> CFR §§240.10b–5(b), 275.206(4)–8(a)(1), with Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Economic Harm, §§9, 13 (2018); see also, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Pauwels</em> v. <em>Deloitte LLP</em>, 83 F.&nbsp;4th 171, 189–190 (CA2 2023) (identifying the elements of common law fraud under New York law); <em>Conroy</em> v. <em>Regents of Univ. of Cal.</em>, 45 Cal. 4th 1244, 1254–1255, 203 P.&nbsp;3d 1127, 1135 (2009) (same for California law); <em>Wesdem, L.L.C.</em> v. <em>Illinois Tool Works, Inc.</em>, 70 F.&nbsp;4th 285, 291 (CA5 2023) (same for Texas law).  That is no accident.  Congress deliberately used “fraud” and other common law terms of art in the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act, and the Investment Advisers Act.  <em>E</em>.<em>g</em>., <a aria-label=\"15 USC 77q a 3\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/77q#a_3\">15 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §77q(a)(3)</a> (prohibiting any practice “which operates .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as a fraud”).  In so doing, Congress incorporated prohibitions from common law fraud into federal securities law.  The SEC has followed &nbsp;suit in rulemakings.  Rule 10b–5, for example, prohibits “any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud,” and “engag[ing] in any act .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. which operates or would operate as a fraud.”  <a aria-label=\"17 CFR\" href=\"/cfr/text/17\">17</a> CFR §§240.10b–5(a), (c).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Congress’s decision to draw upon common law fraud created an enduring link between federal securities fraud and its common law “ancestor.”  <em>Foster</em> v. <em>Wilson</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/504_F.3d_1046\">504 F. 3d 1046</a>, 1050 (CA9 2007).  “[W]hen Congress transplants a common-law term, the old soil comes with it.”  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Hansen</em>, <a aria-label=\"599 U. S. 762\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/599/762\">599 U.&nbsp;S. 762</a>, 778 (2023) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Our precedents therefore often consider common law fraud principles when interpreting federal securities law.  <em>E</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</em> v. <em>Broudo</em>, <a aria-label=\"544 U. S. 336\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/544/336\">544 U.&nbsp;S. 336</a>, 343–344 (2005) (evaluating pleading requirements in light of the “common-law roots of the securities fraud action”); <em>Schreiber</em> v. <em>Burlington Northern, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"472 U. S. 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/472/1\">472 U.&nbsp;S. 1</a>, 7 (1985) (“The meaning the Court has given the term ‘manipulative’ [in §10b of the Securities Exchange Act] is consistent with the use of the term at common law .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” (footnote omitted)); <em>Chiarella</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"445 U. S. 222\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/445/222\">445 U.&nbsp;S. 222</a>, 227–229 (1980) (explaining that insider trading liability under Rule 10b–5 is rooted in the common law duty of disclosure); <em>Basic Inc.</em> v. <em>Levinson</em>, <a aria-label=\"485 U. S. 224\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/485/224\">485 U.&nbsp;S. 224</a>, 253 (1988) (White, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (“In general, the case law developed in this Court with respect to §10(b) and Rule 10b–5 has been based on doctrines with which we, as judges, are familiar: common-law doctrines of fraud and deceit.”).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> That is not to say that federal securities fraud and common law fraud are identical.  In some respects, federal securities fraud is narrower.  For example, federal securities law does not “convert every common-law fraud that happens to involve securities into a violation.”  <em>SEC</em> v. <em>Zandford</em>, <a aria-label=\"535 U. S. 813\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/535/813\">535 U.&nbsp;S. 813</a>, 820 (2002).  It only targets certain subject matter and certain disclosures.  In other respects, &nbsp;federal securities fraud is broader.  For example, federal securities fraud employs the burden of proof typical in civil cases, while its common law analogue traditionally used a more stringent standard.  See <em>Herman &amp; MacLean</em> v. <em>Huddleston</em>, <a aria-label=\"459 U. S. 375\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/459/375\">459 U.&nbsp;S. 375</a>, 387–390 (1983).  Courts have also not typically interpreted federal securities fraud to require a showing of harm to be actionable by the SEC.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Blavin</em>, <a aria-label=\"760 F.2d 711\" href=\"/rio/citation/760_F.2d_711\">760 F. 2d, at 711</a>; <em>SEC</em> v. <em>Life Partners Holdings, Inc.</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/854_F.3d_765\">854 F. 3d 765</a>, 779 (CA5 2017).  Nevertheless, the close relationship between federal securities fraud and common law fraud confirms that this action is “legal in nature.”  <em>Granfinanciera</em>,<em> </em>492 U.&nbsp;S., at 53.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<h4 class=\"jy-center\">1</h4>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Although the claims at issue here implicate the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a>, the Government and the dissent argue that a jury trial is not required because the “public rights” exception applies.  Under this exception, Congress may assign the matter for decision to an agency without a jury, consistent with the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a>.  But this case does not fall within the exception, so Congress may not avoid a jury trial by preventing the case from being heard before an Article III tribunal.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Constitution prohibits Congress from “withdraw[ing] from judicial cognizance any matter which, from its nature, is the subject of a suit at the common law.”  <em>Murray’s Lessee</em> v. <em>Hoboken Land &amp; Improvement Co.</em>, 18 How. 272, 284 (1856).  Once such a suit “is brought within the bounds of federal jurisdiction,” an Article III court must decide it, with a jury if the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> applies.  <em>Stern</em> v. <em>Marshall</em>, <a aria-label=\"564 U. S. 462\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/564/462\">564 U.&nbsp;S. 462</a>, 484 (2011).  These propositions are critical to maintaining the proper role of the Judiciary in the Constitution: “Under ‘the basic concept of separation of powers .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that flow[s] from the scheme of a tripartite government’ adopted in the Constitution, ‘the judicial Power of &nbsp;the United States’&nbsp;” cannot be shared with the other branches.  <em>Id</em>., at 483 (quoting <em>United States</em> v. <em>Nixon</em>, <a aria-label=\"418 U. S. 683\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/418/683\">418 U.&nbsp;S. 683</a>, 704 (1974); alteration in original).  Or, as Alexander Hamilton wrote in The Federalist Papers, “&nbsp;‘there is no liberty if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers.’&nbsp;”  The Federalist No. 78, at 466 (quoting 1 Montesquieu, The Spirit of Laws 181 (10th ed. 1773)).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> On that basis, we have repeatedly explained that matters concerning private rights may not be removed from Article III courts.  <em>Murray’s Lessee</em>, 18 How., at 284; <em>Granfinanciera</em>,<em> </em>492 U.&nbsp;S., at 51–52; <em>Stern</em>,<em> </em>564 U.&nbsp;S., at 484.  A hallmark that we have looked to in determining if a suit concerns private rights is whether it “is made of ‘the stuff of the traditional actions at common law tried by the courts at Westminster in 1789.’&nbsp;”  <em>Id.</em>, at 484 (quoting <em>Northern Pipeline Constr. Co.</em> v. <em>Marathon Pipe Line Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"458 U. S. 50\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/458/50\">458 U.&nbsp;S. 50</a>, 90 (1982) (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment)).  If a suit is in the nature of an action at common law, then the matter presumptively concerns private rights, and adjudication by an Article III court is mandatory.  <em>Stern</em>, 564 U.&nbsp;S., at 484.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> At the same time, our precedent has also recognized a class of cases concerning what we have called “public rights.”  Such matters “historically could have been determined exclusively by [the executive and legislative] branches,” <em>id.</em>, at 493 (internal quotation marks omitted), even when they were “presented in such form that the judicial power [wa]s capable of acting on them,” <em>Murray’s Lessee</em>,<em> </em>18 How., at 284.  In contrast to common law claims, no involvement by an Article III court in the initial adjudication is necessary in such a case.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The decision that first recognized the public rights exception was<em> Murray’s Lessee</em>.  In that case, a federal customs collector failed to deliver public funds to the Treasury, so the Government issued a “warrant of distress” to compel him to produce the withheld sum.  18 How., at 274–275.  &nbsp;Pursuant to the warrant, the Government eventually seized and sold a plot of the collector’s land.  <em>Id.</em>, at 274. <em> </em>Plaintiffs later attacked the purchaser’s title, arguing that the initial seizure was void because the Government had audited the collector’s account and issued the warrant itself without judicial involvement.  <em>Id</em>., at 275.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Court upheld the sale.  It explained that pursuant to its power to collect revenue, the Government could rely on “summary proceedings” to compel its officers to “pay such balances of the public money” into the Treasury “as may be in their hands.”  <em>Id</em>., at 281, 285.  Indeed, the Court observed, there was an unbroken tradition—long predating the founding—of using these kinds of proceedings to “enforce payment of balances due from receivers of the revenue.”  <em>Id</em>., at 278; see <em>id</em>., at 281.  In light of this historical practice, the Government could issue a valid warrant without intruding on the domain of the Judiciary.  See <em>id</em>., at 280–282.  The challenge to the sale thus lacked merit.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This principle extends beyond cases involving the collection of revenue.  In <em>Oceanic Steam Navigation Co. </em>v. <em>Stranahan</em>, <a aria-label=\"214 U.S. 320\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/214/320\">214 U.&nbsp;S. 320 (1909)</a>, we considered the imposition of a monetary penalty on a steamship company.  Pursuant to its plenary power over immigration, Congress had excluded immigration by aliens afflicted with “loathsome or dangerous contagious diseases,” and it authorized customs collectors to enforce the prohibition with fines.  <em>Id</em>., at 331–334.  When a steamship company challenged the penalty under Article III, we upheld it.  Congress’s power over foreign commerce, we explained, was so total that no party had a “&nbsp;‘vested right’&nbsp;” to import anything into the country. <em> Id</em>., at 335 (quoting <em>Buttfield</em> v. <em>Stranahan</em>, <a aria-label=\"192 U. S. 470\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/192/470\">192 U.&nbsp;S. 470</a>, 493 (1904)).  By the same token, Congress could also prohibit immigration by certain classes of persons and enforce those prohibitions with administrative penalties assessed without a jury.  See <em>Oceanic Steam Navigation Co.</em>, 214 U.&nbsp;S., at<em> </em>&nbsp;339–340.<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Roberts Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-1\" id=\"OPINION_4-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In <em>Ex parte Bakelite Corp</em>., we upheld a law authorizing the President to impose tariffs on goods imported by “unfair methods of competition.”  <a aria-label=\"279 U. S. 438\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/279/438\">279 U.&nbsp;S. 438</a>, 446 (1929).  The law permitted him to set whatever tariff was necessary, subject to a statutory cap, to produce fair competition.  If the President was “satisfied the unfairness [was] extreme,” the law even authorized him to “exclude[&nbsp;]” foreign goods entirely.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Because the political branches had traditionally held exclusive power over this field and had exercised &nbsp;it, we explained that the assessment of tariffs did not implicate Article III.  <em>Id</em>., at 458, 460–461.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This Court has since held that certain other historic categories of adjudications fall within the exception, including relations with Indian tribes, see <em>United States</em> v. <em>Jicarilla Apache Nation</em>, <a aria-label=\"564 U. S. 162\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/564/162\">564 U.&nbsp;S. 162</a>, 174 (2011), the administration of public lands, <em>Crowell</em> v. <em>Benson</em>, <a aria-label=\"285 U.

This is an “area of frequently arcane distinctions and confusing precedents.”  <em>Thomas</em> v. <em>Union Carbide Agricultural Products Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"473 U.

The Court “has not ‘definitively explained’ the distinction between public and private rights,” and we do not claim to do so today.  <em>Oil States Energy Services, LLC</em> v. <em>Greene’s Energy Group, LLC</em>, <a aria-label=\"584 U. S. 325\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/584/325\">584 U. S. 325</a>, 334 (2018).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Nevertheless, since <em>Murray’s Lessee</em>, this Court has typically evaluated the legal basis for the assertion of the doctrine with care.  The public rights exception is, after all, an <em>exception</em>.  It has no textual basis in the Constitution and must therefore derive instead from background legal principles.  <em>Murray’s Lessee </em>itself, for example, took pains to justify the application of the exception in that particular instance by explaining that it flowed from centuries-old rules concerning revenue collection by a sovereign.  See 18 How., at 281–285.  Without such close attention to the basis for each asserted application of the doctrine, the exception would swallow the rule.<a aria-label=\"reference 2 of Roberts Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-2\" id=\"OPINION_4-2ref\"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; From the beginning we have emphasized one point: “To avoid misconstruction upon so grave a subject, we think it proper to state that we do not consider congress can .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. withdraw from judicial cognizance any matter which, from its nature, is the subject of a suit at the common law, or in equity, or admiralty.”  <em>Murray’s Lessee</em>, 18 How., at 284.  We have never embraced the proposition that “practical” considerations alone can justify extending the scope of the public rights exception to such matters.  <em>Stern</em>, 564 U.&nbsp;S., at 501.  “[E]ven with respect to matters that arguably fall within the scope of the ‘public rights’ doctrine, the presumption is in favor of Article III courts.”  <em>Northern Pipeline Constr. Co.</em>, 458 U.&nbsp;S., at 69, n.&nbsp;23 (plurality opinion) (citing <em>Glidden Co.</em> v. <em>Zdanok</em>, <a aria-label=\"370 U. S. 530\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/370/530\">370 U.&nbsp;S. 530</a>, 548–549, and n.&nbsp;21 (1962) (plurality opinion)).  And for good reason: “Article III could neither serve its purpose in the system of checks and balances nor preserve the integrity of judicial decisionmaking if the other branches of the Federal Government could confer the Government’s ‘judicial Power’ on entities outside &nbsp;Article III.”  <em>Stern</em>, 564 U.&nbsp;S.,<em> </em>at 484.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">2</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> This is not the first time we have considered whether the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> guarantees the right to a jury trial “in the face of Congress’ decision to allow a non-Article III tribunal to adjudicate” a statutory “fraud claim.”  492 U.&nbsp;S., at 37, 50.  We did so in <em>Granfinanciera</em>, and the principles identified in that case largely resolve this one.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Granfinanciera</em> involved a statutory action for fraudulent conveyance.  As codified in the Bankruptcy Code, the claim permitted a trustee to void a transfer or obligation made by the debtor before bankruptcy if the debtor “received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for such transfer or obligation.”  <a aria-label=\"11 USC 548 a 2 A\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/548#a_2_A\">11 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §548(a)(2)(A)</a> (1982 ed., Supp. V).  Actions for fraudulent conveyance were well known at common law.  492 U.&nbsp;S., at 43.  Even when Congress added these claims to the Bankruptcy Code in 1978, see <a href=\"/rio/citation/92_Stat._2600\">92 Stat. 2600</a>, it preserved parties’ rights to a trial by jury, 492 U.&nbsp;S., at 49–50.  In 1984, however, Congress designated fraudulent conveyance actions “core [bankruptcy] proceedings” and authorized non-Article III bankruptcy judges to hear them without juries.  <em>Id</em>., at 50.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The issue in <em>Granfinanciera </em>was whether this designation was permissible under the public rights exception.  <em>Ibid</em>.  We explained that it was not.  Although Congress had assigned fraudulent conveyance claims to bankruptcy courts, that assignment was not dispositive.  See <em>id</em>., at 52.  What mattered, we explained, was the substance of the suit.  “[T]raditional legal claims” must be decided by courts, “whether they originate in a newly fashioned regulatory scheme or possess a long line of common-law forebears.”  <em>Ibid.</em>  To determine whether the claim implicated the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a>, the Court applied the principles distilled in <em>Tull</em>.  We examined whether the matter was “from [its] nature subject to ‘a suit at common law.’&nbsp;”  492 U.&nbsp;S., at 56 &nbsp;(some internal quotation marks omitted); see <em>id</em>., at 43–50.  A survey of English cases showed that “actions to recover .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fraudulent transfers were often brought at law in late 18th-century England.”  <em>Id</em>., at 43.  The remedy the trustee sought was also one “traditionally provided by law courts.”  <em>Id</em>., at 49.  Fraudulent conveyance actions were thus “quintessentially suits at common law.”  <em>Id</em>., at 56.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> We also considered whether these actions were “closely intertwined” with the bankruptcy regime.  <em>Id.</em>, at 54.  Some bankruptcy claims, such as “creditors’ hierarchically ordered claims to a pro rata share of the bankruptcy res,” <em>id.</em>, at 56, are highly interdependent and require coordination.  Resolving such claims fairly is only possible if they are all submitted at once to a single adjudicator.  Otherwise, parties with lower priority claims can rush to the courthouse to seek payment before higher priority claims exhaust the estate, and an orderly disposition of a bankruptcy is impossible.  Other claims, though, can be brought in standalone suits, because they are neither prioritized nor subordinated to related claims.  Since fraudulent conveyance actions fall into that latter category, we concluded that these actions were not “closely intertwined” with the bankruptcy process.  <em>Id</em>., at 54.  We also noted that Congress had already authorized jury trials for certain bankruptcy matters, demonstrating that jury trials were not generally “incompatible” with the overall regime.  <em>Id</em>., at 61–62 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> We accordingly concluded that fraudulent conveyance actions were akin to “suits at common law” and were not inseparable from the bankruptcy process.  <em>Id</em>., at 54, 56.  The public rights exception therefore did not apply, and a jury was required.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">3</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> <em>Granfinanciera</em> effectively decides this case.  Even when an action “originate[s] in a newly fashioned regulatory &nbsp;scheme,” what matters is the substance of the action, not where Congress has assigned it.  <em>Id</em>., at 52.  And in this case, the substance points in only one direction.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> According to the SEC, these are actions under the “antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws” for “fraudulent conduct.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. 72a–73a (opinion of the Commission).  They provide civil penalties, a punitive remedy that we have recognized “could only be enforced in courts of law.”  <em>Tull</em>, 481 U.&nbsp;S., at 422.  And they target the same basic conduct as common law fraud, employ the same terms of art, and operate pursuant to similar legal principles.  See <em>supra</em>, at 10–12.  In short, this action involves a “matter[&nbsp;] of private rather than public right.”  <em>Granfinanciera</em>, 492 U.&nbsp;S., at 56.  Therefore, “Congress may not ‘withdraw’&nbsp;” it “&nbsp;‘from judicial cognizance.’&nbsp;”  <em>Stern</em>,<em> </em>564 U.&nbsp;S., at 484 (quoting <em>Murray’s Lessee</em>, 18 How., at 284).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">4</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Notwithstanding <em>Granfinanciera</em>, the SEC contends the public rights exception still<em> </em>applies in this case because Congress created “new statutory obligations, impose[d] civil penalties for their violation, and then commit[ted] to an administrative agency the function of deciding whether a violation ha[d] in fact occurred.”  Brief for Petitioner 21 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The foregoing from <em>Granfinanciera </em>already does away with much of the SEC’s argument.  Congress cannot “conjure away the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> by mandating that traditional legal claims be .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. taken to an administrative tribunal.” <em> </em>492 U.&nbsp;S., at 52.  Nor does the fact that the SEC action “originate[d] in a newly fashioned regulatory scheme” permit Congress to siphon this action away from an Article III court.  <em>Ibid</em>.  The constructive fraud claim in <em>Granfinanciera </em>was also statutory, see <em>id.</em>, at 37, but we nevertheless explained that the public rights exception did not apply.  Again, if the action resembles a traditional legal &nbsp;claim, its statutory origins are not dispositive.  See <em>id</em>., at 52, 56.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The SEC’s sole remaining basis for distinguishing <em>Granfinanciera </em>is that the Government is the party prosecuting this action.  See Brief for Petitioner 26–28; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 25 (Principal Deputy Solicitor General) (the “critical distinction” in the public rights analysis is “enforcement by the executive”); <em>id.</em>, at<em> </em>26 (identifying as “the constitutionally relevant distinction” that “this is something that has been assigned to a federal agency to enforce”).  But we have never held that “the presence of the United States as a proper party to the proceeding is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sufficient” by itself to trigger the exception.  <em>Northern Pipeline Constr. Co.</em>, 458 U.&nbsp;S., at 69, n. 23 (plurality opinion).  Again, what matters is the substance of the suit, not where it is brought, who brings it, or how it is labeled.  See <em>ibid</em>.  The object of this SEC action is to regulate transactions between private individuals interacting in a pre-existing market.  To do so, the Government has created claims whose causes of action are modeled on common law fraud and that provide a type of remedy available only in law courts.  This is a common law suit in all but name.  And such suits typically must be adjudicated in Article III courts.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">5</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The principal case on which the SEC and the dissent rely is <em>Atlas Roofing Co.</em> v. <em>Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission</em>, <a aria-label=\"430 U.S. 442\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/430/442\">430 U.&nbsp;S. 442 (1977)</a>.  Because the public rights exception as construed in <em>Atlas Roofing</em> does not extend to these civil penalty suits for fraud, that case does not control.  And for that same reason, we need not reach the suggestion made by Jarkesy and Patriot28 that <em>Tull </em>and <em>Granfinanciera</em> effectively overruled <em>Atlas Roofing</em> to the extent that case construed the public rights exception to allow the adjudication of civil penalty suits in administrative &nbsp;tribunals.<a aria-label=\"reference 3 of Roberts Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-3\" id=\"OPINION_4-3ref\"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The litigation in <em>Atlas Roofing </em>arose under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act), a federal regulatory regime created to promote safe working conditions.  <em>Id.</em>, at 444–445.  The Act authorized the Secretary of Labor to promulgate safety regulations, and it empowered the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (OSHRC) to adjudicate alleged violations.  <em>Id</em>., at 445–446.  If a party violated the regulations, the agency could impose civil penalties.  <em>Id.</em>, at 446.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Unlike the claims in <em>Granfinanciera </em>and this action, the OSH Act did not borrow its cause of action from the common law.  Rather, it simply commanded that “[e]ach employer .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall comply with occupational safety and health standards promulgated under this chapter.”  <a href=\"/rio/citation/84_Stat._1593\">84 Stat. 1593</a>, <a aria-label=\"29 USC 654 a 2\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/654#a_2\">29 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §654(a)(2)</a> (1976 ed.).  These standards bring no common law soil with them.  Cf.<em> Hansen</em>, 599 U.&nbsp;S., at 778.  Rather than reiterate common law terms of art, they instead resembled a detailed building code.  For example, the OSH Act regulations directed that a ground trench wall of “Solid Rock, Shale, or Cemented Sand and Gravels” could be constructed at a 90 degree angle to the ground.  <a aria-label=\"29 CFR\" href=\"/cfr/text/29\">29</a> CFR §1926.652, Table P–1 (1976); see <em>Atlas Roofing</em>,<em> </em>430 U.&nbsp;S., at 447 (discussing Table P–1).  But a wall of “Compacted Angular Gravels” needed to be sloped at 63 degrees, and a wall of “Well Rounded Loose Sand” at 26 degrees.  §1926.652, Table P–1.  The purpose of this regime was not to enable the Federal Government to bring or adjudicate &nbsp;claims that traced their ancestry to the common law.  Rather, Congress stated that it intended the agency to “develop[&nbsp;] innovative methods, techniques, and approaches for dealing with occupational safety and health problems.”  <a aria-label=\"29 USC 651 b 5\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/651#b_5\">29 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §651(b)(5)</a> (1976 ed.).  In both concept and execution, the Act was self-consciously novel.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Facing enforcement actions, two employers alleged that the adjudicatory authority of the OSHRC violated the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a>.  See <em>Atlas Roofing</em>, 430 U.&nbsp;S., at 448–449.<em> </em>The Court rejected the challenge, concluding that “when Congress creates new statutory ‘public rights,’ it may assign their adjudication to an administrative agency with which a jury trial would be incompatible, without violating the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a>[&nbsp;].”  <em>Id.</em>, at 455.  As the Court explained, the case involved “a new cause of action, and remedies therefor, unknown to the common law.”  <em>Id</em>., at 461.  The <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a>, the Court concluded, was accordingly “no bar to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. enforcement outside the regular courts of law.”  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The cases that <em>Atlas Roofing </em>relied upon did not extend the public rights exception to “traditional legal claims.”  <em>Granfinanciera</em>,<em> </em>492 U.&nbsp;S., at 52.  Instead, they applied the exception to actions that were “&nbsp;‘not .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. suit[s] at common law or in the nature of such .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. suit[s].’&nbsp;”  <em>Atlas Roofing</em>, 430 U.&nbsp;S<em>.</em>, at 453 (quoting <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp.</em>, 301 U.&nbsp;S., at 48); see <em>Atlas Roofing</em>, 430 U.&nbsp;S., at 450–451 (discussing, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Murray’s Lessee</em>, <em>Ex&nbsp;parte Bakelite Corp.</em>,<em> Helvering </em>v. <em>Mitchell</em>, <a aria-label=\"303 U.S. 391\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/303/391\">303 U.&nbsp;S. 391 (1938)</a>, and <em>Oceanic Steam Navigation Co</em>.).  Indeed, the Court recognized that if a case did involve a common law action or its equivalent, a jury was required.  See 430 U.&nbsp;S., at 455 (“&nbsp;‘[W]here the action involves rights and remedies recognized at common law, it must preserve to parties their right to a jury trial.’&nbsp;” (quoting <em>Pernell</em> v. <em>Southall Realty</em>, <a aria-label=\"416 U. S. 363\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/416/363\">416 U.&nbsp;S. 363</a>, 383 (1974)); <em>Atlas Roofing</em>, 430 U.&nbsp;S., at 458–459 (jury required &nbsp;when “courts of law supplied a cause of action and an adequate remedy to the litigant”).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Atlas Roofing</em> concluded that Congress could assign the OSH Act adjudications to an agency because the claims were “unknown to the common law.”  430 U.&nbsp;S., at 461.  The case<em> </em>therefore does not control here, where the statutory claim is “&nbsp;‘in the nature of&nbsp;’&nbsp;” a common law suit.  <em>Id.</em>, at 453 (quoting <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin</em>, 301 U.&nbsp;S., at 48).  As we have explained, Jarkesy and Patriot28 were prosecuted for “fraudulent conduct,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 72a, and the pertinent statutory provisions derive from, and are interpreted in light of, their common law counterparts, see <a aria-label=\"15 USC\" href=\"/uscode/text/15\">15</a> U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §§<a aria-label=\"15 USC 77q a 2\" href=\"/uscode/text/15/77q#a_2\">77q(a)(2)</a>, <a aria-label=\"15 USC 78j b\" href=\"/uscode/text/15/78j#b\">78j(b)</a>, <a aria-label=\"15 USC 80b 6 4\" href=\"/uscode/text/15/80b-6#4\">80b–6(4)</a>; <a aria-label=\"17 CFR\" href=\"/cfr/text/17\">17</a> CFR §§240.10b–5(b), 275.206(4)–8(a)(1); <em>Basic Inc.</em>, 485 U.&nbsp;S., at 253 (opinion of White, J.).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The reasoning of <em>Atlas Roofing</em> cannot support any broader rule.  The dissent chants “<em>Atlas Roofing</em>”<em> </em>like a mantra, but no matter how many times it repeats those words, it cannot give <em>Atlas Roofing </em>substance that it lacks.<a aria-label=\"reference 4 of Roberts Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-4\" id=\"OPINION_4-4ref\"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup></a>  &nbsp;Even as <em>Atlas Roofing</em> invoked the public rights exception, the definition it offered of the exception was circular.  The exception applied, the Court said, “in cases in which ‘public rights’ are being litigated—<em>e.&nbsp;g.</em>, cases in which the Government sues in its sovereign capacity to enforce public rights created by statutes.”  430 U.&nbsp;S., at 450; see <em>id.</em>, at 458.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> After <em>Atlas Roofing</em>, this Court clarified in <em>Tull </em>that the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> does apply to novel statutory regimes, so long as the claims are akin to common law claims.  See 481 U.&nbsp;S., at 421–423.  In addition, we have explained that the public rights exception does not apply automatically whenever Congress assigns a matter to an agency for adjudication.  See <em>Granfinanciera</em>, 492 U.&nbsp;S., at 52.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> For its part, the dissent also seems to suggest that <em>Atlas Roofing </em>establishes that the public rights exception applies whenever a statute increases governmental efficiency.  <em>Post</em>, at 15 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Sotomayor</span>, J.). <em> </em>Again, our precedents foreclose this argument.  As <em>Stern</em> explained, effects like increasing efficiency and reducing public costs are not enough to trigger the exception.  See<em> </em>564 U.&nbsp;S., at 501; <em>INS</em> v. <em>Chadha</em>, <a aria-label=\"462 U. S. 919\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/462/919\">462 U.&nbsp;S. 919</a>, 944 (1983).  Otherwise, evading &nbsp;the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> would become nothing more than a game, where the Government need only identify some slight advantage to the public from agency adjudication to strip its target of the protections of the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The novel claims in <em>Atlas Roofing</em> had never been brought in an Article III court.  By contrast, law courts have dealt with fraud actions since before the founding, and Congress had authorized the SEC to bring such actions in Article III courts and still authorizes the SEC to do so today.  See 3 Blackstone 41–42; §§77t, 78u, 80b–9.  Given the judiciary’s long history of handling fraud claims, it cannot be argued that the courts lack the capacity needed to adjudicate such actions.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In short, <em>Atlas Roofing </em>does not conflict with our conclusion.  When a matter “from its nature, is the subject of a suit at the common law,” Congress may not “withdraw [it] from judicial cognizance.”  <em>Murray’s Lessee</em>, 18 How., at 284.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">*  *  *</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> A defendant facing a fraud suit has the right to be tried by a jury of his peers before a neutral adjudicator.  Rather than recognize that right, the dissent would permit Congress to concentrate the roles of prosecutor, judge, and jury in the hands of the Executive Branch.  That is the very opposite of the separation of powers that the Constitution demands.  Jarkesy and Patriot28 are entitled to a jury trial in an Article III court.

It must be reading from a different case than we are.  <em>Oceanic Steam Navigation</em> expressly confines its analysis to the exercise of Congress’s power over <em>foreign </em>commerce.  214 U.&nbsp;S., at 339 (“It is insisted that the decisions just stated and the legislative practices referred to are inapposite here, because they all relate to subjects peculiarly within the authority of the legislative department of the Government, and which, from the necessity of things, required the concession that administrative officers should have the authority to enforce designated penalties without resort to the courts.  But over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of Congress more complete than it is over that with which the act we are now considering deals.); <em>id</em>.,<em> </em>at 334 (explaining that the statute “rest[s] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. upon the authority of Congress over <em>foreign </em>commerce and its right to control the coming of aliens into the United States” (emphasis added)); <em>id</em>., at<em> </em>340 (citing “the authority of Congress over the right to bring aliens into the United States”); see <em>id</em>., at 339 (discussing congressional power over “the valuation of imported merchandise,” “&nbsp;‘importers,’&nbsp;” and “tariff[s]” (quoting <em>Bartlett</em> v. <em>Kane</em>, 16 How. 263, 274 (1854)); 214 U.&nbsp;S., at 334 (expressly acknowledging and avoiding comment on “&nbsp;‘limitations’&nbsp;” of Congress’s “&nbsp;‘interstate commerce’&nbsp;” power because this case concerns instead Congress’s exercise of its “&nbsp;‘plenary power in respect to the exclusion of merchandise brought from <em>foreign </em>countries’&nbsp;” (quoting <em>Buttfield</em> v. <em>Stranahan</em>, <a aria-label=\"192 U. S. 470\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/192/470\">192 U.&nbsp;S. 470</a>, 492 (1904); emphasis added).  Nowhere does <em>Oceanic Steam Navigation </em>say that the public rights exception applies to cases concerning the securities markets or interstate commerce more broadly.  The rules the dissent purports to locate in <em>Oceanic Steam Navigation</em> are therefore wholly inapposite.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-2\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Roberts Opinion at reference 2\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-2ref\">2</a> &nbsp;The dissent would brush away these careful distinctions and unfurl a new rule: that whenever Congress passes a statute “entitl[ing] the Government to civil penalties,” the defendant’s right to a jury and a neutral Article III adjudicator disappears.  See <em>post</em>, at 2 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Sotomayor</span>, J.).  It bases this rule not in the constitutional text (where it would find no foothold), nor in the ratification history (where again it would find no support), nor in a careful, category-by-category analysis of underlying legal principles of the sort performed by <em>Murray’s Lessee</em> (which it does not attempt), nor even in a case-specific functional analysis (also not attempted).  Instead, the dissent extrapolates from the outcomes in cases concerning unrelated applications of the public rights exception and from one opinion, <em>Atlas Roofing Co. </em>v. <em>Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm’n, </em><a aria-label=\"430 U.S. 442\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/430/442\">430 U.&nbsp;S. 442 (1977)</a>.  The result is to blur the distinctions our cases have drawn in favor of the legally unsound principle that just because the Government may extract civil penalties in administrative tribunals in some contexts, it must always be able to do so in all contexts.The dissent also appeals to practice, ignoring that the statute Jarkesy and Patriot28 have been prosecuted under is barely over a decade old.  It is also unclear how practice could transmute a private right into a public one, or how the absence of legal challenges brought by one generation could waive the individual rights of the next.  Practice may be probative when it reflects the settled institutional understandings of the branches.  That case is far weaker when the rights of individuals are directly at stake.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-3\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Roberts Opinion at reference 3\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-3ref\">3</a> &nbsp;The dissent chides us for “leav[ing] open the possibility that <em>Granfinanciera</em> might have overruled <em>Atlas Roofing</em>.”  <em>Post</em>, at 25, n.&nbsp;8 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Sotomayor</span>, J.).  But the author of <em>Atlas Roofing</em> certainly thought that <em>Granfinanciera </em>may have done so.  See <em>Granfinanciera</em>, 492 U.&nbsp;S., at 79 (White, J., dissenting) (“Perhaps .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <em>Atlas Roofing</em> is no longer good law after today’s decision.”); see also <em>id</em>., at 71, n. 1 (<em>Granfinanciera</em> “can be read as overruling or severely limiting” <em>Atlas Roofing</em>).</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-4\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Roberts Opinion at reference 4\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-4ref\">4</a> &nbsp;Reading the dissent, one might also think that <em>Atlas Roofing </em>is among this Court’s most celebrated cases.  As the concurrence shows, <em>Atlas Roofing</em> represents a departure from our legal traditions.  See <em>post</em>, at 12–20 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Gorsuch</span>, J.).This view is also reflected in the scholarship.  Commentators writing comprehensively on Article III and agency adjudication have often simply ignored the case.  See, <em>e.g</em>., R. Fallon, Of Legislative Courts, Administrative Agencies, and Article III, 101 Harv. L. Rev. 915 (1988) (no citation to <em>Atlas Roofing</em>); J. Harrison, Public Rights, Private Privileges, and Article III, 54 Ga. L. Rev. 143 (2019) (same); W. Baude, Adjudication Outside Article III, 133 Harv. L.&nbsp;Rev. 1511 (2020) (same).Others who have considered it have offered nothing but a variety of criticisms.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., R.

It does.  As the Court details, the government has historically litigated suits of this sort before juries, and the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> requires no less.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> I write separately to highlight that other constitutional provisions reinforce the correctness of the Court’s course.  The <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a>’s jury-trial right does not work alone.  It operates together with Article III and the Due Process Clause of the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution fifth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment\">Fifth Amendment</a> to limit how the government may go about depriving an individual of life, liberty, or property.  The <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> guarantees the right to trial by jury.  Article III entitles individuals to an independent judge who will preside over that trial.  And due process promises any trial will be held in accord with time-honored principles.  Taken together, all three provisions vindicate the Constitution’s promise of a “fair trial in a fair tribunal.”  <em>In&nbsp;re Murchison</em>, <a aria-label=\"349 U. S. 133\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/349/133\">349 U.&nbsp;S. 133</a>, 136 (1955).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">I</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> In March 2013, the SEC’s Commissioners approved &nbsp;charges against Mr. Jarkesy.  The charges were serious; the agency accused him of defrauding investors.  The relief the agency sought was serious, too:  millions of dollars in civil penalties.  See SEC, Division of Enforcement’s Post-Hearing Memorandum of Law in <em>In&nbsp;re John Thomas Capital Management Group, LLC</em>, Admin. Proc. File No. 3–15255, pp.&nbsp;28–29 (SEC, Apr. 7, 2014).  For most of the SEC’s 90-year existence, the Commission had to go to federal court to secure that kind of relief against someone like Mr. Jarkesy.  <em>Ante</em>, at 3–4.  Proceeding that way in this case hardly would have promised him an easy ride.  But it would have at least guaranteed Mr. Jarkesy a jury, an independent judge, and traditional procedures designed to ensure that anyone caught up in our judicial system receives due process.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In 2010, however, all that changed.  With the passage of the Dodd Frank Act, Congress gave the SEC an alternative to court proceedings.  Now, the agency could funnel cases like Mr. Jarkesy’s through its own “adjudicatory” system.  See <a href=\"/rio/citation/124_Stat._1376\">124 Stat. 1376</a>, 1862–1865.  That is the route the SEC chose when it filed charges against Mr. Jarkesy.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> There is little mystery why.  The new law gave the SEC’s Commissioners—the same officials who authorized the suit against Mr. Jarkesy—the power to preside over his case themselves and issue judgment.  To be sure, the Commissioners opted, as they often do, to send Mr. Jarkesy’s case in the first instance to an “administrative law judge” (ALJ).  See <a aria-label=\"17 CFR\" href=\"/cfr/text/17\">17</a> CFR §201.110 (2023).  But the title “judge” in this context is not quite what it might seem.  Yes, ALJs enjoy some measure of independence as a matter of regulation and statute from the lawyers who pursue charges on behalf of the agency.  But they remain servants of the same master—the very agency tasked with prosecuting individuals like Mr. Jarkesy.  This close relationship, as others have long recognized, can make it “extremely difficult, if not impossible, for th[e ALJ] to convey the image of being an impartial fact finder.”  B. Segal, The Administrative Law &nbsp;Judge, 62 A.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;J. 1424, 1426 (1976).  And with a jury out of the picture, the ALJ decides not just the law but the facts as well.<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Gorsuch Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_5-1\" id=\"CONCUR_5-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Going in, then, the odds were stacked against Mr. Jarkesy.  The numbers confirm as much:  According to one report, during the period under study the SEC won about 90% of its contested in-house proceedings compared to 69% of its cases in court.  D. Thornley &amp; J. Blount, SEC In-House Tribunals:  A Call for Reform, 62 Vill. L.&nbsp;Rev. 261, 286 (2017) (Thornley).  Reportedly, too, one of the SEC’s handful of ALJs even warned individuals during settlement discussions that he had found defendants liable in every contested case and never once “&nbsp;‘ruled against the agency’s enforcement division.’&nbsp;”  <em>Axon Enterprise, Inc.</em> v. <em>FTC</em>, <a aria-label=\"598 U. S. 175\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/598/175\">598 U.&nbsp;S. 175</a>, 213–214 (2023) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Gorsuch</span>, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The shift from a court to an ALJ didn’t just deprive Mr. Jarkesy of the right to an independent judge and a jury.  He also lost many of the procedural protections our courts supply in cases where a person’s life, liberty, or property is at stake.  After an agency files a civil complaint in court, a defendant may obtain from the SEC a large swathe of documents relevant to the lawsuit.  See <a aria-label=\"Federal Rules of Civil Procedure rule 26 rule 26...\" href=\"/rules/frcp/rule_26#rule_26_b_1\">Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 26(b)(1)</a>.  He may subpoena third parties for testimony and documents and take 10 oral depositions—more with the court’s permission.  Rule 45; Rule 30(a)(2)(A)(i).  A court has flexibility, as well, to set deadlines for discovery and other matters to meet the needs of the case.  See Rule 16.  And &nbsp;come trial, the Federal Rules of Evidence apply, meaning that hearsay is generally inadmissible and witnesses must usually testify in person, subject to cross-examination.  See <a aria-label=\"Federal Rules of Evidence rule 802\" href=\"/rules/fre/rule_802\">Fed. Rule Evid. 802</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Things look very different in agency proceedings.  The SEC has a responsibility to provide “documents that contain material exculpatory evidence.”  <a aria-label=\"17 CFR\" href=\"/cfr/text/17\">17</a> CFR §201.230(b)(3).  But the defendant enjoys no general right to discovery.  Though ALJs enjoy the power to issue subpoenas on the request of litigants like Mr. Jarkesy, §201.232(a), they “often decline to issue [them] or choose to significantly narrow their scope,” G. Mark, SEC and CFTC Administrative Proceedings, 19 U.&nbsp;Pa. J. Const. L. 45, 68 (2016).  Oral depositions are capped at five, with another two if the ALJ grants permission.  §201.233(a).  In some cases, an administrative trial must take place as soon as 1 month after service of the charges, and that hearing must follow within 10 months in even the most complex matters.  §201.360(a)(2)(ii).  The rules of evidence, including their prohibition against hearsay, do not apply with the same rigor they do in court.  §201.235(a)(5); see §201.230.  For that reason, live testimony often gives way to “investigative testimony”—that is, a “sworn statement” taken outside the presence of the defendant or his counsel.  §201.235(b).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> How did all this play out in Mr. Jarkesy’s case?  Accompanying its charges, the SEC disclosed 700 gigabytes of data—equivalent to between 15 and 25 million pages of information—it had collected during its investigation.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 164a; Complaint in <em>Jarkesy </em>v. <em>U.&nbsp;S. SEC</em>, No. 1:14–cv–00114 (DDC, Jan. 29, 2014), ECF Doc. 1, ¶49, pp.&nbsp;12–13.  Over Mr. Jarkesy’s protest that it would take “two lawyers or paralegals working twelve-hour days over four decades to review,” <em>ibid.</em>, the ALJ gave Mr. Jarkesy 10 months to prepare for his hearing, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 156a.  Then, after conducting that hearing, the ALJ turned around and obtained from the Commission “an extension of &nbsp;six months to file [her] initial decision.”  <em>In&nbsp;re John Thomas Capital Management Group LLC</em>, SEC Release No. 9631, p.&nbsp;1 (Aug. 13, 2014).  The reason?  The “&nbsp;‘size and complexity of the proceeding.’&nbsp;”  <em>Id</em>., at 2.  When that decision eventually arrived seven months after the hearing, the ALJ agreed with the SEC on every charge.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 155a–156a, 212a.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Mr. Jarkesy had the right to appeal to the Commission, but appeals to that politically accountable body (again, the same body that approved the charges) tend to go about as one might expect.  The Commission may decline to review the ALJ’s decision.  §201.411(b)(2).  If it chooses to hear the case, it may <em>increase</em> the penalty imposed on the defendant.  Thornley 286.  A defendant unhappy with the result can seek further review in court, though that process will take more time and money, too.  Nor will he find a jury there, only a judge who must follow the agency’s findings if they are supported by “&nbsp;‘more than a mere scintilla’&nbsp;” of evidence.  <em>Biestek</em> v. <em>Berryhill</em>, <a aria-label=\"587 U. S. 97\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/587/97\">587 U.&nbsp;S. 97</a>, 103 (2019).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Mr. Jarkesy filed an appeal anyway.  The Commission agreed to review the ALJ’s decision.  It then afforded itself the better part of six years to issue an opinion.  And, after all that, it largely agreed with the ALJ.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 71a–74a.  None of this likely came as a surprise to the SEC employees in the Division of Enforcement responsible for pressing the action against Mr. Jarkesy.  While his appeal was pending, employees in that division—including an “&nbsp;‘Enforcement Supervisor’&nbsp;” in the regional office prosecuting Mr. Jarkesy—accessed confidential memos by the Commissioners’ advisors about his appeal.  See SEC, Second Commission Statement Relating to Certain Administrative Adjudications 3 (June 2, 2023).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">II</h3>\n<h4 class=\"jy-center\">A</h4>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> If administrative proceedings like Mr. Jarkesy’s seem a &nbsp;thoroughly modern development, the British government and its agents engaged in a strikingly similar strategy in colonial America.  Colonial administrators routinely steered enforcement actions out of local courts and into vice-admiralty tribunals where they thought they would win more often.  These tribunals lacked juries.  They lacked truly independent judges.  And the procedures materially differed from those available in everyday common-law courts.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The vice-admiralty courts in the Colonies began as rough equivalents of English courts of admiralty.  E. Surrency, The Courts in the American Colonies, 11 Am. J. Legal Hist. 347, 355 (1967).  These courts generally concerned themselves with maritime matters arising on “the oceans and rivers and their immediate shores.”  C. Ubbelohde, The Vice-Admiralty Courts and the American Revolution 19 (1960) (Ubbelohde).  And the proceedings they used accorded more with civil law traditions than common law ones.  Among other things, this meant officials could try cases against colonists without a jury.  <em>Id.</em>, at 21.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Confined to admiralty disputes, perhaps the lack of a jury would have proven unexceptional (as juries were not usually required in such cases then, nor are they today).  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Lewis</em> v. <em>Lewis &amp; Clark Marine, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"531 U. S. 438\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/531/438\">531 U.&nbsp;S. 438</a>, 448 (2001).  But Parliament deployed these juryless tribunals in the Colonies to new ends that, according to John Adams, could fill “&nbsp;‘volumes.’&nbsp;”  Ubbelohde vii.  The creep away from the original province of those courts began with the grant of authority over violations of certain trade and customs laws.  But in the decade before the Revolution, the drip, drip, drip of expanding power became a torrent, as Parliament allowed more and more actions to be brought in colonial vice-admiralty courts.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Many of the matters added to vice-admiralty jurisdiction in the Colonies would have required juries in England.  <em>Id</em>., at 112.  But as the Massachusetts royal governor explained, &nbsp;colonial juries “&nbsp;‘were not to be trusted.’&nbsp;”  D. Lovejoy, Rights Imply Equality:  The Case Against Admiralty Jurisdiction in America, 1764–1776, 16 Wm. &amp; Mary Q. 459, 468 (1959).  Even violations that did not implicate the jury right normally would have been heard in England “before a court in [one’s] own neighborhood or county where [one] could count on traditional common-law procedure.”  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 471.  But by expanding the reach of vice-admiralty jurisdiction in the Colonies, Parliament denied similar protections to Americans.  See <em>Erlinger</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 602 U.&nbsp;S. ___, ___ (2024) (slip op., at 5).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Vice-admiralty court judges also lacked independence.  While judges in England since the end of the seventeenth century generally enjoyed the protection of tenure during good behavior, colonial judges usually served at the pleasure of the royal administration.  See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Will</em>, <a aria-label=\"449 U. S. 200\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/449/200\">449 U.&nbsp;S. 200</a>, 218–219 (1980).  And, doing away with the pretense of impartiality entirely, some vice-admiralty judges held dual appointments—for instance, as colonial attorneys general and<em> </em>vice-admiralty judges.  Ubbelohde 162–163.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Like the modern SEC, British colonial officials were not <em>required</em> to bring many of their cases before the vice-admiralty courts.  Often, Parliament gave those officials the option to proceed in either the ordinary common-law courts or the vice-admiralty courts.  Unsurprisingly, though, they sought to file where they were most likely to win.  And “[i]n this contest, the vice-admiralty courts were usually the victors.”  <em>Id</em>., at 21.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The abuses of these courts featured prominently in the calls for revolution.  In the First Continental Congress, the assembled delegates condemned how Parliament “extend[ed] the jurisdiction of Courts of Admiralty,” complained how colonial judges were “dependent on the &nbsp;Crown,” and demanded the right to the “common law of England” and the “great and inestimable privilege” of a jury trial.  Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress, Oct. 14, 1774, in 1 Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774–1789, pp.&nbsp;68–69 (W. Ford 1904 ed.).  Two years later, the drafters of the Declaration of Independence repeated these concerns, admonishing the King for “ma[king] Judges dependent on his Will alone,” ¶11, and “[f]or depriving [the colonists] in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury,” ¶20.  By that point, however, the “musket fire at Lexington and Concord .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. signaled the end not only of the vice-admiralty courts, but of all British rule in America.”  Ubbelohde 190.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> When the smoke settled, the American people went to great lengths to prevent a backslide toward anything like the vice-admiralty courts.  <em>Erlinger</em>, 602 U.&nbsp;S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 5–6).  One product of these efforts was Article III of the Constitution.  There, the Constitution provided that “[t]he judicial Power”—the power over “Cases” and “Controversies”—would lie with life-tenured, salary-protected judges.  §§1–2; see <em>Oil States Energy Services, LLC</em> v. <em>Greene’s Energy Group, LLC</em>, <a aria-label=\"584 U. S. 325\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/584/325\">584 U.&nbsp;S. 325</a>, 346 (2018) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Gorsuch</span>,&nbsp;J., dissenting).  As the Court has recognized, this meant the Executive Branch could “exercise no part of th[e] judicial power.”  <em>Murray’s Lessee</em> v. <em>Hoboken Land &amp; Improvement Co.</em>, 18 How. 272, 275 (1856), “no matter how court-like [its] decisionmaking process might appear,” <em>Ortiz</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"585 U. S. 427\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/585/427\">585 U.&nbsp;S. 427</a>, 465 (2018) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Alito</span>,&nbsp;J., dissenting).  Nor could Congress “withdraw from judicial cognizance any matter which, from its nature, is the subject of a suit at the common law, or in equity, or admiralty”—the traditional scope of the “judicial Power.”  <em>Murray’s Lessee</em>, 18 How., at 284; see Art. III, §2.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Despite these guarantees, many at the founding thought Article III didn’t go far enough.  Yes, it promised a defendant an independent judge rather than one dependent on &nbsp;those who hold political power.  But what would stop Congress from requiring litigants to navigate vice-admiralty’s alien procedures in <em>all</em> federal cases?  Or from making “federal processes” even <em>more</em> byzantine, so “as to [effectively] destroy [individual] rights?”  Letter from a Federal Farmer (Jan. 20, 1788), in 2 The Complete Anti-Federalist 328 (H. Storing ed. 1981).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> And what about civil juries?  “[T]he jury trial,” one prominent Anti-Federalist observed, “brings with it an open and public discussion of all causes, and excludes secret and arbitrary proceedings.”  Letter from a Federal Farmer (Jan. 18, 1788), in <em>id</em>., at 320 (Federal Farmer 15).  The participation of ordinary Americans “drawn from the body of the people” serves another function, too:  “If the conduct of judges shall .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. tend to subvert the laws, and change the forms of government, the jury may check them.”  <em>Ibid.</em>  As originally composed, however, the Constitution promised a trial by jury for “all Crimes,” but said nothing about civil cases.  Art III, §2, cl.&nbsp;3.  Some wondered, did this mean judges, not juries, would be “left masters as to facts” in civil disputes?  Federal Farmer 15, at 322.  If so, asked another, “what satisfaction can we expect from a lordly court of justice, always ready to protect the officers of government against the weak and helpless citizen”?  Essay of a Democratic Federalist (Oct. 17, 1787), in 3 Complete Anti-Federalist 61.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The answer to these concerns was the Bill of Rights.  <em>Erlinger</em>, 602 U.&nbsp;S., at ___ (slip op., at 6).  As the Court details, the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> promised the right to a jury trial in “&nbsp;‘[s]uits at common law.’&nbsp;”  <em>Ante</em>, at 8 (quoting Amdt. 7).  But because the Constitution was designed to “endure for ages to come,” <em>McCulloch</em> v. <em>Maryland</em>, 4 Wheat. 316, 415 (1819), this did not mean only those “suits, which the common law recognized among its old and settled proceedings,” <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Bedford</em>, 3 Pet. 433, 447 (1830).  The founding &nbsp;generation anticipated the possibility Congress would introduce new causes of action and perhaps new remedies, too.  See <em>ibid.</em>  Accordingly, this Court has long understood the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a>’s protections to apply in “all [civil] suits which are not of equity [or] admiralty jurisdiction.”  <em>Ibid.</em>; accord, <em>ante</em>, at 8–9.  In this way, the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> seeks to ensure there will be no juryless vice-admiralty courts in the United States.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The <a aria-label=\"US Constitution fifth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment\">Fifth Amendment</a>’s Due Process Clause addressed remaining concerns about the processes that would attend trials before independent judges and juries.  It provided that the government may not deprive anyone of “life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”  As originally understood, this provision prohibited the government from “depriv[ing] a person of those rights without affording him the benefit of (at least) those customary procedures to which freemen were entitled by the old law of England.”  <em>Sessions</em> v. <em>Dimaya</em>, <a aria-label=\"584 U. S. 148\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/584/148\">584 U.&nbsp;S. 148</a>, 176 (2018) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Gorsuch</span>,&nbsp;J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (internal quotation marks omitted); see <em>Erlinger</em>, 602 U.&nbsp;S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 6–7).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> More than that, because it was “the peculiar province of the judiciary” to safeguard life, liberty, and property, due process often meant <em>judicial</em> process.  1 St. George Tucker, Blackstone’s Commentaries, Editor’s App. 358 (1803).  That is, if the government sought to interfere with those rights, nothing less than “the process and proceedings of the common law” had to be observed before any such deprivation could take place.  3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States §1783, p.&nbsp;661 (1833) (Story).  In other words, “&nbsp;‘due process of law’ generally implie[d] and include[d] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <em>judex</em> [a judge], regular allegations, opportunity to answer, and a trial according to some settled course of judicial proceedings.”  <em>Murray’s Lessee</em>, 18 How., at 280.  This constitutional baseline was designed to serve &nbsp;as “a restraint on the legislative” branch, preventing Congress from “mak[ing] any process ‘due process of law,’ by its mere will.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 276.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">C</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> These three constitutional provisions were meant to work together, and together they make quick work of this case.  In fact, each provision requires the result the Court reaches today.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>First</em>, because the “&nbsp;‘matter’&nbsp;” before us is one “which, from its nature, is the subject of a suit at the common law,” <em>id.</em>, at 284, “the responsibility for deciding [it] rests with Article III judges in Article III courts.”  <em>Stern</em> v. <em>Marshall</em>, <a aria-label=\"564 U. S. 462\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/564/462\">564 U.&nbsp;S. 462</a>, 484 (2011).  Nor does it make a difference whether we think of the SEC’s action here as a civil-penalties suit or something akin to a traditional fraud claim:  At the founding, both kinds of actions were tried in common-law courts.  See <em>ante</em>, at 9–13 (discussing civil penalties); see also, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Pasley</em> v. <em>Freeman</em>, 3 T.&nbsp;R. 51, 100 Eng. Rep. 450 (K.&nbsp;B. 1789) (action for fraud); <em>Baily </em>v. <em>Merrell</em>, 3 Bulst. 94, 81 Eng. Rep. 81 (K.&nbsp;B. 1615) (same).  And that tells us all we need to know that the SEC’s in-house civil-penalty scheme violates Article III by “withdraw[ing]” the matter “from judicial cognizance” and handing it over to the Executive Branch for an in-house trial.  <em>Murray’s Lessee</em>, 18 How., at 284; see <em>supra</em>, at 7–8.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Second</em>, because the action the SEC seeks to pursue is not the stuff of equity or admiralty jurisdiction but the sort of suit historically adjudicated before common-law courts, the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> guarantees Mr. Jarkesy the right to have his case decided by a jury of his peers.  In this regard, it is irrelevant that the SEC derived its power to sue under a “new statut[e]” or that the agency proceeded under “a new cause of action.”  Brief for Petitioner 13, 22 (internal quotation marks omitted).  As we have seen, the government cannot evade the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> so easily.  See <em>ante</em>, at &nbsp;9; <em>supra</em>, at 8–10.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Third</em>, were there any doubt, the Due Process Clause confirms these conclusions.  Cf. <em>Murray’s Lessee</em>, 18 How., at 275 (explaining that the Article III challenge before the Court could “best be considered” as raising a due process question).  Because the penalty the SEC seeks would “depriv[e]” Mr. Jarkesy of “property,” Amdt. 5, due process demands nothing less than “the process and proceedings of the common law,” 3 Story §1783, at 661.  That means the regular course of trial proceedings with their usual protections, see<em> Murray’s Lessee</em>, 18 How., at 280, not the use of ad&nbsp;hoc adjudication procedures before the same agency responsible for prosecuting the law, subject only to hands-off judicial review, see <em>supra</em>, at 10–11.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">III</h3>\n<h4 class=\"jy-center\">A</h4>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The government resists these conclusions.  As the government sees it, this case implicates the so-called public rights exception.  One that defeats not only Mr. Jarkesy’s right to trial by jury, but also his right to proceed before an independent trial judge consistent with traditional judicial processes.  That is, on the government’s account, not only does the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> fall away; so does the usual operation of Article III and the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In the government’s view, the public rights exception “<em>at a minimum</em> allows Congress to create new statutory obligations, impose civil penalties for their violation, and then commit to an administrative agency the function of deciding whether a violation has in fact occurred.”  Brief for Petitioner 21 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted).  Put plainly, all that need be done to dispense almost entirely with three separate constitutional provisions is an Act of Congress creating some new statutory obligation.  And, the government continues, this case easily meets that standard because the proceeding against Mr. Jarkesy is one &nbsp;“brought by the government against a private party” under a statute designed “to remedy harm to the public at large.”  <em>Id</em>., at 24 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Court rightly rejects these arguments.  See <em>ante</em>, at 19–21.  No one denies that, under the public rights exception, Congress may allow the Executive Branch to resolve certain matters free from judicial involvement in the first instance.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6, 14–15.  But, despite its misleading name, the exception does not refer to <em>all</em> matters brought by the government against an individual to remedy public harms, or even all those that spring from a statute.  See <em>ante</em>, at 16–17.  Instead, public rights are a narrow class defined and limited by history.  As the Court explains, that class has traditionally included the collection of revenue, customs enforcement, immigration, and the grant of public benefits.  <em>Ante</em>, at 15–17.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> How did these matters find themselves categorized as public rights?  Competing explanations abound.  Some have pointed to ancient practical considerations.  In <em>Murray’s Lessee</em>, for example, the Court reasoned that the “[i]mperative necessity” of tax collection for a functional state had long caused governments to treat “claims for public taxes” differently from “all others.”  18 How., at 282.  Others have theorized that “the core of the judicial power” concerns the disposition of the “three ‘absolute’ rights” “to life, liberty, and property.”  <em>Wellness Int’l Network, Ltd.</em> v. <em>Sharif</em>, <a aria-label=\"575 U. S. 665\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/575/665\">575 U.&nbsp;S. 665</a>, 713–714 (2015) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas</span>,&nbsp;J., dissenting).  Public rights, the theory goes, involve matters originally understood to fall outside this core.  <em>Id</em>., at 714.  So, for example, “[a]lthough Congress could authorize executive agencies to dispose of <em>public</em> rights in land—often by means of adjudicating a claimant’s qualifications for a land grant under a statute—the United States had to go to the courts if it wished to revoke” that grant, which had become the owner’s private property.  <em>Id</em>., at 715.  There are still other theories yet.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Stern</em>, 564 U.&nbsp;S., at 489.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; Whatever their roots, traditionally recognized public rights have at least one feature in common:  a serious and unbroken historical pedigree.  See <em>Culley</em> v. <em>Marshall</em>, <a aria-label=\"601 U. S. 377\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/601/377\">601 U.&nbsp;S. 377</a>, 397–398 (2024) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Gorsuch</span>,&nbsp;J., concurring); <em>ante</em>, at 14–17.  For good reason.  If the Article III “judicial Power” encompasses “the stuff of the traditional actions at common law tried by the courts of Westminster in 1789,” <em>ante</em>, at 14 (internal quotation marks omitted), it follows that matters traditionally adjudicated outside those courts might <em>not</em> fall within Article III’s ambit.  See <em>Stern</em>, 564 U.&nbsp;S., at 504–505 (Scalia,&nbsp;J., concurring) (“[A]n Article III judge is required in <em>all </em>federal adjudications, unless there is a firmly established historical practice to the contrary”).  So too with the Due Process Clause.  If that clause sets customary common-law practice as the ordinary procedural baseline, see Part II–B, <em>supra</em>, clear historical evidence of a different practice might warrant a departure from that baseline, see <em>Murray’s Lessee</em>, 18 How., at 280.  That’s why this Court has said “&nbsp;‘a process of law .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. must be taken to be due process of law’ if it enjoys ‘the sanction of settled usage both in England and in this country.’&nbsp;”  <em>Culley</em>, 601 U.&nbsp;S., at 397 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Gorsuch</span>,&nbsp;J., concurring) (quoting <em>Hurtado </em>v. <em>California</em>, <a aria-label=\"110 U. S. 516\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/110/516\">110 U.&nbsp;S. 516</a>, 528 (1884)).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> With the public rights exception viewed in this light, the government’s invocation of it in this case cannot succeed.  Starting with a “&nbsp;‘presumption .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in favor of Article III courts’&nbsp;” and their usual attendant processes, <em>ante</em>, at 18, we look for some “deeply rooted” tradition of nonjudicial adjudication before permitting a case to be tried in a different forum under different procedures, <em>Culley</em>, 601 U.&nbsp;S., at 397 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Gorsuch</span>,&nbsp;J., concurring).  We have upheld summary procedures for customs collection, for example, because they were consistent with both “the common and statute law of England prior to the emigration of our ancestors” and “the laws of many of the States at the time of the adoption of&nbsp;” the Constitution.  <em>Murray’s Lessee</em>, 18 How., at 280; see <em>ante</em>, at 14–15.  But when it comes to the kind of civil-penalty suit before us, that same history points in the opposite direction, suggesting actions of this sort belong before an independent judge, a jury, and decided in a trial that accords with traditional judicial procedures.  <em>Ante</em>, at 9–13; <em>supra</em>, at 11–12.  Just as SEC practices themselves largely reflected as recently as 2010.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> If all that’s so, why might the government feel comfortable invoking the public rights exception?  To be fair, much of it may have to do with this Court.  Some of our past decisions have allowed the government to chip away at the courts’ historically exclusive role in adjudicating private rights—and juries’ accompanying role in that adjudication.  This process began, of all places, in an admiralty case.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>Benson</em>, <a aria-label=\"285 U.S. 22\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/285/22\">285 U.&nbsp;S. 22 (1932)</a>,<em> </em>this Court faced a constitutional challenge to the Longshoremen’s and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act of 1927.  The Act directed employers to compensate employees for injuries occurring at sea.  <a href=\"/rio/citation/44_Stat._1426\">44 Stat. 1426</a>.  The law further assigned primary responsibility for deciding liability disputes to an Executive Branch official, the deputy commissioner of the United States Employees’ Compensation Commission.  <em>Id</em>., at 1435–1437; <em>Crowell</em>, 285 U.&nbsp;S., at 42–43.  The Court acknowledged that this regime empowered the deputy commissioner to decide in the first instance the monetary “liability of one individual to another.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 51.  The Court recognized that this amounted to a classic “private right” suit of the kind traditionally tried in court.  <em>Ibid</em>.  The Court even conceded that, under the law, the factual “findings of the deputy commissioner, supported by evidence and within the scope of his authority, shall be final”:  An Article III court could not review the facts anew.  <em>Id.</em>, at 46. <em> </em>But the Court upheld the scheme and its limited judicial review anyway.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; To get there took a dash of fiction and a pinch of surmise.  From time to time, the Court observed, judges appoint their own special “masters and commissioners” to prepare reports on fact issues or damages.  <em>Id</em>., at 51.  These reports are nonbinding and “essentially .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. advisory.”  <em>Ibid</em>.<em> </em>Judges themselves remain the decisionmakers.  In <em>Crowell</em>, the Court embraced the fiction that Executive Branch officials might similarly act as assistants or adjuncts to Article III courts.  And because judges often adopt the proposed findings of their masters and commissioners, the Court surmised, Article III posed no bar to Congress taking a further step and <em>requiring</em> judges to treat the findings of Executive Branch officials as essentially “final.”  <em>Id</em>., at 46.  “To hold otherwise,” the Court reasoned, “would be to defeat the obvious purpose of the legislation”:  “to furnish a prompt, continuous, expert, and inexpensive method for dealing with a class of questions of fact which are peculiarly suited to examination and determination by an administrative agency specially assigned to that task.”  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"><em> Crowell </em>itself only went so far, however.  The case fell within federal courts’ admiralty jurisdiction, and tribunals sitting in admiralty in England and America alike had long heard certain matters falling within the public rights exception.  See <em>Culley</em>, 601 U.&nbsp;S., at 398 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Gorsuch</span>,&nbsp;J., concurring).  In deciding those matters, courts had long tolerated some flexibility in procedures, had long restricted appellate review of factual findings, and had always proceeded without a jury.  <em>Crowell</em>, 285 U.&nbsp;S., at 45, 53.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"><em> </em>Soon, though, none of that mattered.  Almost in a blink, the admiralty limitation was discarded, and more and more agencies began assuming adjudicatory functions previously reserved for judges and juries, employing novel procedures that sometimes bore faint resemblance to those observed in court.  Along the way, prominent voices in and out of government expressed concern at this development.  Consider just two typical examples.  Were an agency endowed with &nbsp;the power to assess civil penalties, advised a committee overseen by Attorney General (soon-to-be Justice) Robert H. Jackson, “the aggrieved person” should at least “be permitted review de&nbsp;novo by a Federal district court.”  Final Report of Attorney General’s Committee on Administrative Procedure 147 (1941).  That was the only way, the committee opined, “to resolve any doubts concerning the constitutionality of the procedure.”  <em>Ibid.</em>  Around the same time, a committee of the American Bar Association led by Roscoe Pound sounded a similar alarm.  Administrative agencies, the committee warned, had a “tendency to mix up rule making, investigation, prosecution, the advocate’s function, the judge’s function, and the function of enforcing the judgment, so that the whole proceeding from end to end is one to give effect to a complaint.”  Report of the Special Committee on Administrative Law, 63 Ann. Rep. 331, 351 (1938).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The high-water mark of the movement toward agency adjudication may have come in 1977 in <em>Atlas Roofing Co.</em> v. <em>Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm’n</em>, <a aria-label=\"430 U. S. 442\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/430/442\">430 U.&nbsp;S. 442</a>.  Some have read that decision to suggest the category of public rights might encompass pretty much any case arising under any “&nbsp;‘new statutory obligations,’&nbsp;” Brief for Petitioner 22 (quoting <em>Atlas Roofing</em>, 430 U.&nbsp;S., at 450).  It is a view the government essentially espouses in this case.  But without reference to any constitutional text or history to guide what does or does not qualify as a public right, that view has (unsurprisingly) proven wholly unworkable.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> It did not take long for this Court to realize as much.  Just 12 years later, in <em>Granfinanciera, S.&nbsp;A.</em> v. <em>Nordberg</em>, <a aria-label=\"492 U.S. 33\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/492/33\">492 U.&nbsp;S. 33 (1989)</a>, this Court cabined <em>Atlas Roofing</em> so narrowly that the author of <em>Atlas Roofing </em>complained that the Court had “overrul[ed]” it.  492 U.&nbsp;S., at 71, n.&nbsp;1 (White, J., dissenting); see <em>ante</em>, at 23, n.&nbsp;3.  Far from endorsing the notion that any new statutory obligation could qualify for &nbsp;treatment as a public right, for example, the Court in <em>Granfinancieria</em> read <em>Atlas Roofing</em> as having “left the term ‘public rights’ undefined.”  492 U.&nbsp;S., at 51, n.&nbsp;8.  And since then this Court has, in one case after another, “adhere[d]” only to <em>Atlas Roofing’s</em> “general teaching” that Congress may constitutionally adopt “new statut[es]&nbsp;” assigning matters that indeed qualify as “public rights .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to an administrative agency.”  492 U.&nbsp;S., at 51 (internal quotation marks omitted); see, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Stern</em>, 564 U.&nbsp;S., at 489–490; <em>Oil States</em>, 584 U.&nbsp;S., at 345.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Yet, even after the Court moved away from <em>Atlas Roofing</em>, our public rights jurisprudence remained muddled.  Since then, the Court has suggested that public rights might include those “involving statutory rights that are integral parts of a public regulatory scheme.”  <em>Granfinanciera</em>, 492 U.&nbsp;S., at 55, n.&nbsp;10.  We have changed course and tried our hand at a five-factor balancing test.  See <em>Stern</em>, 564 U.&nbsp;S., at 491 (describing <em>Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n</em> v. <em>Schor</em>, <a aria-label=\"478 U.S. 833\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/478/833\">478 U.&nbsp;S. 833 (1986)</a>).  We have replaced that test with one that considers “at least seven different” factors.  564 U.&nbsp;S., at 504 (Scalia,&nbsp;J., concurring).  And at one time or another, these factors have included the consideration of “the concerns that drove Congress to depart from the requirements of Article III.”  <em>Schor</em>, 478 U.&nbsp;S., at 851.  So, for example, we have asked whether insistence on “the institutional integrity of the Judicial Branch” would “unduly constrict Congress’ ability to take needed and innovative action pursuant to its Article I powers.”  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Today, the Court does much to return us to a more traditional understanding of public rights.  Adhering to <em>Granfinancieria</em>, the Court rejects the government’s overbroad reading of <em>Atlas Roofing</em> and recognizes that the kind of atextual and ahistorical (not to mention confusing) tests it inspired do little more than ask policy questions the Constitution settled long ago.  Yes, a limited category of public rights were originally and even long before understood to &nbsp;be susceptible to resolution without a court, jury, or the other usual protections an Article III court affords.  But outside of those limited areas, we have no license to deprive the American people of their constitutional right to an independent judge, to a jury of their peers, or to the procedural protections at trial that due process normally demands.  Let alone do so whenever the government wishes to dispense with them.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This Court does not subject other constitutional rights to such shabby treatment.  We have “reaffirm[ed],” many times and “emphatically[,] that the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> does not permit the State to sacrifice speech for efficiency.”  <em>Riley</em> v. <em>National Federation of Blind of N.&nbsp;C., Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"487 U. S. 781\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/487/781\">487 U.&nbsp;S. 781</a>, 795 (1988).  We have rejected a framework for <a aria-label=\"US Constitution second Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment\">Second Amendment</a> challenges that would balance the right to bear arms against “&nbsp;‘other important governmental interests.’&nbsp;”  <em>District of Columbia</em> v. <em>Heller</em>, <a aria-label=\"554 U. S. 570\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/554/570\">554 U.&nbsp;S. 570</a>, 634 (2008).  It is hornbook <a aria-label=\"US Constitution fourth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment\">Fourth Amendment</a> law that “[a] generalized interest in expedient law enforcement cannot, without more, justify a warrantless search.”  <em>Georgia </em>v. <em>Randolph</em>, <a aria-label=\"547 U.

And even though the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution sixth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment\">Sixth Amendment</a>’s guarantee of a jury trial in criminal cases may have “&nbsp;‘its weaknesses and the potential for misuse,’&nbsp;” <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Louisiana</em>, <a aria-label=\"391 U.

Sixth Amendmen[t]”).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Why should Article III, the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a>, or the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution fifth Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment\">Fifth Amendment</a>’s promise of due process be any different?  None of them exists to “protec[t] judicial authority for its own sake.”  <em>Oil States</em>, 584 U.&nbsp;S., at 356 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Gorsuch</span>,&nbsp;J., dissenting).  They exist to “protect the individual.”  <em>Bond </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"564 U. S. 211\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/564/211\">564 U.&nbsp;S. 211</a>, 222 (2011).  And their protec&nbsp;tions are no less vital than those afforded by other constitutional provisions.  As American colonists learned under British rule, “the right of trial” means little “when the actual administration of justice is dependent upon caprice, or favour, [or] the will of rulers.”  3 Story §1568, at 426; <em>id</em>., §1783, at 661.  In recognizing as much today, the Court essentially follows the advice of Justices Brennan and Marshall, “limit[ing] the judicial authority of non-Article III federal tribunals to th[o]se few, long-established exceptions” that bear the sanction of history, and “countenanc[ing] no further erosion.”  <em>Schor</em>, 478 U.&nbsp;S., at 859 (Brennan, J., joined by Marshall, J., dissenting).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">C</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The dissent’s competing account of public rights is astonishing.  On its telling, the Constitution might impose some (undescribed) limits on the power of the government to send cases “involving the liability of one individual to another” to executive tribunals for resolution.  <em>Post</em>, at 22 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Sotomayor</span>,&nbsp;J.).  But, thanks to public rights doctrine, the dissent insists, the Constitution imposes <em>no</em> limits on the government’s power to seek civil penalties “outside the regular courts of law where there are no juries.”  <em>Post</em>, at 2.  In that field, the Constitution falls silent.  The dissent does not even attempt to deploy any of the contrived balancing tests that emerged in <em>Atlas Roofing</em>’s aftermath to rein in the government’s power.  But where in Article III, the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a>, and due process can the dissent find this new rule?  What about founding-era practice or original meaning?  And why would a Constitution drawn up to protect against arbitrary government action make it easier for the government than for private parties to escape its dictates?  The dissent offers no answers.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> To be sure, the dissent tries to appeal to precedent.  It even asserts that our decisions support, “<em>without exception</em>,” its sweeping conception of public rights doctrine.  <em>Post</em>, at &nbsp;12 (emphasis added).  But the dissent’s approach to our precedents is like a picky child at the dinner table.  It selects only a small handful while leaving much else untouched.  To start, the dissent lingers briefly on <em>Murray’s Lessee</em>—but not long enough to explain the opinion’s conception of Article III, due process, or the extended historical inquiry that led the Court to conclude the collection of revenue concerned a public right.  See <em>post</em>, at 9–10; <em>supra</em>, at 8, 10–14.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The 19th century behind it (for it does not trouble with the founding era), the dissent turns to <em>Oceanic Steam Nav. Co.</em> v. <em>Stranahan</em>, <a aria-label=\"214 U.S. 320\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/214/320\">214 U.&nbsp;S. 320 (1909)</a>.  Drawing on that decision, the dissent contends that “Congress [has] routinely ‘impose[d] appropriate obligations’&nbsp;” by statute and<em> </em>given “&nbsp;‘executive officers the power to enforce’&nbsp;” them “&nbsp;‘without the necessity of invoking the judicial power.’&nbsp;”  <em>Post</em>, at 11 (quoting <em>Stranahan</em>, 214 U.&nbsp;S., at 339).  Notably absent from the dissent’s account, however, is the decision’s discussion of Congress’s long-recognized and extensive authority over the field of immigration, the area of law at issue there.  See <em>id.</em>, at 339.  Unmentioned, too, is <em>Stranahan</em>’s explanation that what links immigration to other public rights like “tariff[s], .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. internal revenue, taxation,” and “foreign commerce” is that, “&nbsp;‘from the beginning[,] Congress has exercised a plenary power’&nbsp;” over them “because they all relate to subjects peculiarly within the authority of the legislative department.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 334, 339.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Really, one has to wonder:  If the public rights exception is as broad and unqualified as the dissent asserts, why did our predecessors bother to discuss history or Congress’s peculiar powers when it comes to revenue and immigration?  Why didn’t the Court simply announce the rule the dissent would have us announce today:  that our Constitution does not stand in the way of “agency adjudications of statutory claims .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. brought by the Government in its sovereign ca&nbsp;pacity”?  <em>Post</em>, at 4.  The answer, of course, is that the Constitution has never countenanced the dissent’s notion that the Executive is free to reassign virtually any civil case in which it is a party to its own tribunals where its own employees decide cases and inconvenient juries and traditional trial procedures go by the boards.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> That my dissenting colleagues plow ahead anyway with their remarkable conception of public rights is all the more puzzling considering how regularly they have argued <em>against</em> that sort of sweeping concentration of governmental power.  The dissenters have recognized that a “lack of standardized procedural safeguards” can leave government enforcement schemes “vulnerable to abuse” and individuals subject to coercive “pressure from unchecked prosecutors.”  <em>Culley</em>, 601 U.&nbsp;S., at 405, 407 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Sotomayor</span>,&nbsp;J., joined by <span class=\"smallcaps\">Kagan</span> and <span class=\"smallcaps\">Jackson</span>,&nbsp;JJ., dissenting).  They have contended that the Judiciary has an affirmative obligation to supply “meaningful remedies,” trials before judges and juries included, even when “Congress or the Executive has [already] created a remedial process.”  <em>Egbert</em> v. <em>Boule</em>, <a aria-label=\"596 U. S. 482\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/596/482\">596 U.&nbsp;S. 482</a>, 524–525 (2022) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Sotomayor</span>,&nbsp;J., joined by, <em>inter alios</em>, <span class=\"smallcaps\">Kagan</span>,&nbsp;J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis deleted).  And like most every current Member of this Court at one time or another, they have acknowledged that the jury-trial right “stands as one of the Constitution’s most vital protections against arbitrary government.”  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Haymond</em>, <a aria-label=\"588 U. S. 634\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/588/634\">588 U.&nbsp;S. 634</a>, 637 (2019) (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The dissent’s conception of public rights is so unqualified that it refuses to commit itself on the question whether even muted forms of judicial review—such as asking executive tribunals to muster “more than a mere scintilla” of evidence in support of their rulings—are constitutionally required in the essentially unbounded class of cases that fall within its conception of public rights.  See Part I, <em>supra</em>; <em>post</em>, at 8, n.&nbsp;4.  Gone, too, is any role for the jury—for why would the &nbsp;government ever go to court if it may more readily secure a win before its own employees?  The only attempt to mitigate the havoc its rule would wreak comes when the dissent declares that “ ‘[t]he public-rights doctrine does not extend to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. criminal matters.’&nbsp;”  <em>Post</em>, at 27, n.&nbsp;9.  But the dissent does not (and cannot) explain how that fits with all else it says.  If, as the dissent insists, a public right is any “new right” that “belongs to the public and inheres in the Government in its sovereign capacity,” <em>post</em>, at 28, what could possibly better fit the description than the enforcement of new criminal laws?  See <em>Shinn </em>v. <em>Martinez</em> <em>Ramirez</em>, <a aria-label=\"596 U. S. 366\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/596/366\">596 U.&nbsp;S. 366</a>, 376 (2022) (“The power to convict and punish criminals lies at the heart of the States’ residuary and inviolable sovereignty” (internal quotation marks omitted)).<a aria-label=\"reference 2 of Gorsuch Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_5-2\" id=\"CONCUR_5-2ref\"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> All but admitting its view has no support in “historical practice dating back to the founding,” the dissent chastises the Court for daring to rely on that practice to flesh out the scope of the public rights exception.  <em>Post</em>, at 18.  It would be so much simpler, the dissent says, to adopt its rule permitting the government to skirt oversight by judge and jury alike whenever it enacts a new law.  And, true enough, “a principle that the government always wins surely would be simple for judges to implement.”  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Rahimi</em>, 602 U.&nbsp;S. ___, ___ (2024) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Gorsuch</span>,&nbsp;J., concurring) (slip op., at 6).  But looking to original meaning and historical practice informing it is exactly how this Court proceeds in so &nbsp;many other contexts where we seek to honor the Constitution’s demands—including, notably, when we seek to ascertain the scope of the <em>criminal</em> jury-trial right and the defendant’s attendant right to confront his accusers.  See <em>Erlinger</em>, 602 U.&nbsp;S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 19–20); <em>Crawford</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a aria-label=\"541 U. S. 36\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/541/36\">541 U.&nbsp;S. 36</a>, 50 (2004).  What’s more, this approach has the virtue of “keep[ing] judges in their proper lane” by “seeking to honor the supreme law the people have ordained rather than substituting our will for theirs.”  <em>Rahimi</em>, 602 U.&nbsp;S., at ___–___ (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Gorsuch</span>, J., concurring) (slip op., at 4–5); see <em>Crawford</em>, 541 U.&nbsp;S., at 67.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> It is hard, as well, to take seriously the dissent’s charges of unworkability and unpredictability.  At least until today, the dissenters supported procedural protections for those in the government’s sights in civil as well as criminal cases.  What kind of protections?  Often, they have argued, it depends on a judicial balancing test.  One that is “flexible,” defies “technical conception,” lacks “fixed content,”&nbsp; and will “not always yield the same result” even when applied in similar circumstances.  <em>Culley</em>, 601 U.&nbsp;S., at 413 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Sotomayor</span>,&nbsp;J.) (internal quotation marks omitted).  As we have seen, that was essentially the course some pursued, too, when it came to the public rights exception in the fallout from <em>Atlas Roofing</em>.  See Part III–B, <em>supra</em>.  But that kind of “&nbsp;‘we know it when we see it’&nbsp;” approach to constitutional rights,<em> post</em>, at 21, can hardly claim any serious advantages when it comes to workability or predictability.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Failing all else, the dissent retreats to <em>Atlas Roofing</em>.  At least that decision, it insists, supports its nearly boundless conception of public rights.  The dissent goes so far as to accuse the Court of undermining “<em>stare decisis</em> and the rule of law,” <em>post</em>, at 15, and engaging in “a power grab,” <em>post</em>, at 37, by failing to give <em>Atlas Roofing</em> its broadest possible construction.  It’s a “disconcerting” accusation indeed, <em>post</em>, at 36, and a misdirected one at that.  Construed as broadly as the dissent proposes, <em>Atlas Roofing</em>’s view of public rights &nbsp;stands as an outlier in our jurisprudence—with no apparent support in original meaning, at odds with prior precedent, and inconsistent with later precedent as well.  See <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 25, n.&nbsp;4; Part III–B, <em>supra</em>.  Meanwhile, the Court’s alternative construction of <em>Altas Roofing </em>fits far more comfortably with all those legal sources.  In that respect, the majority’s approach is of a piece with <em>Granfinanciera</em>’s similar approach 25 years ago.  And, more broadly, it is of a piece with our usual practice of construing “loose language” found in a prior judicial opinion in a way that better conforms it to the mainstream of our precedents.  <em>Groff </em>v. <em>DeJoy</em>, <a aria-label=\"600 U. S. 447\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/600/447\">600 U.&nbsp;S. 447</a>, 474 (2023) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Sotomayor</span>,&nbsp;J., concurring).  As the dissenters have previously acknowledged, that course is neither unusual nor at odds with <em>stare decisis</em>.  See <em>id</em>., at 474–475; see also <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Davenport</em>, <a aria-label=\"596 U. S. 118\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/596/118\">596 U.&nbsp;S. 118</a>, 141 (2022) (“We neither expect nor hope that our successors will comb these pages for stray comments and stretch them beyond their context—all to justify an outcome inconsistent with this Court’s reasoning and judgments”).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Were there any doubt about the propriety of the Court’s treatment of <em>Atlas Roofing</em>, consider one more feature of the alternative the dissent proposes.  In defending the broadest possible construction of <em>Atlas Roofing</em>’s public rights discussion, the dissent necessarily endorses that decision’s exceptionally narrow conception of the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a>.  See <em>post</em>, at 6.  After all, as public rights expand, so too the jury-trial right must contract.  Yet <em>Atlas Roofing</em>’s discussion of the jury-trial right, no less than its discussion of public rights, is difficult to square with precedent and original meaning.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Recall that, from the start, the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> was understood to protect that right “not merely” in suits recognized at common law, but in “<em>all</em> suits which are” of legal, as opposed to “equity [or] admiralty[,] jurisdiction.”  <em>Parsons</em>, 3 Pet., at 447 (emphasis added); see Part II–B, <em>supra</em>.  This Court repeated that understanding of the Amendment &nbsp;until well into the 1970s, noting, for example, that “the applicability of the constitutional right to jury trial in actions enforcing statutory rights” was “a matter too obvious to be doubted.”  <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Loether</em>, <a aria-label=\"415 U. S. 189\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/415/189\">415 U.&nbsp;S. 189</a>, 193 (1974) (internal quotation marks omitted); accord, <em>Pernell</em> v. <em>Southall Realty</em>, <a aria-label=\"416 U. S. 363\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/416/363\">416 U.&nbsp;S. 363</a>, 375 (1974) (the Seventh “Amendment requires trial by jury in actions unheard of at common law”).  And the Court rejected the notion that a statute must present “a close equivalent” to a common-law cause of action; the jury-trial right attached, we said, so long as the “action involve[d] rights and remedies of the sort traditionally enforced in an action at law.”  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"><em> Atlas Roofing</em> ignored all of that.  Instead, it<em> </em>suggested, “[t]he phrase ‘Suits at common law’ has been construed to refer to cases tried <em>prior</em> to the adoption of the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> in courts of law.”  430 U.&nbsp;S., at 449 (emphasis added).  That cramped construction of the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> was, of course, a key move in <em>Atlas Roofing</em>.  For without it, the Court would have been hard pressed to suggest the public rights doctrine permits Congress to route any “&nbsp;‘new cause of action’&nbsp;” for adjudication before agencies where juries do not sit.  <em>Post</em>, at 14 (quoting <em>Atlas Roofing</em>, 430 U.&nbsp;S., at 461).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Almost immediately, however, the Court rejected <em>Atlas Roofing</em>’s analysis, not just with respect to public rights doctrine but the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a>, too.  Returning to our mainstream precedents, the Court reaffirmed the applicability of the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> to new causes of action, first in <em>Tull</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"481 U.S. 412\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/481/412\">481 U.&nbsp;S. 412 (1987)</a>, and then in <em>Granfinanciera</em>.  See <em>ante</em>, at 8–9.  And by 1990, our case law had come full circle, announcing once again what has always been true:  that “[t]he right to a jury trial includes more than the common-law forms of action recognized in 1791.”  <em>Teamsters</em> v. <em>Terry</em>, <a aria-label=\"494 U. S. 558\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/494/558\">494 U.&nbsp;S. 558</a>, 564.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Today, the Court respects and follows this longstanding &nbsp;message in our <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> precedents.  The dissent chooses another path entirely—adopting a reading of <em>Atlas Roofing </em>that leads not only to an implausibly broad construction of public rights, but to an implausibly narrow understanding of the jury-trial guarantee as well.  One wholly at odds with precedents both old and new.  Nor is the dissent shy about its real motivation—and it has nothing to do with respect for precedent but much more to do with a “power grab”:  Holding the government to the Constitution’s promise of a jury trial, the dissent insists, would impose “constraints on what,” in its view, “modern-day adaptable governance must look like.”  <em>Post</em>, at 37.  All of which, at bottom, amounts to little more than a complaint with the Constitution’s revolutionary promise of popular oversight of government officials—and with those judges who would honor that promise.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">*</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> People like Mr. Jarkesy may be unpopular.  Perhaps even rightly so:  The acts he allegedly committed may warrant serious sanctions.  But that should not obscure what is at stake in his case or others like it.  While incursions on old rights may begin in cases against the unpopular, they rarely end there.  The authority the government seeks (and the dissent would award) in this case—to penalize citizens without a jury, without an independent judge, and under procedures foreign to our courts—certainly contains no such limits.  That is why the Constitution built “high walls and clear distinctions” to safeguard individual liberty.  <em>Plaut</em> v. <em>Spendthrift Farm, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"514 U. S. 211\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/514/211\">514 U.&nbsp;S. 211</a>, 239 (1995).  Ones that ensure even the least popular among us has an independent judge and a jury of his peers resolve his case under procedures designed to ensure a fair trial in a fair forum.  In reaffirming all this today, the Court hardly leaves the SEC without ample powers and recourse.  The agency is free to pursue all of its charges against Mr. &nbsp;Jarkesy.  And it is free to pursue them exactly as it had always done until 2010:  In a court, before a judge, and with a jury.  With these observations, I am pleased to concur.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<h3 class=\"fnheader\">Notes</h3>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"CONCUR_5-1\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Gorsuch Concurrence at reference 1\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#CONCUR_5-1ref\">1</a> &nbsp;In many agencies, litigants are not even entitled to have ALJs, with their modicum of protections, decide their cases.  These agencies use “administrative judges.”  Some agencies can replace these administrative judges if they don’t like their decisions.  And some of these judges may move in and out of prosecutorial and adjudicatory roles, or move in and out of the very industries their agencies regulate.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Arthrex, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"594 U. S. 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/594/1\">594 U.&nbsp;S. 1</a>, 36–37 (2021) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Gorsuch</span>, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"CONCUR_5-2\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Gorsuch Concurrence at reference 2\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#CONCUR_5-2ref\">2</a> &nbsp;The best the dissent can do is to observe that “Article III itself prescribes that ‘[t]he trial of all Crimes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall be by Jury.’&nbsp;”  <em>Post</em>, at 27, n.&nbsp;9 (quoting §2, cl.&nbsp;3).  That response might be reassuring if the dissent’s treatment of the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> didn’t supply a roadmap for working around it.  On the dissent’s telling, the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> can be dispensed with at will:  It applies “only in judicial proceedings,” and not whenever the government chooses to assign a matter to its own in-house tribunals.  <em>Post</em>, at 5.  And under that logic, there is no apparent reason why the government could not evade Article III’s jury-trial right just as easily, simply by choosing to route criminal prosecutions through executive agencies.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"dissent\">&nbsp;<hr><a aria-label=\"Top\" href=\"#writing-ZS\" id=\"writing-22-859_DISSENT_6\"><strong>TOP</strong></a>\n<h2>Dissent</h2>\n<div class=\"bodytext\">\n<p class=\"scusnameplate jy-center\">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p class=\"rule jy-center\">_________________</p>\n<p class=\"casenumber jy-center\">No. 22–859</p>\n<p class=\"rule jy-center\">_________________</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-a jy-center\">Securities and Exchange Commission, PETITIONER <em>v.</em> George R.

The Constitution, this Court has said, does not require these civil-penalty claims belonging to the Government to be tried before a jury in federal district court.  Congress can instead assign them to an agency for initial adjudication, subject to judicial review.  This Court has blessed that practice repeatedly, declaring it “the ‘settled judicial construction’&nbsp;” all along; indeed, “&nbsp;‘from the beginning.’&nbsp;”  <em>Atlas Roofing Co.</em> v. <em>Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm’n</em>, <a aria-label=\"430 U. S. 442\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/430/442\">430 U.&nbsp;S. 442</a>, 460 (1977).  Unsurprisingly, Congress has taken this Court’s word at face value.  It has enacted more than 200 statutes authorizing dozens of agencies to impose civil penalties for violations of statutory obligations.  Congress had no reason to anticipate the chaos today’s majority would unleash after all these years.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Today, for the very first time, this Court holds that Congress violated the Constitution by authorizing a federal agency to adjudicate a statutory right that inheres in the &nbsp;Government in its sovereign capacity, also known as a public right.  According to the majority, the Constitution requires the Government to seek civil penalties for federal-securities fraud before a jury in federal court.  The nature of the remedy is, in the majority’s view, virtually dispositive.  That is plainly wrong.  This Court has held, without exception, that Congress has broad latitude to create statutory obligations that entitle the Government to civil penalties, and then to assign their enforcement outside the regular courts of law where there are no juries.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Beyond the majority’s legal errors, its ruling reveals a far more fundamental problem: This Court’s repeated failure to appreciate that its decisions can threaten the separation of powers.  Here, that threat comes from the Court’s mistaken conclusion that Congress cannot assign a certain public-rights matter for initial adjudication to the Executive because it must come only to the Judiciary.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The majority today upends longstanding precedent and the established practice of its coequal partners in our tripartite system of Government.  Because the Court fails to act as a neutral umpire when it rewrites established rules in the manner it does today, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">I</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The story of this case is straightforward.  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or Commission) investigated respondents George Jarkesy and his advisory firm Patriot28, LLC, for alleged violations of federal-securities laws in connection with the launch of two hedge funds.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In deciding how and where to enforce these laws, the SEC could have filed suit in federal court or adjudicated the matter in an administrative enforcement action subject to judicial review.  See <a aria-label=\"15 USC\" href=\"/uscode/text/15\">15</a> U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §§<a aria-label=\"15 USC 77h 1\" href=\"/uscode/text/15/77h-1\">77h–1</a>, <a aria-label=\"15 USC 77t\" href=\"/uscode/text/15/77t\">77t</a>, <a aria-label=\"15 USC 78u\" href=\"/uscode/text/15/78u\">78u</a>, <a aria-label=\"15 USC 78u 2\" href=\"/uscode/text/15/78u-2\">78u–2</a>, <a aria-label=\"15 USC 78u 3\" href=\"/uscode/text/15/78u-3\">78u–3</a>, <a aria-label=\"15 USC 80b 3\" href=\"/uscode/text/15/80b-3\">80b–3</a>, <a aria-label=\"15 USC 80b 9\" href=\"/uscode/text/15/80b-9\">80b–9</a>. <em> </em>The SEC opted for the latter.  In 2013, the SEC initiated an administrative enforcement action against respondents, alleging violations of the Securities &nbsp;Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Specifically, the SEC alleged that respondents falsely told brokers and investors that: (1) a prominent accounting firm would audit the hedge funds; (2) a prominent investment bank would serve as the funds’ prime broker; and (3) one of the funds would invest 50% of its capital in certain life-insurance policies.  In reality, the audit never took place, the bank never opened a prime brokerage account, and the hedge fund invested less than 20% of its capital in the life-insurance policies.  In addition to misrepresenting the funds’ investment strategies, respondents allegedly overvalued the funds’ holdings to charge higher management fees.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The SEC assigned the action to one of its administrative law judges, who held an evidentiary hearing and issued a lengthy initial decision, concluding that respondents in fact had violated the three securities laws.  The full Commission reviewed the initial decision and reached the same determination.  The Commission also denied respondents’ constitutional challenges to the order, including that the agency’s in-house adjudication violated respondents’ <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> right to a jury trial in federal court.  Ultimately, the SEC ordered respondents to pay a civil penalty of $300,000 and to cease and desist from violating the federal-securities laws.

The panel held, over the dissent of Judge Davis, that respondents were entitled to a jury trial in federal court under the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> because the federal-securities antifraud provisions were similar to common-law fraud claims to which the jury-trial right would attach.  See <em>id.</em>, at 451–459.  Because the SEC forced respondents to proceed within the agency, the &nbsp;Court of Appeals held that the SEC violated respondents’ <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> rights and thus vacated the SEC’s order.  <em>Id.</em>, at 465–466.<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Sotomayor Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-1\" id=\"DISSENT_6-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The majority affirms the Fifth Circuit’s decision, notwithstanding the mountain of precedent against it.

This Court’s longstanding precedent and established government practice uniformly support the constitutionality of administrative schemes like the SEC’s: agency adjudications of statutory claims for civil penalties brought by the Government in its sovereign capacity.  See Part II–B (<em>infra</em>, at 7–14).  In assessing the constitutionality of such adjudications, the political branches’ “&nbsp;‘[l]ong settled and established practice,’&nbsp;” which this Court has upheld and reaffirmed time and again, is entitled to “&nbsp;‘great weight.’&nbsp;”  <em>Chiafalo</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a aria-label=\"591 U.

One is the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a>, which “preserve[s]” the “right of trial by jury” in “Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars.”  The other is Article III’s Vesting Clause, which provides that the “judicial Power of the United States .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall be vested” in federal Article III courts.  This case presents the familiar interplay between these two provisions.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Although this case involves a <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> challenge, the principal question at issue is one rooted in Article III and the separation of powers.  That is because, as the majority rightly acknowledges, the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a>’s jury-trial right “applies” only in “an Article III court.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 7.  That conclusion follows from both the text of the Constitution and this Court’s precedents.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> As to the text, the Amendment is limited to “Suits at common law.”  That means two things.  First, that the right applies only in judicial proceedings.  The term “suit,” after all, refers to “the prosecution of some demand in a Court of justice,” <em>Cohens</em> v. <em>Virginia</em>, 6 Wheat. 264, 407 (1821) (Marshall, C.&nbsp;J.), or a “proceeding in a court of justice,” <em>Weston</em> v. <em>City Council of Charleston</em>, 2 Pet. 449, 464 (1829) (same) (“The modes of proceeding may be various, but if a right is litigated between parties in a court of justice, the proceeding by which the decision of the court is sought, is a suit”).  Consistent with that understanding, this Court has held repeatedly that “the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> is not applicable to administrative proceedings.”  <em>Tull</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"481 U. S. 412\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/481/412\">481 U.&nbsp;S. 412</a>, 418, n. 4 (1987); accord, <em>Atlas Roofing</em>, 430 U.&nbsp;S., at 454–455; <em>Curtis</em> v. <em>Loether</em>, <a aria-label=\"415 U. S. 189\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/415/189\">415 U.&nbsp;S. 189</a>, 195 (1974).  Factfinding by a jury is “incompatible with the whole concept of administrative adjudication,” which empowers executive officials to find the relevant facts and apply the law to &nbsp;those facts like juries do in a courtroom.  <em>Pernell</em> v. <em>Southall Realty</em>, <a aria-label=\"416 U. S. 363\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/416/363\">416 U.&nbsp;S. 363</a>, 383 (1974) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Second, the requirement that the “&nbsp;‘[s]uit’&nbsp;” must be one “&nbsp;‘at common law’&nbsp;” means that the claim at issue must be “&nbsp;‘legal in nature.’&nbsp;”  <em>Ante,</em> at 8. <em> </em>So, whether a defendant is entitled to a jury under the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> depends on both the forum and the cause of action.  If the claim is in an Article III proceeding, then the right to a jury attaches if the claim is “legal in nature” and the amount in controversy exceeds $20.  <em>Granfinanciera, S. A.</em> v. <em>Nordberg</em>, <a aria-label=\"492 U. S. 33\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/492/33\">492 U.&nbsp;S. 33</a>, 53 (1989); <em>Atlas Roofing</em>, 430 U.&nbsp;S., at 454, n.&nbsp;12, 461, n.&nbsp;16.  Yet when, as here, the claim proceeds in a non-Article III forum, the relevant question becomes whether “Congress properly assign[ed the] matter” for decision to that forum consistent with Article III and the separation of powers.  <em>Oil States Energy Services, LLC</em> v. <em>Greene’s Energy Group, LLC</em>, <a aria-label=\"584 U. S. 325\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/584/325\">584 U.&nbsp;S. 325</a>, 345 (2018).  In other words, the question is whether Congress improperly bestowed federal judicial power on a non-Article III forum.  See <em>id</em>., at 334 (Congress cannot “&nbsp;‘confer the Government’s “judicial Power” on entities outside Article III’&nbsp;” (quoting <em>Stern</em> v. <em>Marshall</em>, <a aria-label=\"564 U. S. 462\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/564/462\">564 U.&nbsp;S. 462</a>, 484 (2011))).<a aria-label=\"reference 2 of Sotomayor Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-2\" id=\"DISSENT_6-2ref\"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The conclusion that Congress properly assigned a matter to an agency for adjudication therefore necessarily “resolves [any] <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> challenge.”  <em>Oil States</em>, 584 U.&nbsp;S., at 345 (explaining that if non-Article III adjudication &nbsp;is permissible, then “&nbsp;‘the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> poses no independent bar to the adjudication of that action by a nonjury factfinder’&nbsp;” (quoting <em>Granfinanciera</em>, 492 U.&nbsp;S., at 53–54)); see W. Baude, Adjudication Outside Article III, 133 Harv. L.&nbsp;Rev. 1511, 1571 (2020) (“The Article III analysis should be conducted first, on its own.  And then .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if the non-Article III adjudication is permissible, the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> should be ignored”).  When executive power is at stake, Congress does not violate Article III or the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> by authorizing a nonjury factfinder to adjudicate the dispute.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> So, the critical issue in this type of case is whether Congress can assign a particular matter to a non-Article III factfinder.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> For more than a century and a half, this Court has answered that Article III question by pointing to the distinction between “private rights” and “public rights.”  See <em>Murray’s Lessee</em> v. <em>Hoboken Land &amp; Improvement Co.</em>, 18 How. 272, 284 (1856) (recognizing public-rights exception).  The distinction is helpful because public rights always can be assigned outside of Article III.  They “&nbsp;‘do not require judicial determination’&nbsp;” under the Constitution, even if they “&nbsp;‘are susceptible of it.’&nbsp;”  <em>Crowell</em> v. <em>Benson</em>, <a aria-label=\"285 U. S. 22\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/285/22\">285 U.&nbsp;S. 22</a>, 50 (1932) (quoting<em> Ex parte Bakelite Corp.</em>, <a aria-label=\"279 U. S. 438\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/279/438\">279 U.&nbsp;S. 438</a>, 451 (1929)).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The majority says that aspects of the public-rights doctrine have been confusing.  See <em>ante,</em> at 17. <em> </em>That might be true for cases involving wholly private disputes, but not for cases where the Government is a party.<a aria-label=\"reference 3 of Sotomayor Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-3\" id=\"DISSENT_6-3ref\"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></a>  It has long been &nbsp;settled and undisputed that, at a minimum, a matter of public rights arises “between the government and persons subject to its authority in connection with the performance of the constitutional functions of the executive or legislative departments.”  <em>Crowell</em>, 285 U.&nbsp;S., at 50; <em>Oil States</em>, 584 U.&nbsp;S., at 335 (describing the “Court’s longstanding formulation of the public-rights doctrine”); accord, <em>Granfinanciera</em>, 492 U.&nbsp;S., at 51, and n.&nbsp;8;<em> Atlas Roofing</em>, 430 U.&nbsp;S., at 452, 457; <em>Ex&nbsp;parte Bakelite Corp.</em>, 279 U.&nbsp;S., at 451.  Indeed, “from the time the doctrine of public rights was born, in 1856,” everyone understood that public rights “&nbsp;‘arise “between the government and others,”&nbsp;’&nbsp;” and refer to “rights <em>of the public</em>—that is, rights pertaining to claims brought by or against the United States.”  <em>Granfinanciera</em>, 492 U.&nbsp;S., at 68–69 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); see <em>ibid.</em> (collecting sources).  So, while this Court has recognized public rights in certain disputes between private parties, see <em>infra</em>, at 19–20, the doctrine’s heartland consists of claims belonging to the Government.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> When a claim belongs to the Government as sovereign, the Constitution permits Congress to enact new statutory obligations, prescribe consequences for the breach of those obligations, and then empower federal agencies to adjudicate such violations and impose the appropriate penalty.  See <em>Atlas Roofing</em>, 430 U.&nbsp;S., at 450–455 (collecting cases).<a aria-label=\"reference 4 of Sotomayor Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-4\" id=\"DISSENT_6-4ref\"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup></a>  &nbsp;This Court has repeatedly emphasized these unifying principles through an unbroken series of cases over almost 200 years.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">1</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Start at the beginning, with <em>Murray’s Lessee</em> in 1856.  In that case, the Government issued a warrant to compel a federal customs collector to produce public funds that the Government determined the collector had unlawfully withheld.  See 18 How., at 274–275.  The Government executed the warrant to seize and sell a plot of the collector’s land to make up for the withheld funds.  See <em>id.</em>, at 274. <em> </em>In upholding the sale of the seized property, this Court concluded that the Government’s in-house assessment and collection of taxes and penalties based on a federal official’s adjudication of the facts did not violate Article III.  The scheme was &nbsp;constitutional, the Court said, because “public rights” were at issue.  <em>Id</em>., at 284.  In other words, the dispute arose between the Government and the customs collector in connection with the Government’s exercise of its constitutional power to collect revenue.  Congress could have brought such claims, if it wanted, “within the cognizance of the courts of the United States, as it may deem proper.”  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Court thus endorsed that constitutional balance: Congress could decide whether to assign a public-rights dispute to the Executive for initial adjudication subject to judicial review or to an Article III federal court for resolution.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Fast forward half a century.  In <em>Oceanic Steam Nav. Co. </em>v.<em> Stranahan</em>, <a aria-label=\"214 U. S. 320\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/214/320\">214 U.&nbsp;S. 320</a>, 338–340 (1909), the Court upheld a customs official’s imposition of a penalty on a steamship company that violated immigration laws barring the entry of certain classes of people into the country.  The customs official determined the facts, adjudicated the violation, and enforced the statutory prohibition on immigration through the assessment of a monetary penalty.  See <em>id</em>., at 329.  The Court noted the breadth of Congress’s immigration power and held that the civil-penalty statutory scheme at issue was “beyond all question constitutional.”  <em>Id</em>., at 342.  Yet, far from restricting the public-rights doctrine to this particular exercise of congressional power or to specific prerogatives, the <em>Stranahan </em>Court went out of its way to explain that the “settled judicial construction” that civil-penalty claims brought by the Government could be assigned to the Executive for initial adjudication extended “not only as to tariff, but as to internal revenue, taxation, and other subjects,” including the regulation of foreign commerce.  <em>Id</em>., at 339; see also <em>id</em>., at 334–335.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Importantly, <em>Stranahan</em> rejected the “proposition” that, in “cases of penalty or punishment, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. enforcement must depend upon the exertion of judicial power, either by civil or criminal process.”  <em>Id</em>., at 338. <em> </em>In words that could have &nbsp;been written in response to today’s ruling, the Court explained that such a “proposition magnifies the judicial to the detriment of all other departments of the Government, disregards many previous adjudications of this court, and ignores practices often manifested and hitherto deemed to be free from any possible constitutional question.”  <em>Ibid.</em>  For that reason, the validity of legislation authorizing the non-Article III adjudication of civil-penalty claims does not turn on the Judiciary’s assessment of whether it is necessary for executive officials “to enforce designated penalties without resort to the courts.”  <em>Id</em>., at 339.  Whether or not such legislation violates Article III depends on whether Congress acted pursuant to a “grant of power made by the Constitution,” and not on whether it “relate[s] to subjects peculiarly within the authority of the legislative department of the Government” or on the circumstances that might have “caused Congress to exert a specified power.”  <em>Id</em>., at 339–340.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> By the time <em>Stranahan </em>was decided, Congress already routinely “impose[d] appropriate obligations and sanction[ed] their enforcement by reasonable money penalties, giving to executive officers the power to enforce such penalties without the necessity of invoking the judicial power.”  <em>Id</em>., at 339.  Far from limiting the public-rights doctrine to the particular context in <em>Stranahan </em>and prior cases, this Court has expressly rejected the notion that the public-rights doctrine is so confined.  See <em>infra</em>, at 18–19. <em> </em>This Court has repeatedly approved Congress’s assignment of public rights to agencies in diverse areas of the law, reflecting Congress’s varied constitutional powers.<a aria-label=\"reference 5 of Sotomayor Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-5\" id=\"DISSENT_6-5ref\"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup></a>  A nonexhaustive list includes “interstate and foreign commerce, taxation, immigration, the public lands, public health, the &nbsp;facilities of the post office, pensions, and payments to veterans,” <em>Crowell</em>, 285 U.&nbsp;S., at 51, and n.&nbsp;13 (collecting cases); see also, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Helvering</em> v. <em>Mitchell</em>, <a aria-label=\"303 U.

That is because, in every case where the Government has acted in its sovereign capacity to enforce a new statutory obligation through the administrative imposition of civil penalties or fines, this Court, without exception, has sustained the statutory scheme authorizing that enforcement outside of Article III.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">2</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> A unanimous Court made this exact point nearly half a century ago in <em>Atlas Roofing</em>.  That was<em> </em>the last time this Court considered a public-rights case where the constitutionality of an in-house adjudication of statutory claims brought by the Government was at issue.  That case presented the same question as this one: Whether the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> permits Congress to commit the adjudication of a new cause of action for civil penalties to an administrative agency.  430 U.&nbsp;S., at 444.  The Court said it did.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; In <em>Atlas Roofing</em>, the Court explained how Congress identified a national problem, concluded that existing legal remedies were inadequate to address it, and then created a new statutory scheme that endorsed Executive in-house enforcement as a solution.  Specifically, Congress found “that work-related deaths and injuries had become a ‘drastic’ national problem,” and that existing causes of action, including tort actions for negligence and wrongful death, did not adequately “protect the employee population from death and injury due to unsafe working conditions.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 444–445.  In response, Congress enacted the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHA) to require employers “to avoid maintaining unsafe or unhealthy working conditions.”  <em>Id</em>., at 445. <em> </em>OSHA in turn “empower[ed] the Secretary of Labor to promulgate health and safety standards,” and the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission to impose civil penalties on employers maintaining unsafe working conditions, regardless of whether any worker was in fact injured or killed.  <em>Id.</em>, at 445–446.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Two employers that had been assessed civil penalties for OSHA violations resulting in the death of employees challenged the constitutionality of the statute’s enforcement procedures.  They observed that “a suit in a federal court by the Government for civil penalties for violation of a statute is a suit for a money judgment[,] which is classically a suit at common law.”  <em>Id</em>., at 449.  Therefore, the employers claimed, the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> right to a jury attached and Congress could not assign the matter to an agency for resolution.  See <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This Court upheld OSHA’s statutory scheme.  It relied on the long history of public-rights cases endorsing Congress’s now-settled practice of assigning the Government’s rights to civil penalties for violations of a statutory obligation to in-house adjudication in the first instance.  See <em>id</em>., at 450–455.  In light of this “history and our cases,” the Court con&nbsp;cluded that, where Congress “create[s] a new cause of action, and remedies therefor, unknown to the common law,” it is free to “plac[e] their enforcement in a tribunal supplying speedy and expert resolutions of the issues involved.”  <em>Id</em>., at 460–461.  “That is the case even if the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> would have required a jury where the adjudication of those rights is assigned to a federal court of law.”  <em>Id</em>., at 455; see <em>id</em>., at 461, n.&nbsp;16.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The “new rule” and “legally unsound principle” that the majority accuses this dissent of “unfurl[ing]” today, <em>ante,</em> at 17–18, n. 2, is the one that this Court declared “&nbsp;‘settled judicial construction’ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ‘from the beginning’&nbsp;”: “[T]he Government could commit the enforcement of statutes and the imposition and collection of fines .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for administrative enforcement, without judicial trials,” even if the same action would have required a jury trial if committed to an Article III court.  <em>Atlas Roofing</em>,  430 U.&nbsp;S., at 460 (collecting cases); accord, <em>Elting</em>, 287 U.&nbsp;S., at 334 (Congress “may lawfully impose appropriate obligations, sanction their enforcement by reasonable money penalties, and invest in administrative officials the power to impose and enforce them”); <em>Stranahan</em>, 214 U.&nbsp;S., at 339 (Congress may “impose appropriate obligations and sanction their enforcement by reasonable money penalties, giving to executive officers the power to enforce such penalties without the necessity of invoking the judicial power”).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">C</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> It should be obvious by now how this case should have been resolved under a faithful and straightforward application of <em>Atlas Roofing</em> and a long line of<em> </em>this Court’s precedents.  The constitutional question is indistinguishable.  The majority instead wishes away <em>Atlas Roofing</em> by burying it at the end of its opinion and minimizing the unbroken line of cases on which <em>Atlas Roofing </em>relied.  That approach &nbsp;to precedent significantly undermines this Court’s commitment to <em>stare decisis</em> and the rule of law.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This case may involve a different statute from <em>Atlas Roofing</em>, but the schemes are remarkably similar. <em> </em>Here, just as in <em>Atlas Roofing</em>, Congress identified a problem; concluded that the existing remedies were inadequate; and enacted a new regulatory scheme as a solution.  The problem was a lack of transparency and accountability in the securities market that contributed to the Great Depression of the 1930s.  See <em>ante,</em> at 1.  The inadequate remedies were the then-existing state statutory and common-law fraud causes of action.  The solution was a comprehensive federal scheme of securities regulation consisting of the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  See <em>ibid.</em>  In particular, Congress enacted these securities laws to ensure “full disclosure” and promote ethical business practices “in the securities industry,” <em>SEC</em> v. <em>Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"375 U. S. 180\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/375/180\">375 U.&nbsp;S. 180</a>, 186 (1963), as well as to “protect investors against manipulation of stock prices,” <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst</em> v. <em>Hochfelder</em>, <a aria-label=\"425 U. S. 185\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/425/185\">425 U.&nbsp;S. 185</a>, 195 (1976).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The prophylactic nature of the statutory regime also is virtually indistinguishable from the OSHA scheme at issue in <em>Atlas Roofing</em>.  Among other things, these securities laws prohibit the misrepresentation or concealment of various material facts through the imposition of federal registration and disclosure requirements.  See <em>ante,</em> at 2.  Critically, federal-securities laws do not require proof of actual reliance on an investor’s misrepresentations or that an “investor has actually suffered financial loss.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 4; see also <em>SEC </em>v. <em>Life Partners Holdings, Inc.</em> <a href=\"/rio/citation/854_F.3d_765\">854 F.&nbsp;3d 765</a>, 779 (CA5 2017); <em>SEC</em> v. <em>Blavin</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/760_F.2d_706\">760 F. 2d 706</a>, 711 (CA6 1985) (<em>per curiam</em>).  OSHA too prohibits conduct that could, but does not necessarily, injure a private person.  <em>Atlas Roofing</em>, 430 U.&nbsp;S., at 445 (OSHA remedies “exis[t] whether or not an employee is &nbsp;actually injured or killed as a result of the [unsafe or unhealthy working] condition”).  The employer’s failure to maintain safe and healthy working conditions violates OSHA even if there is no actionable harm to an employee, just as a misrepresentation to investors in connection with the buying or selling of securities violates federal-securities law even if there is no actual injury to the investors.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Moreover, both here and in <em>Atlas Roofing</em>, Congress empowered the Government to institute administrative enforcement proceedings to adjudicate potential violations of federal law and impose civil penalties on a private party for those violations, all while making the final agency decision subject to judicial review.  In bringing a securities claim, the SEC seeks redress for a “violation” that “is committed against the United States rather than an aggrieved individual,” which “is why, for example, a securities-enforcement action may proceed even if victims do not support or are not parties to the prosecution.”  <em>Kokesh</em> v. <em>SEC</em>, <a aria-label=\"581 U. S. 455\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/581/455\">581 U.&nbsp;S. 455</a>, 463 (2017).  Put differently, the SEC seeks to “&nbsp;‘remedy harm to the public at large’&nbsp;” for violation of the Government’s rights. <em> Ibid. </em> The Government likewise seeks to remedy a public harm when it enforces OSHA’s prohibition of unsafe working conditions.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Ultimately, both cases arise between the Government and others in connection with the performance of the Government’s constitutional functions, and involve the Government acting in its sovereign capacity to bring a statutory claim on behalf of the United States in order to vindicate the public interest.  They both involve, as <em>Atlas Roofing </em>put it, “new cause[s] of action, and remedies therefor, unknown to the common law.”  430 U.&nbsp;S., at 461.  Neither Article III nor the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> prohibits Congress from assigning the enforcement of these new “Governmen[t] rights to civil penalties” to non-Article III adjudicators, and thus “supplying speedy and expert resolutions of the issues involved.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 450, 461.  In a world where precedent means &nbsp;something, this should end the case.  Yet here it does not.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">III</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The practice of assigning the Government’s right to civil penalties for statutory violations to non-Article III adjudication had been so settled that it become an undisputable reality of how “our Government has actually worked.”  <em>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</em>, 601 U.&nbsp;S., at 445 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Kagan</span>, J., concurring).  That is why the Court has had no cause to address this kind of constitutional challenge since its unanimous decision in <em>Atlas Roofing</em>.  The majority takes a wrecking ball to this settled law and stable government practice.  To do so, it misreads this Court’s precedents, ignores those that do not suit its thesis, and advances distinctions created from whole cloth.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The majority’s treatment of the public-rights doctrine is not only incomplete, but is gerrymandered to produce today’s result.  See Part III–A (<em>infra</em>, at 17–21).  Unable to explain that doctrine, the majority effectively ignores the Article III threshold question to focus instead on two <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> cases: <em>Tull</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"481 U.S. 412\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/481/412\">481 U.&nbsp;S. 412 (1987)</a>, and <em>Granfinanciera, S. A.</em> v. <em>Nordberg</em>, <a aria-label=\"492 U.S. 33\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/492/33\">492 U.&nbsp;S. 33 (1989)</a>.  Neither involved the in-house adjudication of statutory claims brought by the Government pursuant to its sovereign powers, which is the critical fact under this Court’s precedent.  See Part III–B–1 (<em>infra</em>, at<em> </em>22–24) (discussing <em>Tull</em>); Part III–B–2 (<em>infra</em>, at<em> </em>24–29) (discussing <em>Granfinanciera</em>).  The majority and the concurrence then predictably fail to distinguish <em>Atlas Roofing</em>, which resolved the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> question for cases like this one implicating that critical fact.  See Part III–C (<em>infra</em>, at 29–32).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">A</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> To start, it is almost impossible to discern how the majority defines a public right and whether its view of the doctrine is consistent with this Court’s public-rights cases.  The &nbsp;majority at times seems to limit the public-rights exception to areas of its own choosing.  It points out, for example, that some public-rights cases involved the collection of revenue, customs law, and immigration law, see <em>ante</em>, at 14–17,<em> </em>and that <em>Atlas Roofing </em>involved OSHA and not “civil penalty suits for fraud,” <em>ante</em>, at 22.<a aria-label=\"reference 6 of Sotomayor Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-6\" id=\"DISSENT_6-6ref\"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup></a> <em> </em>Other times, the majority highlights a particular practice predating the founding, such as the “unbroken tradition” in <em>Murray’s Lessee</em> of executive officials issuing warrants of distress to collect revenue.  <em>Ante</em>, at 15; see also <em>ante</em>, at 13–14 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Gorsuch</span>, J., concurring). <em> </em>Needless to say, none of these explanations for the doctrine is satisfactory.  What is the legal principle behind saying only these areas and no further?  This Court has rejected that kind of arbitrary line-drawing in cases like <em>Stranahan </em>and <em>Atlas Roofing</em>. <em> </em>How does the requirement of a historical practice dating back to the founding, or “flow[ing] from centuries-old rules,” <em>ante</em>, at 17, account for the broad universe of public-rights cases in the United States Reporter?  The majority does not say.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The majority’s only other theory fares no better.  The majority seems to suggest that a common thread underlying these cases is that “the political branches had traditionally held exclusive power over th[ese] field[s] and had exercised it.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 16–17. <em> </em>To the extent the majority thinks this is a distinction, it fails for at least two reasons.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> First, <em>Atlas Roofing </em>expressly rejected the argument that the public-rights doctrine is limited to particular exercises of congressional power.  The employers in <em>Atlas Roofing</em> argued “that cases such as <em>Murray’s Lessee</em>, <em>Elting</em>, [<em>Stranahan</em>], <em>Phillips</em>, and <em>Helvering </em>all deal with the exercise of sovereign powers that are inherently in the exclusive do&nbsp;main of the Federal Government and critical to its very existence—the power over immigration, the importation of goods, and taxation.”  430 U.&nbsp;S., at 456.  Cabining the cases in that way, the employers argued that “[t]he theory of those cases is inapplicable where the Government exercises other powers that [they] regard[ed] as less fundamental, less exclusive, and less vital to the existence of the Nation, such as the power to regulate commerce among the several States, the latter being the power Congress sought to exercise in enacting [OSHA].”  <em>Ibid.  </em>The Court rejected the employers’ argument, explaining that nothing in those cases turned on those particular exercises of the Government’s authority.  See <em>id</em>., at 456–457; cf. <em>Crowell</em>, 285 U.&nbsp;S., at 51 (offering a list of “[f]amiliar illustrations of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. exercise[s]” of Congress’s constitutional authority that have fallen within the public-rights exception to Article III).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Second, even if <em>Atlas Roofing</em> had not explicitly rejected the  proposed distinction here, the majority cannot reconcile its restrictive view of the public-rights doctrine with <em>Atlas Roofing </em>and other precedents.  For example, it is unclear how OSHA, or the National Labor Relations Act at issue in <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin</em>, would fit the majority’s view of the public-rights doctrine, or why the exercise of interstate-commerce power to enact those statutes would be any different from the exercise of that same power to enact the federal-securities laws at issue here.  See <em>Atlas Roofing</em>, 430 U.&nbsp;S., at 457 (“It is also apparent that <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin</em>, <em>Pernell</em>, and <em>Curtis </em>are not amenable to the limitations suggested by [the employers]”).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"><em> </em>The majority’s description of the doctrine also fails to account for public rights that do not belong to the Federal Government in its sovereign capacity.  See <em>Granfinanciera</em>, 492 U.&nbsp;S., at 54 (“[T]he Federal Government need not be a party for a case to revolve around ‘public rights’&nbsp;”).  This Court, after all, has rejected the confinement of public rights to that heartland.  See <em>ibid.</em> (“[W]e [have] rejected the &nbsp;view that ‘a matter of public rights must at a minimum arise “between the government and others”&nbsp;’&nbsp;”).<em> </em> Conspicuously absent from the majority’s discussion are, for example, cases in which this Court held that Congress could assign a private federally created action that was “closely integrated into a public regulatory scheme” for adjudication in a non-Article III forum.  <em>Thomas</em> v. <em>Union Carbide Agricultural Products Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"473 U. S. 568\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/473/568\">473 U.&nbsp;S. 568</a>, 594 (1985).  These cases include, for example, an agency’s adjudication of state-law counterclaims to an investor’s federal action against its broker, <em>Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n</em> v. <em>Schor</em>, <a aria-label=\"478 U. S. 833\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/478/833\">478 U.&nbsp;S. 833</a>, 835–836, 847–850 (1986), and the arbitration of data-compensation disputes among participants in the Environmental Protection Agency’s pesticide registration scheme, <em>Thomas</em>,<em> </em>473 U.&nbsp;S., at 571, 589–592.  Both <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Schor </em>thus upheld the non-Article III adjudication of disputes between private parties, which naturally did not involve the Government in its sovereign capacity.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Even accepting the majority’s public-rights-are-confusing defense, its “strategy for dealing with the confusion is not to offer a theory for rationalizing this body of law,” but to provide an incomplete and unprincipled account of the doctrine.  <em>Haaland</em> v. <em>Brackeen</em>, <a aria-label=\"599 U. S. 255\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/599/255\">599 U.&nbsp;S. 255</a>, 279 (2023).  The majority references, but does not explain, “distinctions our cases have drawn,” <em>ante</em>, at 18, n. 2, also cherry-picking some cases and ignoring others.  Indeed, in lieu of a coherent theory, all the majority has to offer is a list of five “historic categories of adjudications [that] fall within the exception,” <em>ante</em>, at 14–17,<em> </em>and maybe (just maybe) OSHA, which the majority reluctantly adds to the mix at the end of its opinion for good measure, see <em>ante</em>, at 22–24.  The majority ignores countless public-rights cases and entire strands of the doctrine, and fails to heed its own admonition that “close attention” must be paid “to the basis for each asserted &nbsp;application of the doctrine.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 17.<a aria-label=\"reference 7 of Sotomayor Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-7\" id=\"DISSENT_6-7ref\"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The majority also attacks a strawman when it asserts that “precedents foreclose th[e] argument” that the public-rights doctrine “applies whenever a statute increases governmental efficiency.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 26; see also <em>ante,</em> at 19 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Gorsuch</span>, J., concurring). <em> </em>No one has made that argument in this case; not the Government and certainly not this dissent.  The fact that certain rights might be susceptible to speedy and expert resolution through non-Article III adjudication is not what makes them “rights <em>of the public</em>—that is, rights pertaining to claims brought by or against the United States.”  <em>Granfinanciera</em>, 492 U.&nbsp;S., at 68–69 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> It is not clear what else, if anything, might qualify as a public right, or what is even left of the doctrine after today’s opinion.  Rather than recognize the long-settled principle that a statutory right belonging to the Government in its sovereign capacity falls within the public-rights exception to Article III, the majority opts for a “we know it when we see it” formulation.  This Court’s precedents and our coequal branches of Government deserve better.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Rather than relying on <em>Atlas Roofing </em>or the relevant public-rights cases, the majority instead purports to follow <em>Tull </em>and <em>Granfinanciera</em>.  The former involved a suit in federal court and the latter involved a dispute between private parties.  So, just like that, the majority ventures off on the wrong path.   Indeed, as explained below, both the majority and the concurrence miss the critical distinction drawn in &nbsp;this Court’s precedents between the non-Article III adjudication of public-rights matters involving the liability of one individual to another and those involving claims belonging to the Government in its sovereign capacity.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> According to the majority, respondents are entitled to a jury trial in federal court because, as here, <em>Tull</em> involved a Government claim for civil penalties, and <em>Granfinanciera</em> looked to the common law to determine if a statutory cause of action was legal in nature. <em> </em>By focusing on the remedy in this case, and the perceived similarities between the statutory cause of action and a common-law analogue, the majority elides the critical distinction between those cases and this one: Whether Congress assigned the Government’s sovereign rights to civil penalties to a non-Article III factfinder for adjudication.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">1</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The majority bafflingly proclaims that “the remedy is all but dispositive” in this case, <em>ante,</em> at 9, ignoring that <em>Atlas Roofing</em> and countless precedents before it rejected that proposition.  Not content to take just a page from the employers’ challenge in <em>Atlas Roofing</em>, the majority has taken their whole brief, resuscitating yet another theory that this Court has long foreclosed.  The employers in <em>Atlas Roofing</em> argued that the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> prohibited Congress from assigning to an agency the same remedy at issue here: civil penalties.  See 430 U.&nbsp;S., at 450 (“Petitioners .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. claim that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. assign[ing] the function of adjudicating the Government’s rights to civil penalties for [a statutory] violation .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. deprive[s] a defendant of his <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> jury right”).  This Court rejected that argument outright, citing a long line of cases involving the Executive’s adjudication of statutory claims for civil penalties brought by the Government in its sovereign capacity.  <em>Id.</em>, at 450–455 (collecting cases).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; As discussed above, this Court has long endorsed statutory schemes authorizing agency adjudicators to find violations and award civil penalties to the Government. <em> </em>See <em>supra</em>, at 9–12.  Long before <em>Atlas Roofing</em>, this Court held that the Constitution permits Congress to enact statutory obligations and then “sanction their enforcement by reasonable money penalties” by government officials “without the necessity of invoking the judicial power.” <em> Stranahan</em>, 214 U.&nbsp;S., at 339; see <em>id</em>., at 338–339 (collecting cases). <em> </em>That the SEC imposed civil penalties on respondents therefore has little, if any, bearing on the resolution of this case.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Again, even if over a century of precedent did not foreclose the majority’s argument, it fails on its own terms.  The majority relies almost entirely on <em>Tull</em>, which held that<em> </em>statutory claims for civil penalties were “a type of remedy at common law” that entitled a defendant to a jury trial.  481 U.&nbsp;S., at 422; see <em>id</em>., at 425.  Critically, however, the <em>Tull </em>Court’s analysis took place in an entirely different context: federal court.  See <em>ante,</em> at 8–9 (“In [<em>Tull</em>], the Government sued a real estate developer for civil penalties [under the Clean Water Act] <em>in federal court</em>” (emphasis added)).  <em>Tull</em> did not present the question at issue in <em>Atlas Roofing</em> and other cases involving non-Article III adjudication of Government claims in the first instance.  Rather, <em>Tull </em>stands for the unremarkable proposition that, when the Government sues an entity for civil penalties in federal district court, the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> entitles the defendant “to a jury trial to determine his liability on the legal claims.”  481 U.&nbsp;S., at 425.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> That conclusion says nothing about the constitutionality of the SEC’s in-house adjudicative scheme.  <em>Atlas Roofing</em> and its predecessors could not have been clearer on this point: Congress can assign the enforcement of a statutory obligation for in-house adjudication to executive officials, “even if the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> would have required a jury where the adjudication of those rights is assigned to a &nbsp;federal court of law instead of an administrative agency.”  430 U.&nbsp;S., at 455.  Although “the Government could commit the enforcement of statutes and the imposition and collection of fines to the judiciary, in which event jury trial would be required,” the Government “could also validly opt for administrative enforcement, without judicial trials.”  <em>Id</em>., at 460 (citing <em>Stranahan</em>, 214 U.&nbsp;S., at 339; <em>Hepner</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"213 U.S. 103\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/213/103\">213 U.&nbsp;S. 103 (1909)</a>; <em>United States</em> v. <em>Regan</em>, <a aria-label=\"232 U.S. 37\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/232/37\">232 U.&nbsp;S. 37 (1914)</a>; <em>Helvering</em>, 303 U.&nbsp;S., at 402–403;<em> Crowell</em>, 285 U.&nbsp;S., at 50–51); <em>Curtis</em>, 415 U.&nbsp;S., at 195 (explaining that Congress can “entrust [the] enforcement of statutory rights to an administrative process .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. free from the strictures of the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a>,” but must abide by the Amendment when it does so “in an ordinary civil action in the district courts”).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> It would have been quite remarkable for <em>Tull</em>, which involved a claim in federal court, to overrule silently more than a century of caselaw involving non-Article III adjudications of the Government’s rights to civil penalties for statutory violations.  Of course, <em>Tull</em> did no such thing.  <em>Tull </em>even reaffirmed <em>Atlas Roofing</em> by emphasizing that the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> depends on the forum, not just the remedy, because it “is not applicable to administrative proceedings.”  481 U.&nbsp;S., at 418, n.&nbsp;4 (citing <em>Atlas Roofing</em>, 430 U.&nbsp;S., at 454; <em>Pernell</em>, 416 U.&nbsp;S., at 383). <em> </em>For the majority to pretend otherwise is wishful thinking at best.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">2</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The majority next argues that the “close relationship” between the federal-securities laws and common-law fraud “confirms that this action is ‘legal in nature,’&nbsp;” and entitles respondents to a jury trial.  <em>Ante,</em> at 13.  That argument does not fare any better than the argument on remedy.  Again, the majority bends inapposite case law to an illogical thesis.  <em>Granfinanciera</em>, on which the majority relies to make its cause-of-action argument, set forth the public-&nbsp;rights analysis only for “disputes to which the Federal Government is not a party in its sovereign capacity.”  492 U.&nbsp;S., at 55, n.&nbsp;10.  For cases that, as here, involve the Government in its sovereign capacity, the <em>Granfinanciera </em>Court plainly stated that “Congress may fashion causes of action that are closely <em>analogous</em> to common-law claims and [still] place them beyond the ambit of the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> by assigning their resolution to a [non-Article III] forum in which jury trials are unavailable.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 52 (citing <em>Atlas Roofing</em>, 430 U.&nbsp;S., at 450–461).<a aria-label=\"reference 8 of Sotomayor Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-8\" id=\"DISSENT_6-8ref\"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Court held in <em>Granfinanciera</em> that “a person who has not submitted a claim against a bankruptcy estate has a right to a jury trial when sued by the trustee in bankruptcy to recover an allegedly fraudulent monetary transfer.”  492 U.&nbsp;S., at 36. <em> </em>In doing so, the Court noted that actions to recover such transfers through a claim of fraudulent conveyance were traditionally available at common law.  See <em>id</em>., at 43–49. <em> </em>That did not resolve the case, however.  Unlike in <em>Tull</em>, the proceeding at issue in <em>Granfinanciera </em>was in a non-Article III forum (<em>i</em>.<em>e</em>., a bankruptcy court).  So, to answer whether Congress could assign the fraudulent-conveyance claim to a bankruptcy judge for decision, Congress needed to decide whether the “legal cause of action involve[d] ‘public rights.’&nbsp;”  492 U.&nbsp;S., at 53.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Granfinanciera </em>explains that there are two ways to identify a “public right.”  First, there are the matters in which Congress enacts a statutory cause of action that “inheres in, or lies against, the Federal Government in its sovereign capacity.”  <em>Id</em>., at 53 (citing <em>Atlas Roofing</em>, 430 U.&nbsp;S., at 458). <em> </em>These matters necessarily arise between the Government and the people in connection with the Government’s exercise of its constitutional authority.  See <em>supra,</em> at 7–8.  In these cases, the Court said, <em>Atlas Roofing</em> controls the public-rights analysis.  See <em>Granfinanciera</em>, 492 U.&nbsp;S., at 51, 53. <em> </em>The Court explained<em> </em>that “Congress may effectively supplant a common law cause of action carrying with it a right to a jury trial with a statutory cause of action shorn of a jury trial right if that statutory cause of action inheres in, or lies against, the Federal Government in its sovereign capacity.”  <em>Id</em>., at 53 (citing <em>Atlas Roofing</em>, 430 U.&nbsp;S., at 458).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The second kind of public right that <em>Granfinanciera </em>recognized involves “disputes to which the Federal Government is not a party in its sovereign capacity,” 492 U.&nbsp;S., at 55, n.&nbsp;10, that is, usually “[w]holly private” disputes, <em>id</em>., at 51.  The public-rights analysis in these private-dispute cases looks different: “The crucial question, <em>in cases not involving the Federal Government</em>, is whether ‘Congress, acting for a valid legislative purpose pursuant to its constitutional powers under Article I, has created a seemingly “private” right that is so closely integrated into a public regulatory scheme as to be a matter appropriate for agency resolution with limited involvement by the Article III judiciary.’&nbsp;”  <em>Id</em>., at 54 (quoting <em>Thomas</em>, 473 U.&nbsp;S., at 593–594; &nbsp;emphasis added; alterations omitted).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> These two approaches together stand for the proposition that “[i]f a statutory right is not closely intertwined with a federal regulatory program Congress has power to enact, <em>and</em> if that right neither belongs to nor exists against the Federal Government, then it must be adjudicated by an Article III court.”  492 U.&nbsp;S., at 54–55 (emphasis added).  Once in federal court, “[i]f the right is legal in nature, then it carries with it the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a>’s guarantee of a jury trial.”  <em>Id</em>., at 55.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Because <em>Granfinanciera </em>did not involve a statutory right that belonged to the Government in its sovereign capacity, <em>Atlas Roofing</em> did not control the outcome.  Instead, the Court applied the private-disputes test to determine whether fraudulent-conveyance “actions were ‘closely intertwined’ with the bankruptcy regime.”&nbsp; <em>Ante</em>, at 20 (quoting <em>Granfinanciera</em>, 492 U.&nbsp;S., at 54).<em> </em>The Court held that the fraudulent-conveyance actions “were not inseparable from the bankruptcy process,” and thus the public-rights exception did not apply.  <em>Ante</em>, at 20 (citing <em>Granfinanciera</em>, 492 U.&nbsp;S., at 54, 56).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"><em> </em>The majority brushes aside this critical distinction between <em>Atlas Roofing </em>and <em>Granfinanciera </em>in one sentence.  That “the Government is the party prosecuting this action,” the majority writes, is meaningless because this Court has “never held that the ‘presence of the United States as a proper party to the proceeding is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sufficient’ by itself to trigger the exception.”  <em>Ante</em>, at 22 (quoting <em>Northern Pipeline Constr. Co.</em> v. <em>Marathon Pipe Line Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"458 U. S. 50\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/458/50\">458 U.&nbsp;S. 50</a>, 69, n. 23 (1982) (plurality opinion)).  Here, too, the majority attacks a strawman.  The SEC does not claim that the mere presence of the United States as a proper party necessarily means that a public right is at issue.  See Reply Brief 8, n.&nbsp;2 (disclaiming this argument).<a aria-label=\"reference 9 of Sotomayor Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-9\" id=\"DISSENT_6-9ref\"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup></a>  Of course “what matters is &nbsp;the substance” of the claim.  <em>Ante</em>, at 21.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"><em> </em>By no means, though, does this case involve a “purely taxonomic change.”  <em>Granfinanciera</em>, 492 U.&nbsp;S., at 61.  Congress did not just repackage a common-law claim under a new label.  It created new statutory obligations and an entire federal scheme.  See <em>supra</em>, at 14–16.<a aria-label=\"reference 10 of Sotomayor Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-10\" id=\"DISSENT_6-10ref\"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup></a> <em> </em>Perhaps most importantly, Congress created a new right unknown to the common law that, unlike common-law fraud, belongs to the public and inheres in the Government in its sovereign capacity.  That is why, when the SEC seeks to enforce the federal-securities laws, it does so to remedy the harm to the United States.  See <em>supra</em>, at 16.  It seeks to protect the integrity of the securities market as a whole through the imposition of new and distinct remedies like civil penalties &nbsp;and orders barring violators from holding certain positions and performing certain activities in the industry.  See <a aria-label=\"15 USC\" href=\"/uscode/text/15\">15</a> U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §§<a aria-label=\"15 USC 77h\" href=\"/uscode/text/15/77h\">77h</a>–<a aria-label=\"15 USC 1\" href=\"/uscode/text/15/1\">1</a>(f&nbsp;), and (g), 78u–2, 78u–3(f&nbsp;).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> For these reasons, “[a]n action brought by an Executive Branch agency to enforce federal securities laws is not the same as an action brought by one individual against another for monetary or injunctive relief of the sort that law courts (with juries) in England or the States have traditionally heard.”  Brief for Professor John Golden et&nbsp;al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 3. <em> </em>Congress did not unlawfully “siphon” a traditional legal action “away from an Article III court” when it enacted the federal-securities laws and provided for their enforcement within the SEC.  <em>Ante,</em> at 21.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The majority asserts that “<em>Granfinanciera </em>effectively decides this case.”  <em>Ante</em>, at 20. <em> </em>That can only be true, though, if one ignores what <em>Granfinanciera</em> actually says: Its public-rights analysis of whether an action is closely intertwined with a federal regulatory program only applies “in cases not involving the Federal Government.”  492 U.&nbsp;S., at 54.  The analysis from <em>Atlas Roofing</em> controls where, as here, “&nbsp;‘the Government is involved in its sovereign capacity under an otherwise valid statute.’&nbsp;” <em> </em>492 U.&nbsp;S., at 51 (quoting <em>Atlas Roofing</em>, 430 U.&nbsp;S., at 458).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">C</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Both cases relied on by the majority, <em>Tull</em> and <em>Granfinanciera</em>, reaffirm that <em>Atlas Roofing </em>controls precisely in circumstances like the ones at issue in this case.  That is why the majority’s late-stage attempt to distinguish <em>Atlas Roofing</em> fails.  The majority’s principal argument that the OSHA scheme in <em>Atlas Roofing</em> “did not borrow its cause of action from the common law” and was instead a “self-consciously novel” scheme that “resembled a detailed building code,” <em>ante,</em> at 23–24, is flawed on multiple fronts.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> First, OSHA’s cause of action should be largely irrelevant under the majority’s view that the remedy of civil penalties &nbsp;is effectively dispositive under <em>Tull</em>.  <em>Atlas Roofing</em>, and many other cases involving non-Article III adjudications, also involved civil penalties designed to punish and deter, and yet the majority does not expressly disavow them.  Logically, then, either <em>Atlas Roofing </em>and countless other cases were wrongly decided, or the majority’s view on civil penalties is wrong.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Second, because the majority elides the critical distinction between <em>Atlas Roofing </em>and <em>Granfinanciera</em>, it fails to grapple with the fact that this case, like <em>Atlas Roofing </em>and unlike <em>Granfinanciera</em>, involves the Government acting in its sovereign capacity to enforce a statutory violation.  That makes the right at issue a “public right” that Congress can take outside the purview of Article III, even when the new cause of action is analogous to a common-law claim.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Third, the relationship between the federal-securities laws (including their antifraud provisions) and common-law fraud is materially indistinguishable from the relationship between OSHA and the common-law torts of wrongful death and negligence.  Unlike their common-law comparators, neither statute requires actionable harm to an individual.  See <em>supra</em>, at 15. <em> </em>In arguing that OSHA’s scheme was “self-consciously” novel in ways unknown to the common law, the majority points to the granularity of OSHA standards. <em> Ante,</em> at 23–24. <em> </em>Yet lawyers and regulated parties in the securities industry would be surprised to hear that this could be a distinguishing feature.  Anyone familiar with the industry knows securities laws are replete with specific and exceedingly detailed requirements implementing the statute’s disclosure and antifraud provisions.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <a aria-label=\"17 CFR\" href=\"/cfr/text/17\">17</a> CFR §275.206(4)–1(b) (2023) (prohibiting testimonials and endorsements that do not satisfy requirements without meeting complex disclosure requirements); §275.206(4)–2(a) (prohibiting investment advisers from having custody of client funds or securities unless specific requirements are &nbsp;met, including qualifications, notices, and account statements).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The majority further rests on the notion that Congress drew inspiration from the common law in enacting the antifraud provisions of the federal-securities laws, whereas OSHA’s new statutory duty did not bring any common-law soil with it.  See <em>ante,</em> at 23–24. <em> </em>Yet both statutes share elements with claims at common law that Congress deemed inadequate to address the national problems that prompted it to legislate.  See <em>supra</em>, at 14–15. <em> </em>Still, even accepting that federal-securities laws bring common-law soil with them and OSHA does not, the majority does not explain why that is a constitutionally relevant distinction.<a aria-label=\"reference 11 of Sotomayor Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-11\" id=\"DISSENT_6-11ref\"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In sum, all avenues by which the majority attempts to distinguish <em>Atlas Roofing </em>fail.  The majority cannot escape the entrenched principle that a “legal cause of action involves ‘public rights’&nbsp;” that can be taken outside of Article III if the “statutory right is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. closely intertwined with a federal regulatory program Congress has power to enact” <em>or</em> if it “belongs to [o]r exists against the Federal Government.”  <em>Granfinanciera</em>, 492 U.&nbsp;S., at 53–54.<a aria-label=\"reference 12 of Sotomayor Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-12\" id=\"DISSENT_6-12ref\"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup></a> <em> </em>In both <em>Atlas Roofing </em>and this case, a public right exists.  In both statutory &nbsp;schemes, regardless of any perceived resemblance to the common law, Congress enacted a new cause of action that created a statutory right belonging to the United States for the Government to enforce pursuant to its sovereign powers.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">IV</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> A faithful and straightforward application of this Court’s longstanding precedent should have resolved this case.  Faithful “[a]dherence to precedent is ‘a foundation stone of the rule of law.’&nbsp;” <em>Kisor</em> v. <em>Wilkie</em>, <a aria-label=\"588 U. S. 558\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/588/558\">588 U.&nbsp;S. 558</a>, 586 (2019) (quoting <em>Michigan</em> v. <em>Bay Mills Indian Community</em>, <a aria-label=\"572 U. S. 782\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/572/782\">572 U.&nbsp;S. 782</a>, 798 (2014)).  It allows courts to function, and be perceived, as courts, and not as political entities.  “&nbsp;‘It promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.’&nbsp;”  588 U.&nbsp;S., at 586–587 (quoting <em>Payne</em> v. <em>Tennessee</em>, <a aria-label=\"501 U. S. 808\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/501/808\">501 U.&nbsp;S. 808</a>, 827 (1991); alterations omitted).  That is why, “even in constitutional cases, a departure from precedent ‘demands special justification.’&nbsp;”  <em>Gamble</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"587 U. S. 678\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/587/678\">587 U.&nbsp;S. 678</a>, 691 (2019) (quoting <em>Arizona</em> v. <em>Rumsey</em>, <a aria-label=\"467 U. S. 203\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/467/203\">467 U.&nbsp;S. 203</a>, 212 (1984)).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Today’s decision disregards these foundational principles.<a aria-label=\"reference 13 of Sotomayor Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-13\" id=\"DISSENT_6-13ref\"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup></a>  Time will tell what is left of the public-rights doc&nbsp;trine.  Less uncertain, however, are the momentous consequences that flow from the majority’s insistence that the Government’s rights to civil penalties must now be tried before a jury in federal court.  The majority’s decision, which strikes down the SEC’s in-house adjudication of civil-penalty claims on the ground that such claims are legal in nature and entitle respondents to a federal jury, effects a seismic shift in this Court’s jurisprudence.  Indeed, “[i]f you’ve never heard of a statute being struck down on that ground,” and you recall having read countless cases approving of that arrangement, “you’re not alone.”  <em>Seila Law LLC</em> v. <em>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</em>, <a aria-label=\"591 U. S. 197\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/591/197\">591 U.&nbsp;S. 197</a>, 294 (2020) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Kagan, J., </span>concurring in judgment with respect to severability and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The majority pulls a rug out from under Congress without even acknowledging that its decision upends over two centuries of settled Government practice.  The United States, led by then-Solicitor General Robert Bork and then-Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division Rex Lee, told this Court in <em>Atlas Roofing</em> that “during the whole of our history, regulatory fines and penalties have been collected by non-jury procedures pursuant to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. legislative decisions,” and that “[i]t would be most remarkable if, at this late date, the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution seventh Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/seventh_amendment\">Seventh Amendment</a> were construed to outlaw this consistent rule of government followed for two centuries.”  Brief for Respondents in <em>Atlas Roofing</em>, O. T. 1976, No. 75–746, etc., pp. 81–82.  This Court agreed and upheld that practice, it seemed, once and for all.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; Following this Court’s precedents and the recommendation of the Administrative Conference of the United States, Congress has enacted countless new statutes in the past 50 years that have empowered federal agencies to impose civil penalties for statutory violations.  See 2 P. Verkuilm, D. Gifford, C. Koch, R. Pierce, &amp; J. Lubbers, Administrative Conference of the United States, Recommendations and Reports, The Federal Administrative Judiciary 861, and nn. 350–351 (1992). <em> </em>These statutes are sometimes enacted in addition to, but often instead of, “the traditional civil enforcement statutes that permitted agencies to collect civil penalties only after federal district court trials.”  <em>Id</em>., at 861.  “By 1986, there were over 200 such statutes” and “[t]he trend has, if anything, accelerated” since then.  <em>Id</em>., at 861, and n. 351.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Similarly, there are, at the very least, more than two dozen agencies that can impose civil penalties in administrative proceedings.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 78–79 (Principal Deputy Solicitor General) (recognizing two dozen agencies with administrative civil-penalty authorities); see also, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <a aria-label=\"5 USC 1215 a 3 A ii\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/1215#a_3_A_ii\">5 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §1215(a)(3)(A)(ii)</a> (Merit Systems Protection Board); <a aria-label=\"7 USC\" href=\"/uscode/text/7\">7</a> U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §§<a aria-label=\"7 USC 9 10 C\" href=\"/uscode/text/7/9#10_C\">9(10)(C)</a>, <a aria-label=\"7 USC 13a\" href=\"/uscode/text/7/13a\">13a</a> (Commodity Futures Trading Commission); §§499c(a), 586, 2279e(a) (Department of Agriculture); <a aria-label=\"8 USC\" href=\"/uscode/text/8\">8</a> U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §§<a aria-label=\"8 USC 1324c\" href=\"/uscode/text/8/1324c\">1324c</a>, <a aria-label=\"8 USC 1324d\" href=\"/uscode/text/8/1324d\">1324d</a> (Department of Justice); <a aria-label=\"12 USC 5563 a 2\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/5563#a_2\">12 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §§5563(a)(2)</a>, (c), (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau); <a aria-label=\"16 USC 823b c\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/823b#c\">16 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §823b(c)</a> (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission); <a aria-label=\"20 USC 1082 g\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1082#g\">20 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §1082(g)</a> (Department of Education); <a aria-label=\"21 USC 335b\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/335b\">21 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §335b</a> (Department of Health and Human Services/Food and Drug Administration); <a aria-label=\"29 USC 666 j\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/666#j\">29 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §666(j)</a> (Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission); <a aria-label=\"30 USC 820 a\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/30/820#a\">30 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §§820(a)</a> and (b) (Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission); <a aria-label=\"31 USC 5321 a 2\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5321#a_2\">31 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §5321(a)(2)</a> (Department of the Treasury); <a aria-label=\"33 USC 1319 d\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/33/1319#d\">33 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §§1319(d)</a> and (g) (Environmental Protection Agency); <a aria-label=\"39 USC 3018 c\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/39/3018#c\">39 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §3018(c)</a> (Postal Service); <a aria-label=\"42 USC 3545\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/3545\">42 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §3545</a>(f&nbsp;) (Department of Housing and Urban Development); <a aria-label=\"46 U.

See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <a aria-label=\"12 USC\" href=\"/uscode/text/12\">12</a> U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §§<a aria-label=\"12 USC 5563 a\" href=\"/uscode/text/12/5563#a\">5563(a)</a>, <a aria-label=\"12 USC 5564 a\" href=\"/uscode/text/12/5564#a\">5564(a)</a>, <a aria-label=\"12 USC 5565 a 1\" href=\"/uscode/text/12/5565#a_1\">5565(a)(1)</a>, (2)(H), and (c) (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau); <a aria-label=\"33 USC 1319 a\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/33/1319#a\">33 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §§1319(a)</a>, (b), and (g) (Environmental Protection Agency); <em>supra,</em> at 2 (SEC).  Others do not have that choice.  As the above-cited statutes confirm, the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission, the Department of Agriculture, and many others, can pursue civil penalties only in agency enforcement proceedings.  For those and countless other agencies, all the majority can say is tough luck; get a new statute from Congress.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Against this backdrop, our coequal branches will be surprised to learn that the rule they thought long settled, and which remained unchallenged for half a century, is one that, according to the majority and the concurrence, my dissent just announced today.  Unfortunately, that mistaken view means that the constitutionality of hundreds of statutes may now be in peril, and dozens of agencies could be stripped of their power to enforce laws enacted by Congress.  Rather than acknowledge the earthshattering nature of its holding, the majority has tried to disguise it.  The majority claims that its ruling is limited to “civil penalty suits for fraud” pursuant to a statute that is “barely over a decade old,” <em>ante,</em> at 18, n. 2, 22, an assurance that is in significant tension with other parts of its reasoning.  That incredible assertion should fool no one.  Today’s decision is a massive sea change.  Litigants seeking further dismantling of the “administrative state” have reason to rejoice in their win &nbsp;today, but those of us who cherish the rule of law have nothing to celebrate.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">*  *  *</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Today’s ruling is part of a disconcerting trend: When it comes to the separation of powers, this Court tells the American public and its coordinate branches that it knows best.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Collins</em> v. <em>Yellen</em>, <a aria-label=\"594 U. S. 220\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/594/220\">594 U.&nbsp;S. 220</a>, 227 (2021) (concluding that the Federal Housing Finance Agency’s “structure violates the separation of powers” because the Agency was led by a single Director removable by the President only “&nbsp;‘for cause’&nbsp;”);<em> United States</em> v. <em>Arthrex, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"594 U. S. 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/594/1\">594 U.&nbsp;S. 1</a>, 6, 23 (2021) (holding that “authority wielded by [Administrative Patent Judges] during inter partes review<em> </em>is incompatible with their appointment by the Secretary to an inferior office”); <em>Seila Law</em>, 591 U.&nbsp;S., at 202–205 (holding that “the structure of the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau] violates the separation of powers” because it was led by a single Director removable by the President only “for cause”); <em>Free Enterprise Fund</em> v. <em>Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd.</em>, <a aria-label=\"561 U. S. 477\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/561/477\">561 U.&nbsp;S. 477</a>, 483–484, 492 (2010) (holding “that the dual for-cause limitations on the removal of [Public Company Accounting Oversight] Board members contravene the Constitution’s separation of powers”).  The Court tells Congress how best to structure agencies, vindicate harms to the public at large, and even provide for the enforcement of rights created for<em> </em>the Government.  It does all of this despite the fact that, compared to its political counterparts, “the Judiciary possesses an inferior understanding of the realities of administration” and how “political power .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. operates.”  <em>Free Enterprise Fund</em>, 561 U.&nbsp;S., at 523 (Breyer, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> There are good reasons for Congress to set up a scheme like the SEC’s.  It may yield important benefits over jury trials in federal court, such as greater efficiency and expertise, transparency and reasoned decisionmaking, as well as &nbsp;uniformity, predictability, and greater political accountability.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., Brief for Administrative Law Scholars as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 30–32.  Others may believe those benefits are overstated, and that a federal jury is a better check on government overreach.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., Brief for Cato Institute as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 11–25. <em> </em>Those arguments take place against the backdrop of a philosophical (and perhaps ideological) debate on whether the number of agencies and authorities properly corresponds to the ever-increasing and evolving problems faced by our society.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This Court’s job is not to decide who wins this debate.  These are policy considerations for Congress in exercising its legislative judgment and constitutional authority to decide how to tackle today’s problems.  It is the electorate, and the Executive to some degree, not this Court, that can and should provide a check on the wisdom of those judgments.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Make no mistake: Today’s decision is a power grab.  Once again, “the majority arrogates Congress’s policymaking role to itself.”  <em>Garland</em> v. <em>Cargill</em>, <a aria-label=\"602 U. S. 406\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/602/406\">602 U.&nbsp;S. 406</a>, 442 (2024) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Sotomayor</span>, J., dissenting).  It prescribes artificial constraints on what modern-day adaptable governance must look like.  In telling Congress that it cannot entrust certain public-rights matters to the Executive because it must bring them first into the Judiciary’s province, the majority oversteps its role and encroaches on Congress’s constitutional authority.  Its decision offends the Framers’ constitutional design so critical to the preservation of individual liberty: the division of our Government into three coordinate branches to avoid the concentration of power in the same hands.  The Federalist No. 51, p. 349 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (J. Madison).  Judicial aggrandizement is as pernicious to the separation of powers as any aggrandizing action from either of the political branches.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Deeply entrenched in today’s ruling is the erroneous belief that any “mistaken or wrongful exertion by the legislative department of its authority” can lead to “grave abuses” &nbsp;and “it behooves the judiciary to apply a corrective by exceeding its own authority” through requiring civil-penalty claims to proceed before a federal jury.  <em>Stranahan</em>, 214 U.&nbsp;S., at 340.  As this Court said over a century ago in this public-rights context, that belief “mistakenly assumes that the courts can alone be safely intrusted with power, and that hence it is their duty to unlawfully exercise prerogatives which they have no right to exert, upon the assumption that wrong must be done to prevent wrong being accomplished.”  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> By giving respondents a jury trial, even one that the Constitution does not require, the majority may think that it is protecting liberty.  That belief, too, is deeply misguided.  The American People should not mistake judicial hubris with the protection of individual rights.  Our first President understood this well.  In his parting words to the Nation, he reminded us that a branch of Government arrogating for itself the power of another based on perceptions of what, “in one instance, may be the instrument of good .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is the customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed.”  Farewell Address (1796), in 35 The Writings of George Washington 229 (J. Fitzpatrick ed. 1940) (footnote omitted).  The majority today ignores that wisdom.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Because the Court disregards its own precedent and its coequal partners in our tripartite system of Government, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<h3 class=\"fnheader\">Notes</h3>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_6-1\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Sotomayor Dissent at reference 1\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-1ref\">1</a> &nbsp;As the majority notes, respondents also prevailed on two other constitutional challenges in the Court of Appeals.  See <em>ante,</em> at 6. <em> </em>The divided panel concluded that: (1) the SEC’s discretion to bring the case within the agency instead of federal court violated the nondelegation doctrine; and (2) a for-cause restriction on the Administrative Law Judge’s removal violated Article II and the separation of powers.  34 F. 4th 446, 459–465 (CA5 2022).

Bribes are typically payments made or agreed to <em>before</em> an official act in order to influence the public official with respect to that future official act.  Gratuities are typically payments made to a public official <em>after</em> an official act as a reward or token of appreciation.  While American law generally treats bribes as inherently corrupt and unlawful, the law’s treatment of gratuities is more nuanced.  Some gratuities might be innocuous, and others may raise ethical and appearance concerns.  Federal, state, and local governments have drawn different lines on which gratuities and gifts are acceptable and which are not.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-d jy-both\">  For example, Congress has established comprehensive prohibitions on both bribes and gratuities to federal officials.  If a federal official accepts a bribe for an official act, federal bribery law provides for a 15-year maximum prison sentence.  See <a aria-label=\"18 USC 201 b\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/201#b\">18 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §201(b)</a>.  By contrast, if a federal official accepts a prohibited gratuity, federal gratuities law sets a 2-year maximum prison sentence.  See §201(c).</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-d jy-both\">  In 1984, Congress passed and President Reagan signed a law now codified at <a aria-label=\"18 USC 666\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/666\">18 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §666</a> that, as relevant here, extended the gratuities prohibition in §201(c) to most state and local officials.  Congress reversed course after two years and amended §666 to avoid the law’s “possible application to acceptable commercial and business practices.”  H. R. Rep. No. 99–797, p. 30 (1986).  As amended, the text of §666 now closely resembles the bribery provision for federal officials, §201(b), and makes it a crime for most state and local officials to “corruptly” solicit, accept, or agree to accept “anything of value” “intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with” any official business or transaction worth $5,000 or more.  §§666(a)(1)(B), (b).  &nbsp;That crime carries a 10-year maximum prison sentence.  §666(a).</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-d jy-both\">  This case involves James Snyder, who is the former mayor of Portage, Indiana.  In 2013, while Snyder was mayor, Portage awarded two contracts to a local truck company, Great Lakes Peterbilt, and ultimately purchased five trash trucks from the company for about $1.1 million.  In 2014, Peterbilt cut a $13,000 check to Snyder.  The FBI and federal prosecutors suspected that the payment was a gratuity for the City’s trash truck contracts.  But Snyder said that the payment was for his consulting services as a contractor for Peterbilt.  A federal jury ultimately convicted Snyder of accepting an illegal gratuity in violation of §666(a)(1)(B).  The District Court sentenced Snyder to 1 year and 9 months in prison.  On appeal, Snyder argued that §666 criminalizes only bribes, not gratuities.  The Seventh Circuit affirmed Snyder’s conviction.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-e jy-both\"><em>Held</em>:&nbsp;Section 666 proscribes bribes to state and local officials but does not make it a crime for those officials to accept gratuities<em> </em>for their past acts.  Pp. 7–16.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">  (a)&nbsp;Six reasons, taken together, lead the Court to conclude that §666 is a bribery statute and not a gratuities statute—text, statutory history, statutory structure, statutory punishments, federalism, and fair notice.  Pp. 7–14.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">   (1)&nbsp;The statutory text strongly suggests that §666—like §201(b)—is a bribery statute, not a gratuities statute.  The dividing line between §201(b)’s bribery provision and §201(c)’s gratuities provision is that bribery requires an official to have a corrupt state of mind and to accept (or agree to accept) a payment intending to be influenced in an official act.  Section 666 shares the defining characteristics of §201(b)’s bribery provision.  By contrast, §666 bears little resemblance to §201(c), which contains no express <em>mens</em> <em>rea</em> requirement.  Pp. 7–8.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">   (2)&nbsp;The statutory history reinforces that result.  When enacted, §666 borrowed language from §201(c), the gratuities statute for federal officials.  Two years later, Congress amended §666 to model it instead on §201(b), the bribery statute.  It would be strange to interpret §666, as the Government suggests, to mean the same thing now that it did before the amendment.  Pp. 8–9.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">   (3)&nbsp;Statutory structure reinforces that §666 is a bribery statute, not a two-for-one bribery-and-gratuities statute as the Government posits.  The Government identifies no other provision in the U.&nbsp;S. Code that prohibits bribes and gratuities in the same provision.  And §201 does not do so.  That is because bribery and gratuities are “two separate crimes” with “two different sets of elements.”  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Sun-Diamond Growers of Cal.</em>, <a aria-label=\"526 U. S. 398\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/526/398\">526 U.&nbsp;S. 398</a>, 404.  P. 9.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">   (4)&nbsp;For federal officials, Congress has separated bribery and gratuities into two distinct provisions of §201 for good reason:  The &nbsp;crimes receive different punishments that “reflect their relative seriousness.”  <em>Sun-Diamond</em>, 526 U. S., at 405.  For example, accepting a bribe as a federal official is punishable by up to 15 years in prison, while accepting an illegal gratuity as a federal official is punishable by up to only 2 years. If the Government were correct that §666 also covered gratuities, Congress would have inexplicably authorized punishing gratuities to state and local officials five times more severely than gratuities to federal officials—10 years for state and local officials compared to 2 years for federal officials.  The Government cannot explain why Congress would have created such substantial sentencing disparities.  Pp. 9–10.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">   (5)&nbsp;Interpreting §666 as a gratuities statute would significantly infringe on bedrock federalism principles.  Generally, States have the “prerogative to regulate the permissible scope of interactions between state officials and their constituents.”  <em>McDonnell</em> v. <em>United</em> <em>States</em>, <a aria-label=\"579 U. S. 550\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/579/550\">579 U.&nbsp;S. 550</a>, 576.  The differing approaches by the state and local governments reflect policy judgments about when gifts expressing appreciation to public officials for their past acts cross the line from the innocuous to the problematic.  Those carefully calibrated policy decisions would be gutted if the Court were to accept the Government’s interpretation of §666.  Reading §666 to create a federal prohibition on gratuities would suddenly subject 19 million state and local officials to a new and different regulatory regime for gratuities.  The Court should hesitate before concluding that Congress prohibited gratuities that state and local governments have allowed.  After all, Congress does not lightly override state and local governments on such core matters of state and local governance.  Pp. 10–11.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">   (6)&nbsp;The Government’s interpretation of the statute would create traps for unwary state and local officials.  <em>Sun-Diamond</em>, 526 U.&nbsp;S., at 411.  The Government says that the statute would not cover “innocuous” or “obviously benign” gratuities, but the Government does not identify any remotely clear lines separating such a gratuity from a criminal gratuity.  The Government simply opines that state and local officials may not accept wrongful gratuities.  The Government’s so-called guidance would leave state and local officials entirely at sea to guess about what gifts they are allowed to accept under federal law, with the threat of up to 10 years in federal prison if they happen to guess wrong.  That is not how federal criminal law works.  And the Court has rejected the view that it should construe a criminal statute on the assumption that the Government will use it responsibly.  See <em>McDonnell</em>, 579 U.&nbsp;S., at 576.  Pp. 11–14.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">  (b)&nbsp;Faced with the phalanx of difficulties with its interpretation of §666, the Government’s argument boils down to one main point—that §666 uses the term “rewarded” as well as “influenced.”  The &nbsp;Government says that Congress would not have added the term “rewarded” to “influenced” in §666 if the statute were meant to cover only bribes and not also gratuities.  That argument is misconceived.  Contrary to the premise of the Government’s argument, bribery statutes sometimes use the term “reward.”  See,<em> e.g.</em>, <a aria-label=\"18 USC 600\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/600\">18 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §600</a>; <a aria-label=\"33 USC 447\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/33/447\">33 U. S. C. §447</a>.  Moreover, without the term “rewarded” in §666, an official might try to defend against a bribery charge by saying that the payment was received only after the official act and therefore could not have “influenced” the act.  By including the term “rewarded,” Congress made clear that the timing of the agreement is the key, not the timing of payment.  Although a gratuity or reward offered and accepted by a state or local official after the official act may be unethical or illegal under other federal, state, or local laws, the gratuity does not violate §666.

That law prohibits state and local officials from accepting <em>bribes </em>that are promised or given before the official act.  Those bribes are punishable by up to 10 years’ imprisonment.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The question in this case is whether §666 also makes it a crime for state and local officials to accept <em>gratuities</em>—for example, gift cards, lunches, plaques, books, framed photos, or the like—that may be given as a token of appreciation after<em> </em>the official act.  The answer is no.  State and local governments often regulate the gifts that state and local officials may accept.  Section 666 does not supplement those state and local rules by subjecting 19 million state and local officials to up to 10 years in federal prison for accepting even commonplace gratuities.  Rather, §666 leaves it to state and local governments to regulate gratuities to state and local officials.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">&nbsp;I</h3>\n<h4 class=\"jy-center\">A</h4>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Federal and state law distinguish between two kinds of payments to public officials—bribes and gratuities.  As a general matter, bribes are payments made or agreed to <em>before</em> an official act in order to influence the official with respect to that future official act.  American law generally treats bribes as inherently corrupt and unlawful.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> But the law’s treatment of gratuities is more nuanced.  Gratuities are typically payments made to an official <em>after</em> an official act as a token of appreciation.  Some gratuities can be problematic.  Others are commonplace and might be innocuous.  A family gives a holiday tip to the mail carrier.  Parents send an end-of-year gift basket to their child’s public school teacher.  A college dean gives a college sweatshirt to a city council member who comes to speak at an event.  A state legislator’s neighbor drops off a bottle of wine to congratulate her for her work on a new law. </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> As those examples suggest, gratuities after the official act are not the same as bribes before the official act.  After all, unlike gratuities, bribes can corrupt the official act—meaning that the official takes the act for private gain, not for the public good.  That said, gratuities can sometimes also raise ethical and appearance concerns.  For that reason, Congress, States, and local governments have long regulated gratuities to public officials.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Not surprisingly, different governments draw lines in different places.  For example, some States allow public officials to accept gifts below certain threshold amounts.  <em>E</em>.<em>g</em>., Colo. Const., Art. XXIX, §3(6) (allowing gifts under $75); Kan. Stat. Ann. §46–237(a)(1) (2021) (allowing gifts under $40 per year); Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 268A, §§3(b), (f), 23(b), (f) (2020) (allowing gifts under $50); W. Va. Code Ann. §61–5A–6(b) (Lexis 2020) (allowing “trivial” gifts that pose “no substantial risk of affecting official impartiality”).  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Some States bar accepting any gifts for specific activities, &nbsp;like certain speaking engagements.  <em>E</em>.<em>g</em>., Ark. Code Ann. §5–52–108 (2016).  Some States make accepting gifts for official conduct a misdemeanor.  <em>E</em>.<em>g</em>., Del. Code Ann., Tit. 11, §1206 (Cum. Supp. 2022); W. Va. Code Ann. §61–5A–9(d).  Other States make it a felony.  <em>E</em>.<em>g</em>., Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§38–505(A), 38–510(A)(1) (2019). </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Many States make exceptions for certain gifts, such as gifts from friends or family, travel reimbursements, campaign contributions, and ceremonial gifts like honorary degrees and plaques.  <em>E</em>.<em>g</em>., Colo. Const., Art. XXIX, §3(3); Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 268A, §§3(f), 23(f); N.&nbsp;Y. Legis. Law Ann. §1–c(j) (West Cum. Supp. 2024); W. Va. Code Ann. §61–5A–6(b).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Like the States, the counties, cities, and towns of America take various approaches to regulating gratuities to their officials.  Just within the State of Indiana, where the current case arose, some local governments set a gift limit of $50, or $100, or $200, or $300.  <em>E</em>.<em>g</em>., Butler, Ind., Code of Ordinances §30.27(G) (2019); Gary, Ind., Municipal Code §2–472(b)(1) (2021); Valparaiso, Ind., Code of Ordinances §36.05(B)(6) (2024); Noblesville, Ind., Code of Ordinances §36.05(B)(2) (2024).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Some prohibit gifts only from business entities currently doing business with the local government.  <em>E</em>.<em>g</em>., Carmel, Ind., Code of Ordinances §2–184(f)(3) (2024).  Others restrict gifts from businesses bidding for government contracts.  <em>E</em>.<em>g</em>., Johnson County, Ind., Code of Ordinances §4–6–1–1 (2024).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> With respect to gratuities to state and local officials, many of those officials are part-time and are allowed to hold outside employment.  That reality can create complications for regulating gifts to those officials, and the rules often reflect that reality.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Meanwhile, Congress has established federal standards for federal officials.  In 1962, Congress passed and President Kennedy signed into law <a aria-label=\"18 USC 201\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/201\">18 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §201</a>, which &nbsp;contains comprehensive prohibitions on bribes and gratuities to federal officials.  See <a href=\"/rio/citation/76_Stat._1119\">76 Stat. 1119</a>.  As to gratuities, that statute imposes criminal penalties on federal officials who seek or accept “anything of value” for “any official act.”  <a aria-label=\"18 USC 201 c 1 B\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/201#c_1_B\">18 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §201(c)(1)(B)</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The U.&nbsp;S. Office of Government Ethics, or OGE, has implemented §201 and promulgated numerous gratuities rules and exceptions.  See <a aria-label=\"5 CFR\" href=\"/cfr/text/5\">5</a> CFR §2635.202(c) (2023).  For example, OGE has stated that federal officials may accept gifts that are “motivated by a family relationship or personal friendship,” not by the “position of the employee.”  §2635.204(b).  And OGE has also carved out exceptions for officials to accept gifts of $20 or less per occasion, awards and honorary degrees, refreshments at social events, and the like.  See §2635.204.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Importantly, because bribery can corrupt the official act, Congress treats bribery as a far more serious offense than gratuities.  For example, if a federal official accepts a bribe, federal bribery law provides for a 15-year maximum prison sentence.  See <a aria-label=\"18 USC 201 b\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/201#b\">18 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §201(b)</a>.  By contrast, if a federal official accepts a prohibited gratuity, federal gratuities law sets a 2-year maximum prison sentence.  See §201(c).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In the 1970s and early 1980s, confusion emerged in the Courts of Appeals over whether the federal bribery and gratuities laws in §201(b) and §201(c) applied not only to federal officials but also to state and local officials.  See <em>Salinas</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"522 U. S. 52\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/522/52\">522 U.&nbsp;S. 52</a>, 58 (1997).  In response, Congress passed and President Reagan signed a law now codified at <a aria-label=\"18 USC 666\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/666\">18 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §666</a>.  See <a href=\"/rio/citation/98_Stat._2143\">98 Stat. 2143</a>.  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> As relevant here, §666 originally extended the gratuities prohibition in §201(c) to most state and local officials.  See <em>Salinas</em>, 522 U.&nbsp;S., at 58;<em> </em><a aria-label=\"18 USC 666 b\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/666#b\">18 U. S. C. §666(b)</a> (1982 ed., Supp. II).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> But after only two years, Congress reversed course.  In &nbsp;1986, Congress amended §666 and thereby avoided the law’s “possible application to acceptable commercial and business practices.”  H. R. Rep. No. 99–797, p. 30 (1986); see <a href=\"/rio/citation/100_Stat._3612\">100 Stat. 3612</a>–3613.  As a result of its amendment in 1986, the text of §666 for state and local officials now closely resembles the bribery provision for federal officials, §201(b), rather than the gratuities provision for federal officials, §201(c).  As relevant here, §666 makes it a crime for most state and local officials to “corruptly” solicit, accept, or agree to accept “anything of value” “intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with” any official business or transaction worth $5,000 or more.  §§666(a)(1)(B), (b).  That crime carries a 10-year maximum prison sentence.  §666(a).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">C</h3>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This case involves the former mayor of Portage, Indiana.  Portage is a city in northwest Indiana with a population of about 38,000.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Like other States, Indiana criminalizes bribery committed by state and local officials.  See Ind. Code §35–44.1–1–2(a)(2) (2023).  Indiana also prescribes civil penalties such as fines, reprimands, and disqualification from state employment if state officials accept gratuities in violation of the State’s Code of Ethics.  See Ind. Code §4–2–6–12 (2021); 42 Ind. Admin. Code §1–5–1 (2024).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> But Indiana does not impose general criminal or civil prohibitions on local officials who accept gratuities, leaving such regulation to the local governments themselves.  As relevant here, the City of Portage sets limits on the gifts that local officials can accept from contractors doing business with the City.  See Portage, Ind., Municipal Code of Ordinances §§2–178(e)–(f) (2024).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In 2013, the City of Portage awarded two contracts to a local truck company, Great Lakes Peterbilt, to purchase trash trucks.  In total, the City paid about $1.1 million for &nbsp;five trucks.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In 2014, Peterbilt cut a $13,000 check to James Snyder, who was the mayor of Portage (and had been at the time of the contracts).  The FBI and federal prosecutors suspected that the payment was a gratuity for the City’s trash truck contracts.  But Snyder said that he had also agreed to be a contractor for Peterbilt, providing consulting services.  (Like many jurisdictions around the country, neither Indiana nor Portage apparently prohibited local officials from obtaining outside employment.)  Snyder said that the payment was for his consulting services.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Snyder has never been charged by state prosecutors for bribery.  And he has never been charged or disciplined by Portage for violating the City’s gift rules.  The Federal Government charged and a federal jury convicted Snyder of accepting an illegal gratuity (the $13,000 check from Peterbilt) in violation of <a aria-label=\"18 USC 666 a 1 B\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/666#a_1_B\">18 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §666(a)(1)(B)</a>.  The Government asked for about a 4- to 5-year prison sentence.  The District Court sentenced Snyder to 1 year and 9 months in prison.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 47a.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> On appeal, Snyder argued that §666 criminalizes only bribes, not gratuities.  The U.&nbsp;S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit disagreed based on that court’s precedent interpreting §666 to cover both bribes and gratuities.  71 F.&nbsp;4th 555, 578–580 (2023).  So the Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In light of a split in the Courts of Appeals over whether §666 criminalizes gratuities as well as bribes, this Court granted certiorari.  601 U.&nbsp;S. ___ (2023).  Compare <em>United States</em> v. <em>Hamilton</em>, 46 F.&nbsp;4th 389, 397 (CA5 2022); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fernandez</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/722_F.3d_1\">722 F.&nbsp;3d 1</a>, 26 (CA1 2013), with <em>United States</em> v. <em>Abbey</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/560_F.3d_513\">560 F.&nbsp;3d 513</a>, 520 (CA6 2009); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Zimmermann</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/509_F.3d_920\">509 F.&nbsp;3d 920</a>, 927 (CA8 2007); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Agostino</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/132_F.3d_1183\">132 F.&nbsp;3d 1183</a>, 1190 (CA7 1997); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bonito</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/57_F.3d_167\">57 F.&nbsp;3d 167</a>, 171 (CA2 1995).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">&nbsp;II</h3>\n<h4 class=\"jy-center\">A</h4>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The question in this case is whether <a aria-label=\"18 USC 666 a 1 B\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/666#a_1_B\">18 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §666(a)(1)(B)</a> makes it a federal crime for state and local officials to accept gratuities for their past official acts.  The answer is no.  Six reasons, taken together, lead us to conclude that §666 is a bribery statute and not a gratuities statute—text, statutory history, statutory structure, statutory punishments, federalism, and fair notice.  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>First</em> is the text of §666.  Section 666(a)(1)(B) makes it a crime for state and local officials to “corruptly” accept a payment “intending to be influenced or rewarded” for an official act.<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Kavanaugh Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-1\" id=\"OPINION_4-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a>  Congress modeled the text of §666(a)(1)(B) for state and local officials on §201(b), the bribery provision for federal officials.  Section 201(b) similarly makes it a crime for federal officials to “corruptly” accept a payment “in return for” “being influenced” in an official act.<a aria-label=\"reference 2 of Kavanaugh Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-2\" id=\"OPINION_4-2ref\"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a>  By contrast, §666 bears little resemblance to §201(c), the &nbsp;gratuities provision for federal officials, which contains no express <em>mens rea</em> requirements and simply makes it a crime for federal officials to accept a payment “for or because of any official act.”<a aria-label=\"reference 3 of Kavanaugh Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-3\" id=\"OPINION_4-3ref\"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></a> </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Therefore, the dividing line between §201(b)’s bribery provision and §201(c)’s gratuities provision is that bribery requires that the official have a corrupt state of mind and accept (or agree to accept) the payment intending to be influenced in the official act.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Sun-Diamond Growers of Cal.</em>, <a aria-label=\"526 U. S. 398\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/526/398\">526 U.&nbsp;S. 398</a>, 404–405 (1999).  Section 666 shares the defining characteristics of §201(b)’s bribery provision: the corrupt state of mind and the intent to be influenced in the official act.  The statutory text therefore strongly suggests that §666—like §201(b)—is a bribery statute, not a gratuities statute.  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Second</em> is the statutory history, which reinforces that textual analysis. <em> </em>In 1984, when first enacting §666 for state and local officials, Congress borrowed language from the gratuities statute for federal officials, §201(c).  See <a aria-label=\"18 USC 666 b\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/666#b\">18 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §666(b)</a> (1982 ed., Supp. II).  But just two years later, in 1986, Congress overhauled §666, eliminated the gratuities language, and instead enacted the current language that resembles the bribery provision for federal officials, §201(b).  Perhaps Congress in 1986 concluded that federally criminalizing state and local gratuities would significantly intrude on federalism.  Whatever the impetus, we know that Congress decided in 1986 to change the law and to model §666 on §201(b), the bribery statute, and not &nbsp;on §201(c), the gratuities statute.  It therefore would be strange to interpret §666, as the Government suggests, to mean the same thing now that it meant back in 1984, before the 1986 amendment.  We must respect Congress’s choice in 1986.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Third </em>is the statutory structure.  The Government posits that Congress prohibited bribes and gratuities to state and local officials in a single statutory provision, §666(a)(1)(B).  Such a statute would be highly unusual, if not unique.  The Government identifies no other provision in the U.&nbsp;S. Code that prohibits bribes and gratuities in the same provision.<a aria-label=\"reference 4 of Kavanaugh Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-4\" id=\"OPINION_4-4ref\"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup></a>  That is because bribery and gratuities are “two separate crimes” with “two different sets of elements.”  <em>Sun-Diamond</em>, 526 U.&nbsp;S., at 404.  Therefore, §201(b) makes it a crime for federal officials to accept bribes, while a separate provision, §201(c), makes it a crime for federal officials to accept certain gratuities.  The absence of a separate gratuities provision in §666 reinforces that §666 is a bribery statute for state and local officials, not a two-for-one bribery-and-gratuities statute. </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Fourth</em> are the statutory punishments.  For federal officials, Congress has separated bribery and gratuities into two distinct provisions of §201 for good reason:  The crimes receive different punishments that “reflect their relative seriousness.”  <em>Sun-Diamond</em>, 526 U.&nbsp;S., at 405.  For example, accepting a bribe as a federal official is punishable by up to 15 years in prison, while accepting an illegal gratuity as a federal official is punishable by only up to 2 years.  Compare §201(b) with §201(c).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; If the Government were correct that §666 also covered gratuities, Congress would have created an entirely inexplicable regime for state and local officials.  For one, even though bribery has been treated as a far more serious offense, Congress would have authorized the same 10-year maximum sentences for (i)&nbsp;gratuities to state and local officials and (ii)&nbsp;bribes to state and local officials.  See <em>Sun-Diamond</em>, 526 U. S., at 405.  In addition, Congress would have authorized punishing gratuities to state<em> </em>and<em> </em>local officials five times more severely than gratuities to federal officials—10 years for state and local officials compared to 2 years for federal officials.  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Government cannot explain why Congress would have created such substantial sentencing disparities.  We cannot readily assume that Congress authorized a 2-year sentence for, say, a Cabinet Secretary who accepts an unlawful gratuity while authorizing a 10-year sentence on a local school board member who accepts an identical gratuity.  What sense would that make?  In short, the inexplicable anomalies ushered in by the Government’s approach powerfully demonstrate that §666 is a bribery statute.  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Fifth </em>is federalism.  Interpreting §666 as a gratuities statute would significantly infringe on bedrock federalism principles.  As this Court has long recognized, a State “defines itself as a sovereign through the structure of its government, and the character of those who exercise government authority.”  <em>McDonnell</em> v. <em>United</em> <em>States</em>, <a aria-label=\"579 U. S. 550\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/579/550\">579 U.&nbsp;S. 550</a>, 576 (2016) (quotation marks omitted).  Therefore, as a general matter, States have the “prerogative to regulate the permissible scope of interactions between state officials and their constituents.”  <em>Ibid</em>.; see <em>United States</em> v. <em>Bass</em>, <a aria-label=\"404 U. S. 336\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/404/336\">404 U.&nbsp;S. 336</a>, 350 (1971).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> As noted above, state and local governments have adopted a variety of approaches to regulating state and local officials’ acceptance of gratuities.  See <em>supra</em>, at 2–4.  &nbsp;Those differing approaches reflect nuanced state and local policy judgments about when gifts expressing appreciation to public officials for their past acts cross the line from the innocuous to the problematic.  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The carefully calibrated policy decisions that the States and local governments have made about gratuities would be gutted if we were to accept the Government’s interpretation of §666.  After all, §666 covers virtually all state and local officials—about 19 million nationwide.  So reading §666 to create a federal prohibition on gratuities would suddenly subject 19 million state and local officials to a new and different regulatory regime for gratuities.  In other words, a county official could meticulously comply with her county’s local gratuities rules—say, by declining a $200 gift card but accepting a $100 gift card from a neighbor as thanks for her diligent work on a new park—but still face up to 10 years in federal prison because she accepted a thing of value in connection with an official act.  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> We should hesitate before concluding that Congress prohibited gratuities that state and local governments have allowed for their officials.  After all, Congress does not lightly override state and local governments on such core matters of state and local governance.  And the principle articulated by this Court in <em>Sun-Diamond</em> fits this case as well:  A “narrow, rather than a sweeping, prohibition is more compatible with the fact that” this statute “is merely one strand of an intricate web of regulations, both administrative and criminal, governing the acceptance of gifts and other self-enriching actions by public officials.”  526 U.&nbsp;S., at 409.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In short, federalism principles weigh heavily in favor of reading §666 as a bribery statute and not as a gratuities law.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Sixth</em> is fair notice.<em> </em>The Government’s interpretation of the statute would create traps for unwary state and local officials.  <em>Sun-Diamond</em>, 526 U.&nbsp;S., at 411.  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; The Government had to choose between two options for how to read §666.  The Government could read §666 to ban all gratuities, no matter how trivial, in connection with covered official acts.  That option might be clear enough.  But that draconian approach would border on the absurd and exacerbate the already serious federalism problems with the Government’s reading of §666.  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Alternatively, the Government could recognize the irrationality of reading §666 to criminalize all such gratuities.  And to deal with the overbreadth problems, the Government could make atextual exceptions on the fly.  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Government opted for the second approach, seeking to soothe concerns about overbreadth by saying that the statute, even under its view, would not cover “innocuous” or “obviously benign” gratuities.  Brief for United States 39; Tr. of Oral Arg. 41, 45–49.  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> But that effort to address those overbreadth concerns has simply moved the Government from one sinkhole to another.  The flaw in the Government’s approach—and it is a very serious real-world problem—is that the Government does not identify any remotely clear lines separating an innocuous or obviously benign gratuity from a criminal gratuity.  The Government simply opines that state and local officials may not accept “wrongful” gratuities.  Brief for United States 39; Tr. of Oral Arg. 46.  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> That is no guidance at all.  Is a $100 Dunkin’ Donuts gift card for a trash collector wrongful?  What about a $200 Nike gift card for a county commissioner who voted to fund new school athletic facilities?  Could students take their college professor out to Chipotle for an end-of-term celebration?  And if so, would it somehow become criminal to take the professor for a steak dinner?  Or to treat her to a Hoosiers game?  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Government offers no clear federal rules for state and local officials.  So how are state legislators, city council members, school board officials, building code inspectors, &nbsp;probation officers, human resource directors, police officers, librarians, snow plow drivers, court clerks, prison guards, high school basketball coaches, mayors, zoning board members, animal control officers, social workers, firefighters, city planners, and the entire army of 19 million state and local officials to know what is acceptable and what is criminalized by the Federal Government?  They cannot.  The Government’s so-called guidance would leave state and local officials entirely at sea to guess about what gifts they are allowed to accept under federal law, with the threat of up to 10 years in federal prison if they happen to guess wrong.  That is not how federal criminal law works.<a aria-label=\"reference 5 of Kavanaugh Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-5\" id=\"OPINION_4-5ref\"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Responding to the legitimate concern that the federal lines are unknown and unknowable to state and local officials, the Government advances the familiar plea that federal prosecutors can be trusted not to enforce this statute against small-time violators.  But as this Court has said time and again, the Court “cannot construe a criminal statute on the assumption that the Government will use it responsibly.”  <em>McDonnell</em>, 579 U.&nbsp;S., at 576 (quotation marks omitted); see <em>Percoco</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"598 U.S. 319\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/598/319\">598 U.&nbsp;S. 319 (2023)</a>; <em>Ciminelli</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"598 U.S. 306\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/598/306\">598 U.&nbsp;S. 306 (2023)</a>; <em>Kelly</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"590 U.S. 391\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/590/391\">590 U.&nbsp;S. 391 (2020)</a>; <em>Skilling</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"561 U.S. 358\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/561/358\">561 U.&nbsp;S. 358 (2010)</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The lack of fair notice for state and local officials is highlighted by comparing the non-existent federal gratuities guidance given to state and local officials with &nbsp;the extensive federal gratuities guidance given to federal workers.  The Office of Government Ethics has promulgated comprehensive and detailed regulatory guidelines specifying what gifts are allowed and prohibited for federal workers.  For instance, the guidelines for federal officials set forth cost thresholds, exempt certain gifts from friends or family, clarify what discounts are acceptable, and explain which social invitations an official may accept—all with multiple examples to guide federal officials’ conduct.  See <a aria-label=\"5 CFR\" href=\"/cfr/text/5\">5</a> CFR §2635.204.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Nothing for state and local officials.  It is unfathomable that Congress would authorize a 10-year criminal sentence for gifts to 19 million state and local officials without any coherent federal guidance (or any federal guidance at all) about how an official can distinguish the innocuous from the criminal.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> When construing a statute like this that regulates state and local officials, this Court’s precedents caution against leaving the statute’s “outer boundaries ambiguous” and involving the “Federal Government in setting standards of good government for local and state officials.”  <em>McDonnell</em>, 579 U.&nbsp;S., at 577 (quotation marks omitted).  And the Court has emphasized that a “statute in this field that can linguistically be interpreted to be either a meat axe or a scalpel should reasonably be taken to be the latter.”  <em>Sun-Diamond</em>,<em> </em>526 U.&nbsp;S., at 412.  So it is here.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Faced with that phalanx of difficulties with its interpretation of §666, the Government offers little.  The Government’s argument boils down to one main point—that §666 uses the term “rewarded” as well as “influenced.”  And that, too, is the dissent’s main point.  The Government (echoed by the dissent) says that Congress would not have added the term “rewarded” to “influenced” in §666 if the statute were meant to cover only bribes and not also &nbsp;gratuities.  That argument is misconceived.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In isolation, the word “rewarded” could be part of a gratuities statute or a bribery statute—either (i)&nbsp;a reward given after the act with no agreement beforehand (gratuity) or (ii) a reward given after the act pursuant to an agreement beforehand (bribe).  But as noted above, the word “corruptly” in the text of §666 helps resolve the issue here.  The bribery statute for federal officials, §201(b), uses the term “corruptly.”  But the gratuities statute for federal officials, §201(c), does not.  The term “corruptly” therefore signals that §666 is a bribery statute.  And statutory history, statutory structure, statutory punishments, federalism, and fair notice strongly reinforce that textual signal and together establish that §666 is a bribery statute.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Contrary to the premise of the Government’s argument, moreover, bribery statutes sometimes use the term “reward.”  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <a aria-label=\"18 USC 600\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/600\">18 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §600</a>; <a aria-label=\"33 USC 447\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/33/447\">33 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §447</a>.  The term “rewarded” closes off certain defenses that otherwise might be raised in bribery cases.  Consider a bribe where the agreement was made before the act but the payment was made after the act.  An official might try to defend against the bribery charge by saying that the payment was received only after the official act and therefore could not have “influenced” the act.  By including the term “rewarded,” Congress made clear that the timing of the agreement is the key, not the timing of the payment, and thereby precluded such a potential defense.  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> And<em> </em>think about the official who took a bribe before the official act but asserts as a defense that he would have taken the same act anyway and therefore was not “influenced” by the payment.  To shut the door on that potential defense to a §666 bribery charge, Congress sensibly added the term “rewarded.” </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> So even if “influenced” alone might have covered the waterfront of bribes, adding “rewarded” made good sense to avoid potential ambiguities, gaps, or loopholes.  Congress &nbsp;commonly writes federal statutes, including bribery statutes, in such a belt and suspenders manner.  Here, the term “rewarded” does not transform §666 into a gratuities statute.</p>\n<p class=\"normal jy-both\"> In sum, §666 tracks §201(b), the bribery provision for federal officials.  A state or local official can violate §666 when he accepts an up-front payment for a future official act or agrees to a future reward for a future official act.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Fernandez</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/722_F.3d_1\">722 F.&nbsp;3d 1</a>, 23 (CA1 2013) (the word “reward” “clarifies that a bribe can be promised before, but paid after, the official’s action” (quotation marks omitted)).  But a state or local official does not violate §666 if the official has taken the official act before any reward is agreed to, much less given.  Although a gratuity offered and accepted after the official act may be unethical or illegal under other federal, state, or local laws, the gratuity does not violate §666.  </p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">*  *  *</h3>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Government asks this Court to adopt an interpretation of §666 that would radically upend gratuities rules and turn §666 into a vague and unfair trap for 19 million state and local officials.  We decline to do so.  Section 666 is a vital statute, but its focus is targeted:  Section 666 proscribes bribes to state and local officials, while allowing state and local governments to regulate gratuities to state and local officials.  Within constitutional bounds, Congress can always change the law if it wishes to do so.  But since 1986, it has not, presumably because Congress understands that state and local governments may and often do regulate gratuities to state and local officials.  We reverse the judgment of the U.&nbsp;S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p class=\"flushrgtpara jy-right\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<h3 class=\"fnheader\">Notes</h3>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-1\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Kavanaugh Opinion at reference 1\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-1ref\">1</a> &nbsp;Section 666(a)(1)(B) provides:“Whoever .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. being an agent of an organization, or of a State, local, or Indian tribal government, or any agency thereof [that receives more than $10,000 in federal funds annually] corruptly solicits or demands for the benefit of any person, or accepts or agrees to accept, anything of value from any person, intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with any business, transaction, or series of transactions of such organization, government, or agency involving any thing of value of $5,000 or more; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.”</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-2\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Kavanaugh Opinion at reference 2\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-2ref\">2</a> &nbsp;Section 201(b)(2)(A) provides:“Whoever .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. being a public official or person selected to be a public official, directly or indirectly, corruptly demands, seeks, receives, accepts, or agrees to receive or accept anything of value personally or for any other person or entity, in return for: being influenced in the performance of any official act; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall be fined under this title or not more than three times the monetary equivalent of the thing of value, whichever is greater, or imprisoned for not more than fifteen years, or both, and may be disqualified from holding any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.” </p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-3\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Kavanaugh Opinion at reference 3\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-3ref\">3</a> &nbsp;Section 201(c)(1)(B) provides:“Whoever otherwise than as provided by law for the proper discharge of official duty .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. being a public official, former public official, or person selected to be a public official, otherwise than as provided by law for the proper discharge of official duty, directly or indirectly demands, seeks, receives, accepts, or agrees to receive or accept anything of value personally for or because of any official act performed or to be performed by such official or person .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than two years, or both.”</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-4\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Kavanaugh Opinion at reference 4\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-4ref\">4</a> &nbsp;At most, the Government points to <a aria-label=\"18 USC 215 a 2\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/215#a_2\">18 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §215(a)(2)</a>, which bars employees of financial institutions from “corruptly” soliciting or accepting “anything of value .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with any business or transaction of such institution.”  That language simply mirrors §666’s language.  But because this Court has never interpreted §215 (and therefore has never said whether §215 covers only bribery), that statute is a null data point.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-5\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Kavanaugh Opinion at reference 5\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-5ref\">5</a> &nbsp;The Government’s interpretation seems all the more unbelievable because §666 applies to the gift-givers as well as the state and local officials accepting the gifts.  Specifically, §666(a)(2) makes it a crime punishable by 10 years’ imprisonment for someone to “corruptly” offer or give “anything of value” to state and local officials “with intent to influence or reward.”  So under the Government’s approach, families, students, constituents, and other members of the public would be forced to guess whether they could even offer (much less actually give) thank-you gift cards, steak dinners, or Fever tickets to their garbage collectors, professors, or school board members, for example.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"concurrence\">&nbsp;<hr><a aria-label=\"Top\" href=\"#writing-ZS\" id=\"writing-23-108_CONCUR_5\"><strong>TOP</strong></a>\n<h2>Concurrence</h2>\n<div class=\"bodytext\">\n<p class=\"scusnameplate jy-center\">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p class=\"rule jy-center\">_________________</p>\n<p class=\"casenumber jy-center\">No. 23–108</p>\n<p class=\"rule jy-center\">_________________</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-a jy-center\">JAMES E.

It discusses concerns of fair notice and federalism.  <em>Ibid.</em>  But the bottom line is that, for all those reasons, any fair reader of this statute would be left with a reasonable doubt about whether it covers the defendant’s charged conduct.  And when that happens, judges are bound by the ancient rule of lenity to decide the case as the Court does today, not for the prosecutor but for the presumptively free individual.

Greed makes governments—at every level—less responsive, less efficient, and less trustworthy from the perspective of the communities they serve.  Perhaps realizing this, Congress used “expansive, unqualified language” in <a aria-label=\"18 USC 666\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/666\">18 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §666</a> to criminalize graft involving state, local, and tribal entities, as well as other organizations receiving federal funds.  <em>Salinas</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"522 U. S. 52\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/522/52\">522 U.&nbsp;S. 52</a>, 56 (1997).  Section 666 imposes federal criminal penalties on agents of those entities who “corruptly” solicit, accept, or agree to accept payments “intending to be influenced or rewarded.”  §666(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Today’s case involves one such person.  James Snyder, a former Indiana mayor, was convicted by a jury of violating §666 after he steered more than $1 million in city contracts to a local truck dealership, which turned around and cut him a $13,000 check.  He asks us to decide whether the language of §666 criminalizes both bribes and gratuities, or just bribes.  And he says the answer matters because bribes require an upfront <em>agreement</em> to take official actions for payment, and he never agreed beforehand to be paid the $13,000 from the dealership.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Snyder’s absurd and atextual reading of the statute is one &nbsp;only today’s Court could love.  Ignoring the plain text of §666—which, again,  expressly targets officials who “corruptly” solicit, accept, or agree to accept payments “intending to be influenced <em>or</em> <em>rewarded</em>”—the Court concludes that the statute does not criminalize gratuities at all.  This is so, apparently, because “[s]tate and local governments often regulate the gifts that state and local officials may accept,” <em>ante,</em> at 1, which, according to the majority, means that §666 cannot.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Court’s reasoning elevates nonexistent federalism concerns over the plain text of this statute and is a quintessential example of the tail wagging the dog.  Section 666’s regulation of state, local, and tribal governments reflects Congress’s express choice to reach those and other entities receiving federal funds.  And Congress not only had good reasons for doing so, it also had the authority to take such legislative action, as this Court has already recognized.  See <em>Sabri</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"541 U. S. 600\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/541/600\">541 U.&nbsp;S. 600</a>, 605, 608 (2004). We have long held that when Congress has appropriated federal money, it “does not have to sit by and accept the risk of operations thwarted by local and state improbity.”  <em>Id</em>., at 605<em>.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Both the majority and Snyder suggest that interpreting §666 to cover gratuities is problematic because it gives “federal prosecutors unwarranted power to allege crimes that <em>should</em> be handled at the State level.”  App. 14–15 (emphasis added); see also <em>ante,</em> at 10–11.  But woulds, coulds, and shoulds of this nature must be addressed across the street with Congress, not in the pages of the U.&nbsp;S. Reports.  We have previously and wisely declined “to express [a] view as to [§666’s] soundness as a policy matter.”  <em>Sabri</em>, 541 U.&nbsp;S., at 608, n.  But, today, the Court can stay silent no longer.  Its decision overrides the intent of Congress—and the policy preferences of the constituents that body represents—as unequivocally expressed by the plain text of the statute.  Respectfully, I dissent.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">&nbsp;I</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Section 666 is a relatively recent solution to an old problem.  It seeks to ensure that “taxpayer dollars .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. are in fact spent for the general welfare, and not frittered away in graft.”  <em>Id</em>., at 605.  Accordingly, the statute applies to certain entities that receive a threshold amount of federal funds.  It covers any “agent of an organization, or of a State, local, or Indian tribal government, or any agency thereof.”  §666(a)(1).  The entity must “receiv[e], in any one year period, benefits in excess of $10,000 under a Federal program involving a .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. form of Federal assistance.”  §666(b).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> If an entity meets that description, the statute imposes federal criminal penalties on any agent who</p>\n<p class=\"bqonly1para jy-both\">“corruptly solicits or demands for the benefit of any person, or accepts or agrees to accept, anything of value from any person, intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with any business, transaction, or series of transactions of such organization, government, or agency involving any thing of value of $5,000 or more.”  §666(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">In short, §666(a)(1)(B) makes it a federal crime for state, local, or tribal officials to corruptly solicit, accept, or agree to accept certain payments in connection with business worth $5,000 or more.  A neighboring provision similarly imposes penalties on the giver—<em>i.e.</em>,<em> </em>anyone who “corruptly gives, offers, or agrees to give” payments “with intent to influence or reward” these officials.  §666(a)(2).  For offenders of either provision, the penalty is a fine, a maximum of 10 years in prison, or both.  §666(a).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> There is no dispute that §666 criminalizes bribes.  See <em>ante,</em> at 1.  This Court has also been clear about what a bribe requires: “a <em>quid pro quo</em>.”  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Sun-Diamond Growers of Cal.</em>, <a aria-label=\"526 U. S. 398\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/526/398\">526 U.&nbsp;S. 398</a>, 404 (1999).  A <em>quid pro quo</em> means “a specific intent to give or receive something of value <em>in exchange</em> for an official act.”  <em>Id</em>., at 404–405.  So, &nbsp;for a payment to constitute a bribe, there must be an upfront agreement to exchange the payment for taking an official action.  See <em>ibid</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Legislatures have also considered it similarly wrongful for government officials to accept gratuities under certain circumstances, but unlike bribes, gratuities do not have a <em>quid pro quo </em>requirement.  Generally speaking, rather than an actual agreement to take payment as the impetus for engaging in an official act (a <em>quid pro quo</em> exchange), gratuities “may constitute merely a reward for some future act that the public official will take (and may already have determined to take), or for a past act that he has already taken.”  <em>Id</em>., at 405.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> We took this case to resolve “[w]hether section 666 criminalizes gratuities, <em>i</em>.<em>e</em>., payments in recognition of actions the official has already taken or committed to take, without any quid pro quo agreement to take those actions.”  Pet. for Cert. I.  The majority today answers no, when the answer to that question should be an unequivocal yes.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">II</h3>\n<h4 class=\"jy-center\">A</h4>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> To reach the right conclusion we need not march through various auxiliary analyses: We can begin—and end—with only the text.  See <em>National Assn. of Mfrs.</em> v. <em>Department of Defense</em>, <a aria-label=\"583 U. S. 109\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/583/109\">583 U.&nbsp;S. 109</a>, 127 (2018).  We “understan[d] that Congress says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.”  <em>Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co.</em> v. <em>Union Planters Bank, N.&nbsp;A.</em>, <a aria-label=\"530 U. S. 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/530/1\">530 U.&nbsp;S. 1</a>, 6 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">1</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> By its plain terms, §666 imposes criminal penalties on state, local, and tribal officials who “corruptly” solicit, accept, or agree to accept “anything of value from any person, intending to be influenced or rewarded.”  §666(a)(1)(B).  Use &nbsp;of the term “influenced” captures <em>quid pro quo</em> bargains struck before an official act is taken—and therefore bribes—as everyone agrees.  Brief for Petitioner 17; Brief for United States 21; cf. <em>Sun-Diamond</em>, 526 U.&nbsp;S., at 404–405.  The term “rewarded” easily covers the concept of gratuities paid to corrupt officials after the fact—no upfront agreement necessary.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> As a general matter (and setting aside for the moment that §666 covers only officials who act “corruptly”), everyone knows what a reward is.  It is a $20 bill pulled from a lost wallet at the time of its return to its grateful owner.  A surprise ice cream outing after a report card with straight As.  The bar tab picked up by a supervisor celebrating a job well done by her team.  A reward often says “thank you” or “good job,” rather than “please.”</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Dictionary definitions confirm what common sense tells us about what it means to be rewarded.  A “reward” is “[t]hat which is given in return for good or evil done or received,” including “that which is offered or given for some service or attainment.”  Webster’s New International Dictionary 2136 (2d ed. 1957).  The verb form of the word is no different.  To “reward” means “to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. recompense.”  <em>Ibid</em>. (defining “to reward” as “[t]o make a return, or give a reward, to (a person) or for (a service, etc.); to requite; recompense; repay”).  Both definitions thus encompass payment in recognition of an action that an official has already taken or committed to taking.  And neither requires there to be some beforehand agreement about that exchange, <em>i</em>.<em>e</em>., a <em>quid pro quo</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Snyder concedes that the term “rewarded” can encompass the concept of gratuities.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 5; see also Reply Brief 3 (quoting <em>Sun-Diamond</em>, 526 U.&nbsp;S., at 405).  The majority—which doesn’t bother to interpret “rewarded” until the end of its opinion—eventually admits the same.  See <em>ante,</em> at 15 (“[T]he word ‘rewarded’ could be part of a gratuities statute”).  By that point in its analysis, however, &nbsp;the majority has already characterized §666 as a bribery statute.  And then, because we typically seek to give effect to each word of a statute, see <em>TRW Inc.</em> v. <em>Andrews</em>, <a aria-label=\"534 U. S. 19\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/534/19\">534 U.&nbsp;S. 19</a>, 31 (2001), the majority must strain to make the word “rewarded” as it appears in §666 relevant, rather than meaningless.  It offers rank speculation as to why “rewarded” in §666 might mean something other than what it ordinarily does, ultimately assigning the word some busy work relating to potential defenses to bribery charges.  See <em>ante</em>, at 15.  But whatever the merits of the majority’s assertions involving waterfronts, belts, and suspenders, its interpretation of §666 finds little grounding in the actual text of the statute.  See <em>Luna Perez</em> v. <em>Sturgis Public Schools</em>, <a aria-label=\"598 U. S. 142\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/598/142\">598 U.&nbsp;S. 142</a>, 150 (2023) (“&nbsp;‘[W]e cannot replace the actual text with speculation as to Congress’ intent’&nbsp;”).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">2</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Speaking of text: The language of other statutes demonstrates that Congress uses the word “reward” when it wants to criminalize gratuities.  For example, in <a aria-label=\"18 USC 1912\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1912\">18 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §1912</a>, Congress imposed criminal penalties on any federal officer “engaged in inspection of vessels” who “receives any fee or <em>reward</em> for his services, except what is allowed to him by law.”  (Emphasis added.)  And in <a aria-label=\"22 USC 4202\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/4202\">22 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §4202</a>, Congress provided for the sanctioning of “any consular officer&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;who demands or receives for any official services&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. any fee or <em>reward</em> other than the fee provided by law for such service.” (Emphasis added.)  Snyder admits that these statutes target gratuities by virtue of Congress’s use of the term “reward.”  Brief for Petitioner 31.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> But rather than simply calling a statute that penalizes accepting a “reward” for public business what it is—a wrongful or illegal gratuities statute—the majority insists that, sometimes, when Congress uses “reward,” it is still just criminalizing <em>quid pro quo</em> bribery, mustering up examples to show that “bribery statutes sometimes use the &nbsp;term ‘reward.’&nbsp;”  <em>Ante,</em> at 15.  However, none of the majority’s examples use the term “reward” in a way that is relevantly similar to §666.  For one thing, the majority’s examples do not use the phrase “influenced or rewarded” to delineate between bribes and gratuities, while covering both, as §666 does.  In addition, each of the statutes the majority points to explicitly links the forbidden “reward” to an agreement to take some specific action; in other words, the majority’s examples specify, by their plain text, a <em>quid pro quo</em>.  For example, <a aria-label=\"18 USC 600\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/600\">18 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §600</a> imposes federal criminal penalties on anyone who “promises,” <em>inter alia</em>, jobs or benefits “provided for or made possible in whole or in part by any Act of Congress” to another person “as consideration, favor, or reward for” certain political activity.  That statute identifies both a forbidden <em>quid</em> (a future job) and <em>quo</em> (political activity).<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Jackson Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-1\" id=\"DISSENT_6-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In contrast with those statutes, when §666 uses “rewarded,” it never connects that term to some upfront exchange.  What the majority’s examples actually show, then, is that when Congress wants to use the term “reward” to encompass only bribes, it knows just how to do so.  See <em>Henson</em> v. <em>Santander Consumer USA Inc</em>., <a aria-label=\"582 U. S. 79\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/582/79\">582 U.&nbsp;S. 79</a>, 86 (2017) (“[W]e presume differences in language like this convey differences in meaning”).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> In an attempt to shore up its unnatural reading of §666, the majority turns to statutory and legislative history.  <em>Ante,</em> at 5, 8–9.  Where appropriate, I, too, find statutory and legislative history to be useful tools that this Court can and should consult.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Delaware</em> v. <em>Pennsylvania</em>, &nbsp;<a aria-label=\"598 U. S. 115\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/598/115\">598 U.&nbsp;S. 115</a>, 138–139 (2023).  But resort to these tools is questionable under certain circumstances.  See <em>Milner</em> v. <em>Department of Navy</em>, <a aria-label=\"562 U. S. 562\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/562/562\">562 U.&nbsp;S. 562</a>, 574 (2011) (“When presented, on the one hand, with clear statutory language and, on the other, with dueling committee reports, we must choose the language”).  In any event, here, the statutory and legislative history only make matters worse for the majority’s analysis.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Section 666 traces its lineage to <a aria-label=\"18 USC 201\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/201\">18 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;§201</a>, though the kinship is more attenuated than the majority lets on.  Section 201 indeed “contains comprehensive prohibitions on bribes and gratuities to federal officials.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 4 (discussing §§201(b)–(c)).  But initially, it was not entirely clear <em>which</em> officials that federal statute covered.  By its terms, §201 applies broadly to “public officials,” see §201(a), and confusion arose among some lower courts as to “whether state and local employees could be considered ‘public officials’&nbsp;” under the statute.  <em>Salinas</em>, 522 U.&nbsp;S., at 58.  Without awaiting our resolution of the issue, Congress enacted §666 in 1984.  <em>Ibid</em>.; see also <a href=\"/rio/citation/98_Stat._2143\">98 Stat. 2143</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In §666, Congress expressly sought to reach state and local officials “to protect the integrity of the vast sums of money distributed through Federal programs.”  S.&nbsp;Rep. No.&nbsp;98–225, p.&nbsp;370 (1983).  As originally enacted, §666 barred those officials from soliciting, accepting, or agreeing to accept “anything of value .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for or because of the recipient’s conduct,” §666(b) (1982 ed., Supp. II), using language similar to that in §201(c), the federal-official gratuities provision.  Crucially, no one disputes that when it was initially enacted, §666 prohibited <em>both bribes and gratuities</em>.  <em>Ante,</em> at 4.  Similarly significant (though unmentioned by the majority), Congress imposed the same 10-year maximum term of imprisonment for a violation then as it does now.  See §666(b) (1982 ed., Supp. II); cf. <em>ante,</em> at 14 (describing it as “unfathomable that Congress would authorize a 10-year &nbsp;criminal sentence for gifts to 19 million state and local officials” without federal guidance).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Starting with this historical disadvantage regarding the scope of the statute, the majority must show that Congress made major changes to §666 that might account for the sans-gratuity interpretation the majority adopts today.  But several features of the statutory and legislative history convince me of the opposite.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> For one, Congress said that it was <em>not</em> making major changes to the statute.  The 1986 revisions to §666 were part of a package of changes that Congress specifically deemed “technical and minor.”  H.&nbsp;R. Rep. No. 99–797, p.&nbsp;16 (1986); see also Criminal Law and Procedure Technical Amendments Act of 1986, <a href=\"/rio/citation/100_Stat._3592\">100 Stat. 3592</a>.  And the revisions themselves are largely in keeping with this characterization.  Relevant here, Congress teased out a “corruptly” <em>mens rea</em> requirement and swapped the previous “for or because of&nbsp;” language for the current “intending to be influenced or rewarded” phrasing.  <em>Id</em>., at 3613.  None of this, on its face, evinces clear congressional intent to extract an entire category of previously covered illicit payments from §666.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Undeterred, the majority says that when Congress amended §666, it was attempting to fashion that provision after §201(b)—the bribery statute that covers federal officials.  See <em>ante,</em> at 8–9.<a aria-label=\"reference 2 of Jackson Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-2\" id=\"DISSENT_6-2ref\"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a>  Again, the statutory and legislative record suggests otherwise: In fact, history establishes that Congress had a different model statute in mind.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Congress had used a phrase identical to §666’s “intending to be influenced or rewarded” language just a few months before when it amended <a aria-label=\"18 USC 215\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/215\">18 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §215</a>, an anticorruption statute that applies to bank employees.  See <a href=\"/rio/citation/100_Stat._779\">100 Stat. 779</a>.  &nbsp;That provision imposes criminal penalties on any bank employee who “corruptly solicits or demands .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or corruptly accepts or agrees to accept, anything of value from any person, <em>intending to be influenced or rewarded</em> in connection with any business or transaction.” <em>Ibid</em>. (emphasis added); see also §215(a)(2).  And this similarity was no coincidence.  The House Report the majority quotes as explicating §666 confirms that §666 <em>was meant to track §215</em>—not §201(b), as the majority claims.  See H.&nbsp;R. Rep. No. 99–797, at&nbsp;30, n.&nbsp;9.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This means, of course, that if §215 criminalizes gratuities, it is likely §666 does as well.  But the majority labels §215 “a null data point,” evidently because this Court has never interpreted that statute.  <em>Ante,</em> at 9, n.&nbsp;4.  Section 215’s relevance to §666 does not come from any interpretation, however—it is plain on the face of that statute, which uses the exact same “influenced or rewarded” phrase.  And the history of that model provision indicates that Congress meant for §215 to reach gratuities, too.  For example, a House Report directly speaks of §215 as a statute criminalizing gratuities: It says that, before 1986, §215 made “it criminal for a bank official to accept any <em>gratuity</em>, no matter how trivial, after that official ha[d] taken official action on bank business.”  H.&nbsp;R. Rep. No. 99–335, p.&nbsp;6, n.&nbsp;25 (1985) (emphasis added).  Congress amended §215 in 1986 to “narro[w]” the statute, but not by carving out gratuities altogether.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Rather it narrowed the “law by requiring that the acceptance of the <em>gratuity</em> be done <em>corruptly</em>.”  <em>Ibid</em>. (emphasis added).<a aria-label=\"reference 3 of Jackson Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-3\" id=\"DISSENT_6-3ref\"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></a>  Astute readers will recall that Congress made exactly this same narrowing edit to §666.  See <em>supra</em>, &nbsp;at 9.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In short, Congress tailored §215 in an effort to stem “&nbsp;‘corruption in the bank industry,’&nbsp;” and it seemed to think that <em>both</em> bribes <em>and</em> gratuities contributed to that problem.  H.&nbsp;R. Rep. No. 99–335, at<em> </em>5.  So, too, with §666 and public corruption.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">III</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> To recap what we know thus far: The question in this case is whether §666 criminalizes gratuities in addition to bribes.  The text and purpose of §666 alone provide an easy answer.  The word “rewarded” means to have been given a reward for some action taken.  So gratuities are plainly covered.  To be sure, if the Court had given that straightforward answer, we might eventually have confronted a followup question: Are <em>all</em> gratuities covered?  Said differently: Even if gratuities generally are criminalized by §666, are there circumstances in which certain gratuities are <em>not </em>criminalized?</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The case in front of us does not require us to reach that question.  We have not been asked to settle, once and for all, which gratuities are corrupt and which are quotidian.  Snyder did not argue that his $13,000 check was part of some subset of noncriminalized gratuities.  Rather (and this is important to note), Snyder has taken an all-or-nothing approach to the argument he makes in this case.  He insists that <em>all</em> gratuities—every type in the entire class—are excluded from §666.  Because the statute’s plain text says otherwise, that should have been the end of this case, even if a future petitioner might have asked us to do a more nuanced analysis.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> But, no matter—the majority today skips ahead, complaining that the Government has “not identif[ied] any remotely clear lines separating an innocuous or obviously benign gratuity from a criminal gratuity.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 12.  This omission is a huge problem, the majority says, because &nbsp;without those lines, “19 million state and local officials” could be imprisoned “for accepting even commonplace gratuities.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 1.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The majority’s fretting falls flat, especially in the context of <em>this</em> case.  There is no question that state, local, and tribal officials deserve “clear lines,” but we were not asked to provide all of them at this moment.<a aria-label=\"reference 4 of Jackson Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-4\" id=\"DISSENT_6-4ref\"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup></a>  And, perhaps even more important, nothing about the facts of this case even remotely implicates a reasonable concern about the criminalization of innocuous conduct on the part of an unwary official.  Furthermore, most of the clear lines the majority seeks already exist—they come from the text of the statute.  Limits within the text of §666 provide “fair notice” that commonplace gratuities are typically not within the statute’s reach, contra, <em>ante,</em> at 11, and they suffice to prevent prosecution of the gift cards, burrito bowls, and steak dinners that derail today’s decision.<a aria-label=\"reference 5 of Jackson Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-5\" id=\"DISSENT_6-5ref\"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">A</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> If one simply accepts what the statute says it covers—local officials who corruptly solicit, accept, or agree to accept rewards in connection with official business worth over a certain amount—Snyder’s case is an easy one.  Perhaps that is why the majority spends so little time describing it.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Snyder took office as mayor of the city of Portage, Indiana, in January 2012.  As mayor, Snyder and his appointees &nbsp;sat on the Portage Board of Works and Public Safety, the entity that managed public bidding on city contracts.  Snyder put one of his friends, Randy Reeder, in charge of the bidding process, despite Reeder’s lack of experience in administering public bids.  Evidence presented at Snyder’s trial showed that Reeder tailored bid specifications for two different city contracts to favor Great Lakes Peterbilt, a truck dealership owned by brothers Robert Buha and Stephen Buha.  Evidence also showed that during the bidding process, Snyder was in contact with the Buha brothers, but no other bidders.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Snyder had campaigned on a platform that included automating trash collection, and by December 2012, the city was looking to buy three garbage trucks.  It issued an invitation to bid on the contract, listing specific requirements for the trucks.  Reeder testified that he crafted some specifications, including delivery within 150 days, knowing they would favor Great Lakes Peterbilt.  The board of works voted to award Great Lakes Peterbilt the contract.  Evidence at trial showed that the city could have saved about $60,000 had it not prioritized expedited delivery.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In January 2013, the manager of Great Lakes Peterbilt asked Reeder whether the city might want to buy another truck—an unused, 2012 model that had been sitting outside on the dealership’s lot over two winters.  Snyder first tried to buy the truck outright, but Portage’s city attorney informed him he had to go through the public bidding process.  So the board of works issued another invitation to bid in November 2013.  This invitation sought two more garbage trucks.  Reeder again tweaked certain specifications to favor Great Lakes Peterbilt—this time to help it move the older truck sitting on its lot.  The board of works voted to award Great Lakes Peterbilt this contract too.  Together, the two contracts that Great Lakes Peterbilt “won” totaled some $1.125 million.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Shortly after the second contract was awarded, Snyder &nbsp;paid the Buha brothers a visit at their dealership.  “I need money,” he said.  App. 72.  He asked for $15,000; the dealership gave him $13,000.  When federal investigators heard about the payment and came calling, Snyder told them the check was for information technology and health insurance consulting services that he had provided to the dealership.  He gave different explanations for the money to Reeder and a different city employee.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Employees at Great Lakes Peterbilt testified that Snyder never performed any consulting work for the dealership.  And during the federal investigation, no written agreements, work product, evidence of meetings, invoices, or other documentation was ever produced relating to any consulting work performed by Snyder.  All of this confirmed testimony from the dealership’s controller, who had cut the check to Snyder: Snyder had instead been paid for an “&nbsp;‘inside track. ’&nbsp;”  App. to Pet. for Cert. 60a–61a.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> A federal grand jury charged Snyder with violating <a aria-label=\"18 USC 666 a 1 B\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/666#a_1_B\">18 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §666(a)(1)(B)</a>.  App. 2–3.  The indictment alleged that Snyder “did corruptly solicit, demand, accept, and agree to accept a bank check in the amount of $13,000, intending to be influenced and rewarded.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 3.<em> </em>A jury found him guilty of violating §666 in connection with the garbage truck contracts.  It is not difficult to see why the jury reached that conclusion, having been instructed that the Government needed to prove that Snyder “acted corruptly, with the intent to be influenced or rewarded.”  <em>Id</em>., at 27.<a aria-label=\"reference 6 of Jackson Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-6\" id=\"DISSENT_6-6ref\"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">&nbsp;B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> One thing is clear from the Court’s opinion in this case—the majority isn’t much worried about what happens to Snyder under §666.  It pivots to the other 18,999,999 state, local, and tribal officials at work throughout the country and laments that there are “no clear federal rules” for them.  <em>Ante,</em> at 12.  But §666 was not designed to apply to teachers accepting fruit baskets, soccer coaches getting gift cards, or newspaper delivery guys who get a tip at Christmas.  See <em>ibid.</em> (reciting similar examples).  We know this because, beyond requiring acceptance of a reward, §666 weaves together multiple other elements (that the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt), which collectively do the nuanced work of sifting illegal gratuities from inoffensive ones.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Those limits are clear on the face of the statute; when construed as a whole, the text of §666 provides more than adequate notice to those this statute covers.  Now, for a list of my own: <em>First</em>, §666 applies only when a state, local, tribal, or private entity “receives, in any one year period, benefits in excess of $10,000 under a Federal program involving” some “form of Federal assistance.”  §666(b).  <em>Second</em>, the statute requires that the criminalized payment be “in connection with any business, transaction, or series of transactions” of the covered entity.  §§666(a)(1)(B), (a)(2).  <em>Third</em>, that “business, transaction, or series of transactions” must involve “[some]thing of value of $5,000 or more.”  <em>Ibid</em>.  <em>Fourth</em>, §666 expressly “does not apply to bona fide salary, wages, fees, or other compensation paid .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in the usual course of business.”  §666(c).  Nor does it apply to “expenses paid or reimbursed .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in the usual course of business.”  <em>Ibid</em>.  <em>Last</em>, and perhaps most important, the statute specifically requires that the official who solicits, accepts, or agrees to accept the payment do so “corruptly” (the <em>mens rea</em>).  §666(a)(1)(B).  This series of carefully delineated circumstances—all of which appear in the text of §666—means that payments or gifts to officials will not always be captured by §666 under any and all circumstances, but only if the violator acts in the ways described and with the required intent.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Notably, the majority takes the last statutory check I describe—the “corruptly” <em>mens rea</em> requirement—and transforms it into a reason to read the statute to cover only bribes.  See <em>ante,</em> at 7–8, 15.  The majority maintains that “corruptly” signals that §666 is a bribery statute because §201(b), the federal-official bribery statute, uses that term.  <em>Ibid</em>.  But, as I have already explained, the bribery statute for federal officials is not the blueprint the majority makes it out to be.  See Part II–B, <em>supra</em>.  And while the majority suggests that “corruptly” just means <em>quid pro quo</em>, see <em>ante,</em> at 8, it can give no reason why that must be so in <em>this </em>statute.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Instead, the majority gives a practical justification for its preferred interpretation.  It suggests that if §666 is read generally to apply to gratuities, and “corruptly” is read as a narrowing <em>mens rea</em> element, then the statute <em>still</em> might sweep in all sorts of innocuous gifts.  See <em>ante,</em> at 12–13.  Maybe.  Maybe not.  Again, the precise meaning of the term “corruptly” is not the question before us today.  Nor does it really matter here because, whatever “corruptly” means, Snyder’s behavior clearly fits the bill, making this case a poor one to explore the contours of that term.  See Part III–A, <em>supra</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In any event, any uncertainty we might have about “corruptly” seems unwarranted considering the Court’s previous definitions of that word.  In <em>Arthur Andersen LLP</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"544 U.S. 696\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/544/696\">544 U.&nbsp;S. 696 (2005)</a>, we wrote that the term &nbsp;“&nbsp;‘corruptly’&nbsp;” is “normally associated with wrongful, immoral, depraved, or evil” conduct.  <em>Id</em>., at 705.  We therefore related the term with “consciousness of wrongdoing.”  <em>Id</em>., at 706.  Applying that standard definition to §666’s <em>mens rea</em> requirement appears to heave an imposing burden onto the Government.  Prosecutors must prove not only that a state, local, or tribal official did, in fact, act wrongfully when accepting the gift or payment, but also that she <em>knew</em> that accepting the gift or payment was wrongful.<a aria-label=\"reference 7 of Jackson Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-7\" id=\"DISSENT_6-7ref\"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup></a>  The majority worries that it may be unclear to an official whether accepting a gift is, in fact, “wrongful.”  See <em>ante,</em> at 12.  But if “corruptly” is read to require knowledge of wrongfulness, any lack of clarity benefits the official.  In such circumstances, a prosecutor is almost certain to be unable to meet her burden of proof—as the Government acknowledges.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., Tr. of Oral Arg. 59–60, 107.<a aria-label=\"reference 8 of Jackson Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-8\" id=\"DISSENT_6-8ref\"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The bottom line is that §666 is not unique or special.  Like other criminal statutes—and especially other anti-public-corruption statutes—§666 has various elements, some of which may benefit from further clarification.  Down the road, this Court could have had that opportunity with respect to §666 <em>if</em> it had chosen to engage in our usual method of parsing statutes.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Fischer</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"529 U. S. 667\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/529/667\">529 U.&nbsp;S. 667</a>, 677, 681 (2000) (clarifying the meaning of federal “benefits” under §666); <em>Sun-Diamond</em>, 526 U.&nbsp;S., at 414 (holding that to establish a violation of §201(c), “the Government must prove a link between a thing of value conferred upon a public official and a <em>specific </em>‘official act’ for or &nbsp;because of which it was given” (emphasis added)); <em>McDonnell</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"579 U. S. 550\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/579/550\">579 U.&nbsp;S. 550</a>, 571–572 (2016) (clarifying the “official act” requirement in §201(a)(3)).  Instead, the majority washes its hands of this anticorruption provision, announcing that certain wrongful conduct the statute plainly covers just cannot be included.  The majority throws in the towel too soon.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">C</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> As I said earlier, §666 already provides meaningful guardrails that protect against the “overbreadth” that the majority decries.  <em>Ante,</em> at 12.  But you don’t have to take my word for that.  Other prosecutions of gratuities that the Government has brought under §666—successfully or unsuccessfully—do not remotely resemble the holiday tips, gift baskets, and sweatshirts around which the majority crafts its decision.<a aria-label=\"reference 9 of Jackson Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-9\" id=\"DISSENT_6-9ref\"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup></a>  That is, even as the Government has consistently maintained that §666 covers gratuities, its actual prior prosecutions under §666 were not the dragnet for public school teachers, soccer coaches, or trash collectors that the majority conjures.  Rather, the real cases in which the Government has invoked this law involve <em>exactly</em> the &nbsp;type of palm greasing that the statute plainly covers and that one might reasonably expect Congress to care about when targeting graft in state, local, and tribal governments.  After today, however, the ability of the Federal Government to prosecute such obviously wrongful conduct is left in doubt.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> It is also noteworthy that the prosecutions that Snyder describes as proof of the Government’s “not reassuring” track record, Reply Brief 18–19, look nothing like the acts of gratitude that worry the majority.  The “city building inspector [who] solicit[ed] donations for his favorite youth sports league”?  <em>Id</em>., at 18.  Well, he admitted to receiving illegal gratuities from an engineer who worked with clients seeking building permits in San Francisco.  The engineer knew that the inspector was a volunteer coach and supporter of “a San Francisco non-profit adult and youth athletic organization,” and the engineer arranged for his clients to donate to that organization in connection with inspections of their properties.  Press Release, U.&nbsp;S. Attorney’s Office, ND Cal., San Francisco Senior Building Inspector Pleads Guilty to Accepting Illegal Gratuities (Dec. 9, 2022). <em> </em>“[I]n several instances, the engineer advised [the inspector] of a client’s donation while asking for a final permit or inspection on the client’s property.”  <em>Ibid</em>.  That same inspector also accepted $30,000 in debt forgiveness from a longtime San Francisco real-estate developer and friend.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> And the “county contractor [who] donat[ed] $2,000 for plaques and food at a luncheon honoring female judges”?  Reply Brief 18.  He was the owner of a debt collection company that had a nonexclusive contract with Cook County, Illinois, to perform debt collection work.  A significant part of the contract was the chance to collect fines owed on unpaid traffic tickets.  An official in the Circuit Court of Cook County Clerk’s Office—the entity responsible for doling out the traffic debt work—gave his firm half of those collections.  &nbsp;The owner then underwrote nearly $2,000 in expenses for the court’s Women’s History Month Celebration.  Why did he cover these expenses?  “We gotta stay ahead of [the competition],” the owner told his staff.  <em>United States </em>v. <em>Donagher</em>, No. 1:19–cr–00240 (ND Ill.), ECF Doc. 98, pp. 2–5.<a aria-label=\"reference 10 of Jackson Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-10\" id=\"DISSENT_6-10ref\"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> None of this means that courts should trust the Government when it says that it does and will continue to enforce a statute with care.  That is not how we do statutory interpretation, and for good reason.  See <em>Marinello</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"584 U. S. 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/584/1\">584 U.&nbsp;S. 1</a>, 11 (2018).  But what these examples do show is that §666’s built-in bulwarks seem to be working.  Thus, there is simply no reason to think that decades after &nbsp;the courts of appeals first interpreted §666 to cover gratuities, reading the statute to do so now will “suddenly subject 19 million state and local officials to a new and different regulatory regime.”  <em>Ante,</em> at 11.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">IV</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Ultimately, it appears that the real bone the majority has to pick with §666 is its concern about overregulation—a concern born of the relationship between federal and state governance.  The majority’s pages of citations to state and local gratuities laws, <em>ante,</em> at 2–3, thus belie its ranking so-called “federalism” interests merely “[f]ifth” on its list of reasons for construing §666 as a bribery-only statute, <em>ante,</em> at 10 (emphasis deleted).  More than anything, it seems that the majority itself harbors the belief it repeatedly ascribes to Congress: that regulation of gratuities is better left to state, local, and tribal governments, rather than the Federal Government.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>ante,</em> at 11, 16.  (No word on why the same could not be said for bribes.)</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> If Congress shared those policy concerns, however, it chose not to act upon them in this statute.  Instead, Congress reached out to regulate state, local, and tribal entities as well as other organizations that receive federal funds, despite the fact that those governments do have their own ethics regulations, as the majority is quick to point out.  And, of course, if the majority is correct about Congress’s commitment to federalism principles in this area, one wonders why Congress didn’t just leave state, local, and tribal entities alone.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Quite to the contrary, Congress chose to enact §666 “to ensure the integrity of organizations participating in federal assistance programs.”  <em>Fischer</em>, 529 U.&nbsp;S., at 678.  And that choice was intentional—Congress acted to “addres[s] a legitimate federal concern by licensing federal prosecution in an area historically of state concern.”  <em>Sabri</em>, 541 U.&nbsp;S., at 608, n.  Snyder apparently objects to this policy choice, &nbsp;and further complained below that “Congress ha[d] yet to take up” any invitation “to consider rewriting the provision.” App. 15.  Fortunately for him, today’s decision by this Court accomplishes exactly that result.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">*  *  *</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> State, local, and tribal governments have an important role to play in combating public corruption, and, of course, their regulations should reflect the values of the communities they serve.  I wholeheartedly agree with the majority’s suggestion that, because employees of those governments are our neighbors, friends, and hometown heroes, federal law ought not be read to subject them to prosecution when grateful members of the community show their thanks.  See <em>ante,</em> at 1.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> But nothing about the facts of this case implicates any of that kind of conduct.  And the text of §666 clearly covers the kind of corrupt (albeit perhaps non-<em>quid pro quo</em>) payment Snyder solicited after steering the city contracts to the dealership.  Because reading §666 to prohibit gratuities—just as it always has—poses no genuine threat to common gift giving, but does honor Congress’s intent to punish rewards corruptly accepted by government officials in ways that are functionally indistinguishable from taking a bribe, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<h3 class=\"fnheader\">Notes</h3>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_6-1\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Jackson Dissent at reference 1\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-1ref\">1</a> &nbsp;See also <a aria-label=\"33 USC 447\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/33/447\">33 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;§447</a> (imposing penalties on “[e]very person who&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. gives any sum of money or other bribe, present, or reward .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to any .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. employee of the office of any supervisor of a harbor with intent to influence such .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. employee to permit or overlook any violation of the provisions of this subchapter”).</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_6-2\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Jackson Dissent at reference 2\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-2ref\">2</a> &nbsp;Section 201(b)(2)(A) imposes federal criminal penalties on “[w]hoever .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. being a public official .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. corruptly demands, seeks, receives, accepts, or agrees to receive or accept anything of value .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in return for .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. being influenced in the performance of any official act.”</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_6-3\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Jackson Dissent at reference 3\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_6-3ref\">3</a> &nbsp;Piling on, I note that the 1986 amendments to §215 also required federal agencies with responsibility for regulating a financial institution to “establish .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. guidelines” to help bank employees comply with the statute.

The District Court specifically found that, “even if&nbsp;” §666 were construed to penalize bribes alone, “there was ample evidence permitting a rational jury to find, from the circumstantial evidence, that there was an up-front agreement to reward Snyder for making sure [Great Lakes Peterbilt] won the contract award(s).”  App. to Pet. for Cert. 63a.  Thus, the Seventh Circuit should have been permitted to assess in the first instance whether any instructional error was prejudicial.  Under our current precedent, Snyder is not entitled to automatic relief due to a mere instructional error.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Greer</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"593 U.

Snyder says <em>Hamilton</em> shows that the Government “has prosecuted campaign contributions.”  Reply Brief 19.  The defendant in <em>Hamilton</em> was a Dallas real-estate developer who “supported” local politicians.  46 F. 4th, at 391.  He gave money to a nonprofit owned and operated by the campaign manager of one such politician, a Dallas City Council member.  “Some of those donations were used for [the nonprofit’s] legitimate purposes; others were purportedly given to [the nonprofit], cashed by [the campaign manager], then given to [the politician] personally.”  <em>Ibid.</em>  Around an election cycle, “[the developer] was trying to secure some low-income-housing tax credits for one of his real-estate ventures, the Royal Crest project,” and that City Council member “lobbied to have the Royal Crest project included.”  <em>Ibid</em>.  “A few years later, [the developer] needed to get a paid-sick-leave ordinance on the ballot in the upcoming election.”  <em>Ibid</em>.  So he wrote a $7,000 check to a different member of the Dallas City Council, who made clear that the check “was not a loan” and “had nothing to do with the campaign.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 392.  A jury convicted the developer on two §666 counts, but the Fifth Circuit later vacated the convictions because, in its view, §666 did not criminalize gratuities.  <em>Id</em>., at 393, 399.On these facts, it is far from clear that <em>Hamilton </em>involved legitimate campaign contributions.  But it is abundantly clear that Snyder’s case does not.  If a §666 conviction involving <em>real</em> campaign contributions had reached us, it might have been appropriate to read a <em>quid pro quo</em> requirement into the statute for that particular context.

Before the law could take effect, the Federal Government sued the State under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA).  That law requires a Medicare-funded hospital to provide essential care to patients experiencing medical emergencies.  The Government’s suit contended that EMTALA preempts the Idaho abortion law in a narrow class of cases: when the state law bars a hospital from performing an abortion needed to prevent serious health harms.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The District Court, believing the Government was likely &nbsp;to prevail in its suit, entered a preliminary injunction.  During the year that the injunction was in place, women in Idaho were able to obtain abortions in medical emergencies.  Idaho meanwhile sought to get the injunction lifted.  When the en banc Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit declined to stay the injunction, Idaho filed an emergency application here.  This Court stayed the injunction and granted the State’s petition for certiorari before judgment.  With that stay in effect, Idaho could enforce its abortion ban even when terminating a pregnancy was necessary to prevent grave harm to the woman.  The on-the-ground impact was immediate.  To ensure appropriate medical care, the State’s largest provider of emergency services had to airlift pregnant women out of Idaho roughly every other week, compared to once in all of the prior year (when the injunction was in effect).  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 66, 113.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> I concur in the Court’s decision today to vacate its stay and dismiss the writ of certiorari before judgment as improvidently granted.  I do so because Idaho’s arguments about EMTALA do not justify, and have never justified, either emergency relief or our early consideration of this dispute.  With this Court’s writ of certiorari dismissed, the lower courts can proceed with this litigation in the regular course.  And with this Court’s stay dissolved, the District Court’s preliminary injunction will again take effect.  That will prevent Idaho from enforcing its abortion ban when the termination of a pregnancy is needed to prevent serious harms to a woman’s health.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">I</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> EMTALA requires hospitals to provide abortions that Idaho’s law prohibits.  When that is so, Idaho’s law is preempted.  The Court’s ruling today follows from those premises.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Federal law and Idaho law are in conflict about the treatment of pregnant women facing health emergencies.  &nbsp;EMTALA requires a Medicare-funded hospital to offer an abortion when needed to stabilize a medical condition that seriously threatens a pregnant woman’s life or health.  See <a aria-label=\"42 USC 1395dd\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1395dd\">42 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §1395dd</a>.  Idaho allows abortions only when “necessary to prevent” a pregnant woman’s “death.”  Idaho Code Ann. §18–622(2)(a)(i) (Supp. 2023).  By their terms, the two laws differ.  What falls in the gap between them are cases in which continuing a pregnancy does not put a woman’s life in danger, but still places her at risk of grave health consequences, including loss of fertility.  In that situation, federal law requires a hospital to offer an abortion, whereas Idaho law prohibits that emergency care.  And the record shows that, as a matter of medical reality, such cases exist.  For example, when a woman comes to an emergency room with PPROM, the serious risk she faces may not be of death but of damage to her uterus, preventing her from having children in the future.  See 2 App. 594; see also <em>id.</em>, at 615–616 (similar for pre-eclampsia).  Idaho has never suggested that its law would allow an abortion in those circumstances.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 23 (stating that although the threat of death need not be “imminen[t],” only that threat can justify an abortion); see also <em>id.</em>, at 25–28, 33–34.  That is why hospitals in Idaho have had to airlift medically fragile women to other States to receive abortions needed to prevent serious harms to their health.  See <em>id.</em>, at 66, 103–104, 113–115.  Those transfers measure the difference between the life-threatening conditions Idaho will allow hospitals to treat and the health-threatening conditions it will not, despite EMTALA’s command.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Given that conflict, I agree with the Court’s decision today to step back from its early intervention in this dispute.  In the first stage of this suit, the District Court considered both sides’ medical evidence and entered a preliminary injunction against Idaho’s law on the ground of preemption.  See 623 F.&nbsp;Supp. 3d 1096, 1103–1105, 1110, 1117 (2022).  &nbsp;After the Idaho Supreme Court construed the law, the District Court revisited its findings, and reaffirmed its entry of the injunction.  See 2023 WL 3284977, *1, *5 (May 4, 2023).  In line with standard practice, that decision now can go to the Court of Appeals, and the District Court can afterward consider further evidence and arguments for the purpose of final judgment.  Idaho is not entitled to anything more.  It mainly argues that EMTALA never requires a hospital to “offer medical treatments that violate state law,” even when they are needed to prevent substantial health harms.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 4.  In my view, that understanding of EMTALA is not “likely to succeed on the merits,” and so cannot support a stay of the injunction.  <em>Nken</em> v. <em>Holder</em>, <a aria-label=\"556 U. S. 418\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/556/418\">556 U.&nbsp;S. 418</a>, 434 (2009).  Neither does the State’s argument provide any basis for this Court to short-circuit the proceedings below.  Today’s ruling thus puts the case back where it belongs, and with the preliminary injunction in place.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">II</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> <span class=\"smallcaps\">Justice Alito</span>’s dissenting opinion requires a brief response.  His primary argument is that although EMTALA generally obligates hospitals to provide emergency medical care, it never demands that they offer an abortion—no matter how much that procedure is needed to prevent grave physical harm, or even death.  See <em>post</em>, at 4–15.  That view has no basis in the statute.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> EMTALA unambiguously requires that a Medicare-funded hospital provide whatever medical treatment is necessary to stabilize a health emergency—and an abortion, in rare situations, is such a treatment.  The statutory obligation kicks in when an individual arrives at a hospital with an “emergency medical condition,” which is one involving serious jeopardy to health.  §1395dd(e)(1)(A).  The hospital must then “stabilize” the condition.  §1395dd(b)(1)(A).  That means offering the medical treatment necessary to ensure that “no material deterioration of the condition” is likely to &nbsp;occur.  §1395dd(e)(3)(A).  The statute does not list particular treatments—for example, defibrillation, blood transfusion, or mechanical ventilation.  What it instead requires is the treatment that is medically appropriate to stabilize the patient.  And when a pregnancy goes terribly wrong, that treatment may be an abortion.  Termination of the pregnancy (which is often of a non-viable fetus) may be the only way to prevent a woman’s death or serious injury, including kidney failure or loss of fertility.  See 623 F.&nbsp;Supp. 3d, at 1101, 1103–1105.  I do not understand <span class=\"smallcaps\">Justice Alito </span>to dispute that medical fact.  And from that fact, a statutory obligation arises.  It does not matter that EMTALA “does not mention abortion.”  <em>Post</em>,<em> </em>at 12; see <em>post</em>, at 5.  Neither, as just noted, does EMTALA mention any other treatment.  The statute simply requires the hospital to offer the treatment necessary to prevent the emergency condition from spiraling downward.  And on rare occasions that means providing an abortion.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The statute’s references to protecting an “unborn child” do not lead to a different result.  Contrary to <span class=\"smallcaps\">Justice Alito</span>’s view, none alters EMTALA’s command when a pregnancy threatens the woman’s life or health.  Three of the four provisions <span class=\"smallcaps\">Justice Alito</span> cites concern the treatment of women in labor (including all those with healthy pregnancies).  Those provisions ensure that a hospital, in considering the transfer of a woman to another facility, takes account of risks to not only the woman but also her “unborn child.”  §1395dd(c)(1)(A)(ii), (2)(A), (e)(1)(B)(ii).  The provisions have no application to women who are not in labor, but instead are experiencing a different pregnancy-related condition.  The fourth provision (included within the definition of “emergency medical condition”) specifies that a hospital must treat a condition that “plac[es] the health of the individual (or, with respect to a pregnant woman, the health of the woman or her unborn child) in serious jeopardy.”  §1395dd(e)(1)(A)(i).  The parenthetical there, added &nbsp;in an amendment to EMTALA, ensures that a woman with no health risks of her own can demand emergency-room treatment if her fetus is in peril.  It does not displace the hospital’s duty to a woman whose life or health <em>is</em> in jeopardy, and who needs an abortion to stabilize her condition.  Then, the statute requires offering that treatment to the woman.<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Kagan Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_4-1\" id=\"CONCUR_4-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Because the Idaho law conflicts with that requirement—prevents hospitals from doing what EMTALA commands—the Court is right to dissolve its stay of the District Court’s injunction.  Doing so will again give Idaho women access to all the needed medical treatments that EMTALA guarantees.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<h3 class=\"fnheader\">Notes</h3>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"CONCUR_4-1\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Kagan Concurrence at reference 1\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#CONCUR_4-1ref\">1</a> The amendment’s history confirms that understanding.  As originally enacted, EMTALA did not obligate hospitals to provide medical care when a woman’s fetus, but not the woman herself, was in peril.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 105 (Solicitor General describing “well-publicized cases” where women’s “own health and life were not in danger, but the fetus was in grave distress and hospitals weren’t treating them”).  To fix that problem, very large bipartisan majorities in both the House and the Senate elected to broaden the provision, entitling a woman to demand care for her unborn child as well as herself.  See <a href=\"/rio/citation/103_Stat._2248\">103 Stat. 2248</a>; 135 Cong. Rec. 31431 (1989); <em>id.</em>, at 31127; <em>id.</em>, at 24605; <em>id.</em>, at 23393.  The amendment would likely have sparked far more opposition if it somehow tacitly withdrew EMTALA’s requirement that hospitals treat women who need an abortion to prevent death or serious harm.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"concurrence\">&nbsp;<hr>TOP\n<h2>Concurrence</h2>\n<div class=\"bodytext\">\n<p class=\"scusnameplate jy-center\">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p class=\"rule jy-center\">_________________</p>\n<p class=\"casenumber jy-center\">Nos. 23–726 and 23–727</p>\n<p class=\"rule jy-center\">_________________</p>\n<p class=\"videfirstline jy-center\">Mike Moyle, Speaker of the Idaho House of Representatives, <span class=\"smallcaps\">et&nbsp;al.</span>, PETITIONERS</p>\n<p class=\"v jy-left\">23–726 <em>v.</em></p>\n<p class=\"videsecondline jy-center\">United States</p>\n<p class=\"normal jy-both\"></p>\n<p class=\"videfirstline jy-center\">Idaho, PETITIONER</p>\n<p class=\"v jy-left\">23–727 <em>v.</em></p>\n<p class=\"videsecondline jy-center\">UNITED STATES</p>\n<h4 class=\"sylct-b sc-1 jy-center\">on writs of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</h4>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"opiniondates\">[June 26, 2024]</div>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"casct-a jy-both\"><span class=\"smallcaps\"> Justice Barrett</span>, with whom <span class=\"smallcaps\">The Chief Justice</span> and <span class=\"smallcaps\">Justice Kavanaugh</span> join, concurring.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> We granted certiorari before judgment in these cases to decide whether the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) preempts a provision of Idaho law that prohibits abortions except when necessary to save the life of the mother.  601 U.&nbsp;S. ___ (2024).  Because the shape of these cases has substantially shifted since we granted certiorari, I concur in the Court’s judgment dismissing the writ as improvidently granted.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">I</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> In 2022, the Department of Health and Human Services issued guidance to “remind hospitals of their existing obligation to comply with EMTALA.”  Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, Reinforcement of EMTALA Obligations Specific to Patients Who Are Pregnant or Are Experiencing Pregnancy Loss, Note, p.&nbsp;1 (July 11, 2022) (rev. Aug. 25, 2022) (italics deleted).  The guidance tells physicians that if &nbsp;they believe that “abortion is the stabilizing treatment necessary to resolve” a pregnant woman’s emergency medical condition, they “must provide that treatment.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 1 (italics and emphasis deleted).  Any contrary state law, the guidance continues, is “preempted.”  <em>Ibid</em>. (italics and emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Idaho’s Defense of Life Act criminalizes the performance of most abortions.  Idaho Code Ann. §18–622 (Supp. 2023).  As originally enacted, the Act allowed accused physicians to raise an affirmative defense that “the abortion was necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.”  §18–622(2)(a)(i).  Soon before the Act was set to take effect, the United States sued Idaho, seeking to enjoin Idaho’s law “to the extent it conflicts with EMTALA.”  1 App. 5.  EMTALA, the United States argued, requires physicians to perform abortions under certain circumstances that Idaho’s Act would forbid.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> After holding an evidentiary hearing, the District Court identified a conflict and granted a preliminary injunction.  623 F.&nbsp;Supp. 3d 1096 (Idaho 2022).  The court based its conclusion on three key assumptions: (1) The Act prohibits the termination of ectopic pregnancies; (2) the pregnant woman’s death must be objectively “imminent” or “certain” before a physician can perform an abortion; and (3) the “necessary to prevent death” exception is only an affirmative defense.  <em>Id</em>., at 1109–1114.  The Government’s witnesses, whose testimony the court credited, made similar assumptions.  <em>Id</em>., at 1104–1105.  They claimed that the Act might prohibit abortions as treatment for conditions including severe heart failure, pre-eclampsia, preterm premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM), sepsis, and placental abruption, because a physician could not know, “with certainty,” that an abortion is necessary to save the mother’s life in those circumstances.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., 1 App. 30–38.  They also assumed that the Act only permitted abortions where death was “imminent.”  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., 2 <em>id</em>., at 608.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; After the District Court ruled, the Idaho Supreme Court construed the Act.  That court explained that the Act “does not require <em>objective</em> certainty, or a particular level of immediacy, before the abortion can be ‘necessary’ to save the woman’s life.”  <em>Planned Parenthood Great Nw. </em>v.<em> State</em>, 171 Idaho 374, 445, 522 P.&nbsp;3d 1132, 1203 (2023).  And “treating an ectopic pregnancy, by removing the fetus,” the court concluded, does not count as an “&nbsp;‘abortion’&nbsp;” under the Act.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Without holding a new evidentiary hearing, the District Court denied Idaho’s motion for reconsideration.  2023 WL 3284977 (May 4, 2023).  The Idaho Legislature later amended the definition of “abortion” to exclude “[t]he removal of a dead unborn child” and “[t]he removal of an ectopic or molar pregnancy.”  §18–604(1)(b), (c).  It also changed the “life of the mother” affirmative defense into an exception from the prohibition on criminal abortions.  §18–622(2).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Ninth Circuit initially stayed the District Court’s injunction, 83 F. 4th 1130 (2023), but the en banc court vacated the panel’s stay, declined to stay the injunction, and scheduled oral argument on the merits, 82 F. 4th 1296 (2023).  We granted Idaho’s and the Legislature’s applications to stay the District Court’s injunction pending appeal, treated the applications as petitions for a writ of certiorari before judgment, and granted the petitions.  601 U.&nbsp;S. ___ (2024).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">II</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Before the Ninth Circuit had the opportunity to review the District Court’s preliminary injunction, this Court stayed the injunction and granted certiorari before judgment.  Both decisions were premised on the belief that Idaho would suffer irreparable harm under the injunction and that these cases were ready for the Court’s immediate determination.  Since then, briefing and oral argument &nbsp;have “shed more light on this case than in the nature of things was afforded at the time” the Court considered petitioners’ emergency applications.  <em>Belcher </em>v.<em> Stengel</em>, <a aria-label=\"429 U. S. 118\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/429/118\">429 U.&nbsp;S. 118</a>, 119 (1976) (<em>per&nbsp;curiam</em>) (dismissed as improvidently granted).  I am now convinced that these cases are no longer appropriate for early resolution.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The parties dispute whether EMTALA requires hospitals to provide abortions—or any other treatment forbidden by state law—as necessary stabilizing care.  They also disagree about whether EMTALA, as a statute enacted under Congress’s spending power and that operates on private parties, <em>can</em> preempt state law (an issue aired for the first time in this Court).  In my judgment, it would be imprudent to answer these important questions now.  Since this suit began in the District Court, Idaho law has significantly changed—twice.  And since we granted certiorari, the parties’ litigating positions have rendered the scope of the dispute unclear, at best.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In its stay application, Idaho argued that the Government’s interpretation of EMTALA would render Idaho’s Act virtually unenforceable.  As Idaho understood it, the Government’s theory would allow physicians to perform abortions whenever necessary to avoid “&nbsp;‘serious jeopardy’&nbsp;” to the mother’s <em>mental</em> health.  Stay Reply Brief in No. 23A470, p.&nbsp;6.  On that broad reading, Idaho projected that emergency rooms would function as “federal abortion enclaves governed not by state law, but by physician judgment, as enforced by the United States’s mandate to perform abortions on demand.”  <em>Ibid</em>. (citation omitted).  Idaho also warned that the Government’s interpretation would “threate[n] religious healthcare providers” by forcing doctors and hospitals to perform abortions regardless of conscience objections.  <em>Id</em>., at 15.  Both of these points were relevant to the Court’s assessment of the irreparable harm that Idaho would suffer from the preliminary injunction, <em>Nken </em>v.<em> Holder</em>, <a aria-label=\"556 U. S. 418\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/556/418\">556 U.&nbsp;S. 418</a>, 434 (2009), as well as the &nbsp;need for “immediate determination in this Court,” Supreme Court Rule 11.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> At the merits stage, however, the United States disclaimed these interpretations of EMTALA.  First, it emphatically disavowed the notion that an abortion is ever required as stabilizing treatment for mental health conditions.  Brief for United States 26, n.&nbsp;5; Tr. of Oral Arg. 76–78.  That is an important concession: If restricted to conditions posing serious jeopardy to a woman’s physical health, the Government’s reading of EMTALA does not gut Idaho’s Act.<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Barrett Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_5-1\" id=\"CONCUR_5-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a>  Second, the United States clarified that federal conscience protections, for both hospitals and individual physicians, apply in the EMTALA context.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 87–89.  That is another critical point: It alleviates Idaho’s concern that the Government’s interpretation of EMTALA would strip healthcare providers of conscience protections.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Narrowing happened from the other direction too.  The United States identified PPROM, placental abruption, pre-eclampsia, and eclampsia as conditions for which EMTALA requires an emergency abortion to be available.  (The same conditions that the Government’s witnesses identified—before Idaho’s law changed.)  But in this Court, petitioners represent that the Act permits physicians to treat each of these conditions with emergency abortions, even if the threat to the woman’s life is not imminent.  Reply Brief in No. 23–726, pp.&nbsp;21–22; Reply Brief in No. 23–727, pp.&nbsp;8–9; &nbsp;Tr. of Oral Arg. 23.  The same is true for the conditions identified by the Government’s witnesses (severe heart failure and sepsis).  Reply Brief in No. 23–727, pp.&nbsp;8–9.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> A grant of certiorari before judgment presumes that further proceedings below are unnecessary to the Court’s resolution of the question presented.  That was a miscalculation in these cases, because the parties’ positions are still evolving.  The United States has clarified that EMTALA’s reach is far more modest than it appeared when we granted certiorari and a stay.  Idaho law has materially changed since the District Court entered the preliminary injunction, and, based on the parties’ arguments before us, it seems that the framing of these cases has not had sufficient opportunity to catch up.  Cf. <em>The Monrosa </em>v.<em> Carbon Black Export, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"359 U. S. 180\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/359/180\">359 U.&nbsp;S. 180</a>, 184 (1959) (“Examination of a case on the merits, on oral argument, may bring into ‘proper focus’ a consideration which, though present in the record at the time of granting the writ, only later indicates that the grant was improvident”).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> On top of that, petitioners have raised a difficult and consequential argument, which they did not discuss in their stay applications, about whether Congress, in reliance on the Spending Clause, can obligate recipients of federal funds to violate state criminal law.  Brief for Petitioners in No. 23–726, pp.&nbsp;48–51; Reply Brief in No. 23–727, pp.&nbsp;3–4; see also Brief for Prolife Center at the University of St.&nbsp;Thomas as <em>Amicus Curiae</em>.  The District Court did not address this issue below—nor did the Ninth Circuit, which we bypassed.  We should not jump ahead of the lower courts, particularly on an issue of such importance.  <em>Cutter</em> v. <em>Wilkinson</em>, <a aria-label=\"544 U. S. 709\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/544/709\">544 U.&nbsp;S. 709</a>, 718, n.&nbsp;7 (2005) (“[W]e are a court of review, not of first view”); <em>New York </em>v.<em> Uplinger</em>, <a aria-label=\"467 U. S. 246\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/467/246\">467 U.&nbsp;S. 246</a>, 251 (1984) (Stevens, J., concurring) (dismissing as improvidently granted where “constitutional questions” would otherwise be considered “premature[ly]”).  The lower courts should address the Spending Clause issue in the first instance.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; For these reasons, a “deviation from normal appellate practice” in these cases has proved to be unwise.  Supreme Court Rule 11.  I therefore agree that we should dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted and permit proceedings to run their course in the courts below.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Having dismissed the writ, I also agree that we should vacate the stay.  As the party seeking emergency relief from this Court, Idaho bore the burden of showing that it would be “&nbsp;‘irreparably injured’&nbsp;” if the preliminary injunction remained in effect.  <em>Nken</em>, 556 U.&nbsp;S., at 434.  The Court’s grant of a stay reflected, among other things, its determination that Idaho had satisfied that burden.  Now, based on the parties’ representations, it appears that the injunction will not stop Idaho from enforcing its law in the vast majority of circumstances.  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> To be sure, the text of the two laws differs: Idaho’s Act allows abortion only when “necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman,” Idaho Code Ann. §18–622(2)(a)(i), while EMTALA requires stabilizing care to prevent “serious jeopardy” to the woman’s health, <a aria-label=\"42 USC 1395dd e 1 A i\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1395dd#e_1_A_i\">42 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §1395dd(e)(1)(A)(i)</a>.  But Idaho represents that its exception is broader than the United States fears, and the United States represents that EMTALA’s requirement is narrower than Idaho fears.  That matters in assessing Idaho’s irreparable harm for purposes of the stay.  The dramatic narrowing of the dispute—especially the Government’s position on abortions to address mental health and conscience exemptions for healthcare providers—has undercut the conclusion that Idaho would suffer irreparable harm under the preliminary injunction.  Contrary to Idaho’s concerns at the stay stage, the Government’s interpretation of EMTALA does not purport to transform emergency rooms into “federal abortion enclaves governed not by state law, but by physician judgment, as enforced by the United States’s mandate to perform abortions on demand.”  Stay Reply Brief in No. 23A470, p.&nbsp;6 (citation omitted).  Nor does it purport to deprive doctors and hospitals of conscience protections.  Cf. <em>id</em>., at 15. Thus, even with the preliminary injunction in place, Idaho’s ability to enforce its law remains almost entirely intact.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<h3 class=\"fnheader\">Notes</h3>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"CONCUR_5-1\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Barrett Concurrence at reference 1\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#CONCUR_5-1ref\">1</a> The United States also clarified that if pregnancy seriously jeopardizes the woman’s health postviability, EMTALA requires delivery, not abortion.  Brief for United States 10; Tr. of Oral Arg. 75.  And it emphasized that EMTALA requires abortion only in an “emergency acute medical situation,” where a woman’s health is in jeopardy if she does not receive an abortion “then and there.”  Tr. of Oral Arg. 79–80.  These two temporal points also narrow the scope of EMTALA’s potential conflict with Idaho’s Act.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"opinion\">&nbsp;<hr>TOP\n<h2>Opinion</h2>\n<div class=\"bodytext\">\n<p class=\"scusnameplate jy-center\">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p class=\"rule jy-center\">_________________</p>\n<p class=\"casenumber jy-center\">Nos. 23–726 and 23–727</p>\n<p class=\"rule jy-center\">_________________</p>\n<p class=\"videfirstline jy-center\">Mike Moyle, Speaker of the Idaho House of Representatives, <span class=\"smallcaps\">et&nbsp;al.</span>, PETITIONERS</p>\n<p class=\"v jy-left\">23–726 <em>v.</em></p>\n<p class=\"videsecondline jy-center\">United States</p>\n<p class=\"normal jy-both\"></p>\n<p class=\"videfirstline jy-center\">Idaho, PETITIONER</p>\n<p class=\"v jy-left\">23–727 <em>v.</em></p>\n<p class=\"videsecondline jy-center\">UNITED STATES</p>\n<h4 class=\"sylct-b sc-1 jy-center\">on writs of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</h4>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"opiniondates\">[June 26, 2024]</div>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"normal jy-both\"></p>\n<p class=\"casct-a jy-both\"><span class=\"smallcaps\"> Justice Jackson</span>, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In 1986, Congress passed the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), which requires hospitals to provide stabilizing treatment when patients present with emergency medical conditions.  See <a aria-label=\"42 USC 1395dd\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1395dd\">42 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §1395dd</a>.  Sometimes, an abortion is the only way to stabilize a patient and, therefore, comply with EMTALA.  But Idaho law prohibits abortions unless the treating physician believes that the abortion is “necessary to prevent the [patient’s] death.”  Idaho Code Ann. §18–622(2)(a)(i) (Supp. 2023).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Recognizing the clear conflict between EMTALA and Idaho law, a Federal District Judge issued an injunction that had the effect of ensuring that Idaho physicians would be able to provide the abortion care EMTALA requires.  Five months ago, this Court stayed that injunction.  As a legal matter, this Court’s stay meant that unless a doctor &nbsp;could actually say that the abortion was necessary to prevent a patient’s death, that doctor could no longer provide abortion care that she viewed as reasonably necessary to keep a patient from losing her uterus, going into organ failure, or avoiding any number of other serious health risks.  Compare §18–622(a)(i) with <a aria-label=\"42 USC 1395dd e 1 A\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1395dd#e_1_A\">42 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §1395dd(e)(1)(A)</a>.  As a practical matter, this Court’s intervention meant that Idaho physicians were forced to step back and watch as their patients suffered, or arrange for their patients to be airlifted out of Idaho.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This months-long catastrophe was completely unnecessary.  More to the point, it directly violated federal law, which in our system of government is supreme.  See Art.&nbsp;VI, cl.&nbsp;2.  As <span class=\"smallcaps\">Justice Kagan</span> explains, EMTALA plainly requires doctors to provide medically necessary stabilizing abortions in limited situations.  See <em>ante,</em> at 4–6 (concurring opinion).  To the extent that Idaho law conflicts with EMTALA, the State’s law must give way.  I join in <span class=\"smallcaps\">Justice Kagan</span>’s statutory analysis, see <em>ibid.</em>, and I concur in the Court’s <em>per curiam</em> decision to lift its stay, which should not have been entered in the first place.  I dissent in part because, in my view, the Court is wrong to dismiss these cases as improvidently granted.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">I</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> This Court typically dismisses cases as improvidently granted based on “circumstances .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. which ‘were not .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fully apprehended at the time certiorari was granted.’&nbsp;”  <em>The Monrosa</em> v. <em>Carbon Black Export, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"359 U. S. 180\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/359/180\">359 U.&nbsp;S. 180</a>, 183 (1959) (some alterations in original).  This procedural mechanism should be reserved for that end—not turned into a tool for the Court to use to avoid issues that it does not wish to decide.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The reasons that justified our grant of certiorari in these cases still hold true today.  See this Court’s Rule 11.  The importance of recognizing Congress’s judgments in &nbsp;EMTALA remains as imperative as ever.  The United States is still hamstrung in its ability to enforce federal law while States pass laws that effectively nullify EMTALA’s requirements.  And, on the ground, healthcare providers “have been all but paralyzed by legal uncertainties,” placing pregnant patients at risk while they are waiting to be transferred out of State to receive the care they need.  Brief for St. Luke’s Health System as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 14–15.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> If anything, the need for a clear answer to the Supremacy Clause question has only increased in the intervening months.  Other States across the country have enacted legislation that gives rise to the same sort of legal conflict that Idaho has created.  This pre-emption issue is not going away anytime soon and will most certainly return to this Court.  Indeed, it already has.  Just three days before we granted this petition, the Fifth Circuit decided a similar case, affirming a permanent injunction that prevents the United States from enforcing EMTALA’s requirements with respect to stabilizing emergency abortions prohibited by Texas law.  See <em>Texas </em>v.<em> Becerra</em>, 89 F.&nbsp;4th 529, 533 (2024).  The United States has already petitioned for certiorari in that case.  See Pet. for Cert. in <em>Becerra </em>v. <em>Texas</em>,<em> </em>O.&nbsp;T. 2023, No. 23–1076.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Nor has there been any change in today’s cases that might eliminate or undermine the need for this Court’s review.  The Government continues to maintain (correctly, in my view) that EMTALA’s plain text requires hospitals to provide certain emergency abortions when doing so is the only way to stabilize an emergency condition.  Brief for United States 12–20.  Idaho continues to criminalize the provision of such abortions unless doing so is necessary to prevent the patient’s death.  Idaho Code Ann. §18–622(2)(a)(i).  And both Idaho and the United States still agree that Idaho law directly criminalizes emergency care that the Federal Government reads EMTALA to require.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 16–17, 65–66.  Idaho’s lawyers may &nbsp;have changed their tune about the exact types of medical care that fall in the gap between state and federal law, but the fundamentals of this dispute remain the same.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">II</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Most importantly, as <span class=\"smallcaps\">Justice Kagan </span>observes, the conflict between the state and federal law—as they are actually being interpreted and applied on the ground—is both substantial and significant.  <em>Ante,</em> at 4–6.  It is a clash that clearly exists despite the attempt by Idaho’s counsel to muddy the waters concerning the scope of the State’s law.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The textual conflict is plain.  EMTALA requires stabilizing treatment if a patient has an acute medical condition that is so severe “that the absence of immediate medical attention could be reasonably expected to” either result in a serious health risk, or seriously threaten bodily functions or organs.  <a aria-label=\"42 USC 1395dd b 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1395dd#b_1\">42 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §§1395dd(b)(1)</a>, (e)(1)(A).  In such cases, EMTALA requires hospitals “to provide such medical treatment of the condition as may be necessary to assure, within reasonable medical probability, that no material deterioration of the condition is likely to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. occur.”  §1395dd(e)(3)(A).  Idaho’s broad criminalization of abortion—unless the treating physician believes that the abortion is “necessary to prevent the [patient’s] death,” Idaho Code Ann. §18–622(2)(a)(i)—conflicts with the text of EMTALA.  Put simply, under federal law, a hospital <em>must </em>provide an emergency abortion that is reasonably necessary to preserve a patient’s health within the meaning of EMTALA.  But, under Idaho law, a doctor cannot provide this care (required by federal law) without committing a criminal act.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> From the beginning of this litigation, the United States has emphasized the host of emergency medical conditions that require stabilizing abortions—even when the procedure is not necessarily life saving.  That list includes pre-eclampsia, preterm premature rupture of the membranes &nbsp;(PPROM), sepsis, and placental abruption, to name just a few examples.  Having now been sued over its interference with EMTALA’s protections for people experiencing these conditions, Idaho has shifted its position, both here and before the District Court, recharacterizing abortions in these scenarios as life-saving care permitted under Idaho law.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Some of my colleagues appear to view this convenient rhetorical maneuver as a material change that (also conveniently) reduces the conflict between state and federal law to the point that a ruling from this Court is no longer warranted.  See <em>ante,</em> at 6–7 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Barrett, J., </span>concurring).  But it is both legally and factually implausible to say that Idaho’s current litigating position actually mitigates the conflict between that State’s law and EMTALA.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The conflict between state and federal law still exists—in real life.  Idaho cannot credibly maintain that its law <em>always</em> permits abortions in cases of PPROM or pre-eclampsia such that its mandate <em>never</em> conflicts with federal law.  The same medical condition can present with different risks in different patients.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., Brief for Physicians for Reproductive Health as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 10–11; Brief for Physicians for Human Rights as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>11–19.  And, often, a doctor simply does not know what the risks are or whether a patient might face death.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 103–104; 2 App. 615–617.  Such a doctor, observing the different legal thresholds for action under state and federal law—not to mention the severe criminal penalties for a miscalculation—would surely be cowed into not providing abortion care that medical standards warrant and federal law requires.  Do not take my word for this; <em>it is already happening</em>.<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Jackson Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_6-1\" id=\"OPINION_6-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a>*  So it is strange, to say the least, that this Court &nbsp;would shirk its duty to resolve a pressing legal issue on the basis of representations that defy medical realities.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In any event, the representations Idaho’s counsel made during oral argument and in the State’s briefs filed in this Court are not a definitive interpretation of Idaho law.  That authority remains with the Idaho Supreme Court, which has never endorsed the State’s position.  To the contrary, the Idaho Supreme Court has emphasized that, to avoid criminal liability, a doctor must subjectively believe that an abortion is necessary to prevent death.  <em>Planned Parenthood Great Northwest</em> v. <em>State</em>, 171 Idaho 374, 445–446, 522 P. 3d 1132, 1203–1204 (2023).  And that is to say nothing of local prosecutors, who may not be aware of (or care about) Idaho’s newfound interpretation of its abortion ban, and who are highly incentivized to enforce the law to the hilt.  See Idaho Code Ann. §63–3642 (Supp. 2023) (withholding funding from local governments if their officials decline to enforce Idaho felony laws, which include these felony abortion laws); see also Brief for Idaho Coalition for Safe Healthcare, Inc., as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 14–24 (discussing myriad ways in which state and local officials in Idaho have targeted physicians).  Still, some of my colleagues latch onto the bald representations of Idaho’s counsel, using them as an escape hatch that justifies our dispensing with having to issue a merits ruling in these cases.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> We cannot simply wind back the clock to how things were before the Court injected itself into this matter.  Our intervention has already distorted this litigation process.  We permitted Idaho’s law to go into effect by staying the District Court’s injunction in the first place, then allowed this matter to sit on our merits docket for five months while we considered the question presented.  It is too little, too late for the Court to take a mulligan and just tell the lower &nbsp;courts to carry on as if none of this has happened.  As the old adage goes: The Court has made this bed so now it must lie in it—by proceeding to decide the merits of the critical pre-emption issue this case presents.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> We have granted certiorari and heard argument.  We have had ample opportunity to consider the issues.  The parties were well represented on both sides, and dozens of <em>amici</em> have weighed in.  What is more, the necessary legal reasoning is straightforward, and the answer to the question presented is—or at least should be—quite clear: Idaho law prohibits what federal law requires, so to that extent, under the Supremacy Clause, Idaho’s law is pre-empted.  See <em>Mutual Pharmaceutical Co.</em> v. <em>Bartlett</em>, <a aria-label=\"570 U. S. 472\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/570/472\">570 U.&nbsp;S. 472</a>, 479–480 (2013) (“[I]t has long been settled that state laws that conflict with federal laws are ‘without effect’&nbsp;” (quoting <em>Maryland</em> v. <em>Louisiana</em>, <a aria-label=\"451 U. S. 725\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/451/725\">451 U.&nbsp;S. 725</a>, 746 (1981))).  There is simply no good reason not to resolve this conflict now.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">*  *  *</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Despite the clarity of the legal issue and the dire need for an answer from this Court, today six Justices refuse to recognize the rights that EMTALA protects.  See <em>ante,</em> at 4–7 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Barrett,</span> J., concurring); <em>post,</em> at 4–11 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Alito,</span>&nbsp;<span class=\"smallcaps\">J.,</span> dissenting).  The majority opts, instead, to dismiss these cases.  But storm clouds loom ahead.  Three Justices suggest, at least in this context, that States have free rein to nullify federal law.  See <em>post,</em> at 11–14 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Alito,</span>&nbsp;<span class=\"smallcaps\">J.,</span> dissenting).  And three more decline to disagree with those dissenters on the merits.  See <em>ante,</em> at 4–7 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Barrett,</span>&nbsp;J., concurring).  The latter group offers only murmurs that “petitioners have raised a difficult and consequential argument” about Congress’s authority under the Spending Clause.  <em>Ante,</em> at 6 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Barrett,</span>&nbsp;<span class=\"smallcaps\">J.</span>, concurring).  So, as of today, the Court has not adopted Idaho’s farfetched theories—but it has not rejected them either.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Instead, the Court puts off the decision.  But how long &nbsp;must pregnant patients wait for an answer?  Until we confront the pending petition that the Government filed with us after the Fifth Circuit enabled Texas’s flouting of EMTALA?  Until these very cases return to us in a few years?  Will this Court just have a do-over, rehearing and rehashing the same arguments we are considering now, just at a comparatively more convenient point in time?  Or maybe we will keep punting on this issue altogether, allowing chaos to reign wherever lower courts enable States to flagrantly undercut federal law, facilitating the suffering of people in need of urgent medical treatment.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> After today, there will be a few months—maybe a few years—during which doctors may no longer need to airlift pregnant patients out of Idaho.  As <span class=\"smallcaps\">Justice Kagan</span> emphasizes, portions of Idaho’s law will be preliminarily enjoined (at least for now).  <em>Ante,</em> at 2, 4.  But having not heard from this Court on the ultimate pre-emption issue, Idaho’s doctors will still have to decide whether to provide emergency medical care in the midst of highly charged legal circumstances with no guarantee that this fragile detente over the State’s categorical prohibitions will be maintained.  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 8 (B<span class=\"smallcaps\">arrett</span>, J., concurring) (“Even with the preliminary injunction in place, Idaho’s ability to enforce its law remains almost entirely intact”).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> So, to be clear: Today’s decision is not a victory for pregnant patients in Idaho.  It is delay.  While this Court dawdles and the country waits, pregnant people experiencing emergency medical conditions remain in a precarious position, as their doctors are kept in the dark about what the law requires.  This Court had a chance to bring clarity and certainty to this tragic situation, and we have squandered it.  And for as long as we refuse to declare what the law requires, pregnant patients in Idaho, Texas, and elsewhere will be paying the price.  Because we owe them—and the Nation—an answer to the straightforward pre-emption question presented in these cases, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<h3 class=\"fnheader\">Notes</h3>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_6-1\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Jackson Opinion at reference 1\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_6-1ref\">1</a> *See Brief for Idaho Coalition for Safe Healthcare, Inc., as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 7–13 (providing examples in Idaho where doctors’ lack of certainty prevented them from providing medically necessary abortions); see also Brief for St. Luke’s Health System as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 14–16 (same); Brief for Amanda Zurawski et&nbsp;al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 29–30 (same); Brief for Physicians for Human Rights as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 12–17 (same).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"dissent\">&nbsp;<hr>TOP\n<h2>Dissent</h2>\n<div class=\"bodytext\">\n<p class=\"scusnameplate jy-center\">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p class=\"rule jy-center\">_________________</p>\n<p class=\"casenumber jy-center\">Nos. 23–726 and 23–727</p>\n<p class=\"rule jy-center\">_________________</p>\n<p class=\"videfirstline jy-center\">Mike Moyle, Speaker of the Idaho House of Representatives, <span class=\"smallcaps\">et&nbsp;al.</span>, PETITIONERS</p>\n<p class=\"v jy-left\">23–726 <em>v.</em></p>\n<p class=\"videsecondline jy-center\">United States</p>\n<p class=\"normal jy-both\"></p>\n<p class=\"videfirstline jy-center\">Idaho, PETITIONER</p>\n<p class=\"v jy-left\">23–727 <em>v.</em></p>\n<p class=\"videsecondline jy-center\">UNITED STATES</p>\n<h4 class=\"sylct-b sc-1 jy-center\">on writs of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</h4>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"opiniondates\">[June 26, 2024]</div>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"normal jy-both\"></p>\n<p class=\"casct-a jy-both\"><span class=\"smallcaps\"> Justice Alito</span>, with whom <span class=\"smallcaps\">Justice Thomas</span> joins, and with whom <span class=\"smallcaps\">Justice Gorsuch</span> joins as to Parts I and II, dissenting.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This case presents an important and unsettled question of federal statutory law: whether the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), <a aria-label=\"42 USC 1395dd\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1395dd\">42 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §1395dd</a>, sometimes demands that hospitals perform abortions and thereby preempts Idaho’s recently adopted Defense of Life Act, Idaho Code Ann. §18–622 (Supp. 2023).  Enacted nearly 40 years ago, EMTALA requires hospitals participating in Medicare to “scree[n]” and “stabilize” “any individual” who comes to an emergency room with an “emergency medical condition” that jeopardizes the patient’s “health.”  §§1395dd(a), (b)(1)(A), (e)(1)(A).  And if the patient is a pregnant woman, the hospital must stabilize both “the woman” and “her unborn child.”  §1395dd(e)(1)(A)(i).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> After this Court’s decision in <em>Dobbs </em>v.<em> Jackson Women’s Health Organization</em>, <a aria-label=\"597 U.S. 215\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/597/215\">597 U.&nbsp;S. 215 (2022)</a>, Idaho and other &nbsp;States enacted new laws restricting the performance of abortions.  To protect both “maternal health and safety” and “&nbsp;‘the life of preborn children,’&nbsp;” <em>Planned Parenthood Great Northwest</em> v. <em>State</em>, 171 Idaho 374, 438, 522 P.&nbsp;3d 1132, 1196 (2023) (quoting Idaho Code Ann. §18–601), Idaho’s law permits an abortion only when  “necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman,” §18–622(2)(a)(i).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Shortly before Idaho’s law took effect, President Biden instructed members of his administration to find ways to limit <em>Dobbs</em>’s reach.  Protecting Access to Reproductive Healthcare Services, Exec. Order No. 14076, <a aria-label=\"87 FR 42053\" href=\"/rio/citation/87_FR_42053\">87 Fed. Reg. 42053</a> (2022).  In response, Government lawyers hit upon the novel argument that, under EMTALA, all Medicare-funded hospitals—that is, the vast majority of hospitals<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-1\" id=\"DISSENT_7-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a>—<em>must</em> perform abortions on request when the “health” of a pregnant woman is in serious jeopardy.  §1395dd(e)(1)(A)(i). In the Government’s view, EMTALA trumps laws like Idaho’s, which allow abortions only to preserve the life of the pregnant woman.  See Dept. of Health &amp; Human Servs. (HHS), Reinforcement of EMTALA Obligations Specific to Patients Who Are Pregnant or Are Experiencing Pregnancy Loss 1 (QSO–22–22–Hospitals, July 11, 2022).  The Government sued Idaho on this preemption theory and obtained a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the state law “to the extent it conflicts with EMTALA.”  623 F.&nbsp;Supp. 3d 1097, 1117 (Idaho 2022).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Government’s preemption theory is plainly unsound.  Far from requiring hospitals to perform abortions, EMTALA’s text unambiguously demands that Medicare-funded hospitals protect the health of both a pregnant woman <em>and </em>her “unborn child.”  §1395dd(e)(1)(A)(i).  And &nbsp;even if there were some ambiguity in the statutory text, we would be obligated to resolve that ambiguity in favor of the State because EMTALA was enacted under the Spending Clause, and as we have held time and again, conditions attached to the receipt of federal funds must be unambiguous.  <em>Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed.</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, <a aria-label=\"548 U. S. 291\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/548/291\">548 U.&nbsp;S. 291</a>, 296 (2006); <em>Pennhurst State School and Hospital</em> v. <em>Halderman</em>, <a aria-label=\"451 U. S. 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/451/1\">451 U.&nbsp;S. 1</a>, 17 (1981).  Here, no one who has any respect for statutory language can plausibly say that the Government’s interpretation is unambiguously correct.  And in any event, Idaho never consented to <em>any</em> conditions imposed by EMTALA and certainly did not surrender control of the practice of medicine and the regulation of abortions within its territory.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Recognizing the flaws in the Government’s theory and Idaho’s “strong” likelihood of success, this Court stayed the preliminary injunction pending appeal on January 5.  And, wisely or not, the Court also took the unusual step of granting certiorari before Idaho’s appeal was heard by the Ninth Circuit.  See this Court’s Rule 11.  Now the Court dismisses the writ and, what is worse, vacates the stay.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This about-face is baffling.  Nothing legally relevant has occurred since January 5.  And the underlying issue in this case—whether EMTALA requires hospitals to perform abortions in some circumstances—is a straightforward question of statutory interpretation.  It is squarely presented by the decision below, and it has been exhaustively briefed and argued.  In addition to the parties’ briefs, we received 46 <em>amicus</em> briefs, including briefs submitted by 44 States and the District of Columbia; briefs expressing the views of 379 Members of Congress; and briefs from prominent medical organizations.  Altogether, we have more than 1,300 pages of briefing to assist us, and we heard nearly two hours of argument.  Everything there is to say about the statutory interpretation question has probably been said many times over.  That question is as ripe for decision as it &nbsp;ever will be.  Apparently, the Court has simply lost the will to decide the easy but emotional and highly politicized question that the case presents.  That is regrettable.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Having already taken the extraordinary step of granting certiorari before judgment in order to decide whether the Government’s new interpretation of EMTALA is correct, we have no good reason to change course now.  This is especially so because the Court’s decision to reexamine the stay issued in January makes it necessary to reassess whether Idaho showed a likelihood of success on the merits, a question that is closely related to the question whether Idaho or the Government has correctly interpreted EMTALA.  I will therefore proceed to analyze what EMTALA means.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">I</h3>\n<h4 class=\"jy-center\">A</h4>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The text of EMTALA shows clearly that it does not require hospitals to perform abortions in violation of Idaho law.  To the contrary, EMTALA obligates Medicare-funded hospitals to <em>treat</em>, not abort, an “unborn child.”</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> EMTALA imposes two main obligations on covered hospitals.  First, a hospital must, within its “capabilit[ies],” “screen” “any individual” arriving at the emergency room without regard to the individual’s ability to pay.  §§1395dd(a), (h).  The purpose of this screening is to determine whether the individual has an “emergency medical condition,” which EMTALA defines as follows:</p>\n<p class=\"bqbegin jy-both\"> “a medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in—</p>\n<p class=\"bqpara jy-both\"> “(i) placing the health of the individual (or, with respect to a pregnant woman, the health of the woman <em>or her unborn child)</em> in serious jeopardy,</p>\n<p class=\"bqpara jy-both\"> “(ii) serious impairment to bodily functions, or</p>\n<p class=\"bqend jy-both\"> “(iii) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or &nbsp;part.”&nbsp;&nbsp;§1395dd(e)(1)(A) (emphasis added).<a aria-label=\"reference 2 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-2\" id=\"DISSENT_7-2ref\"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> When a hospital determines that an “emergency medical condition” exists, it has two options.  It may provide “treatment” within the capability of its “staff and facilities.”  §1395dd(b)(1)(A). Or it may “transfer .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the individual” to another hospital that “has available space and qualified personnel for the treatment” as long as the transfer would effect a net benefit for the patient.  §§1395dd(b)(1)(B), (c)(2)(B)(i).  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> At no point in its elaboration of the screening, stabilization, and transfer requirements does EMTALA mention abortion.  Just the opposite is true: EMTALA requires the hospital at every stage to protect an “unborn child” from harm.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Begin with the screening provision, which requires a hospital “to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition (within the meaning of subsection (e)(1)) exists.”  §1395dd(a).  “[W]ith respect to a pregnant woman,” subsection (e)(1) defines an emergency medical condition as one that is sufficiently serious to “plac[e] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the health of the woman <em>or her unborn child</em> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in serious jeopardy.”  §1395dd(e)(1)(A)(i) (emphasis added).  Thus, if the hospital identifies an emergency medical condition threatening the child, it must “stabilize” that condition to ensure that the child’s health does not remain in “jeopardy.”  §§1395dd(b)(1)(A), (e)(1)(A)(i).  It goes without saying that aborting an “unborn child” does not protect it from jeopardy.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Similarly, if a hospital wants to transfer a pregnant woman to another facility, it may not do so unless, among other things, a physician certifies directly or through an intermediary that the medical benefits of transfer outweigh &nbsp;any “increased risks” to the woman “and, in the case of labor, to the unborn child.”  §§1395dd(c)(1)(A)(ii), (e)(1)(B).  Thus, regardless of whether a hospital chooses to treat or transfer a pregnant woman, it must strive to protect her “unborn child” from harm.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Government struggles mightily—but unsuccessfully—to get around this language.  First, the Government argues that EMTALA’s repeated use of the term “individual,” coupled with the Dictionary Act’s definition of that term, which does not include an “unborn child,”<a aria-label=\"reference 3 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-3\" id=\"DISSENT_7-3ref\"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></a> shows that “[a]ll of EMTALA’s duties—screening, stabilization, and transfer—run to the ‘individual’  seeking care.”  Brief for United States 41.  That assertion falls flat in light of EMTALA’s express protection of the unborn child.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Besides, there is a simple explanation for EMTALA’s repeated use of the term “individual,” and it provides no support for the Government’s interpretation.  Most of those references involve conduct in which only the pregnant woman can engage, such as going to an emergency room,<a aria-label=\"reference 4 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-4\" id=\"DISSENT_7-4ref\"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup></a> receiving medical information,<a aria-label=\"reference 5 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-5\" id=\"DISSENT_7-5ref\"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup></a> consenting to or refusing treatment,<a aria-label=\"reference 6 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-6\" id=\"DISSENT_7-6ref\"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup></a> or filing suit.<a aria-label=\"reference 7 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-7\" id=\"DISSENT_7-7ref\"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup></a>  Many references concern transfer to another facility,<a aria-label=\"reference 8 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-8\" id=\"DISSENT_7-8ref\"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup></a> and when a pregnant woman is transferred, her “unborn child” obviously goes with her.  Another reference concerns a woman’s “emergency medical condition,” which, as noted, includes conditions that jeopardize her “unborn &nbsp;child.”<a aria-label=\"reference 9 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-9\" id=\"DISSENT_7-9ref\"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup></a>  And some references expressly mention both the “individual” and “the unborn child.”<a aria-label=\"reference 10 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-10\" id=\"DISSENT_7-10ref\"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup></a>  No use of the term “individual” supports the Government’s interpretation.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Second, based on a provision stating that an individual may not be treated without consent, §1395dd(b)(2), the Government infers that “it is for the pregnant woman, not state law, to decide how to proceed” when her health is at risk.  Brief for United States 43.  The Government’s logic is faulty.  The right to withhold consent does not necessarily carry with it the right to demand whatever cannot be done without consent.  <em>X</em> may withhold consent to a contract with <em>Y</em>, but that does not mean that <em>X</em> may demand to enter into such a contract.  A person may not be forced to assume the duties of the Presidency without consent, but it does not follow that this person may demand to be sworn in as President.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Or, to provide an example that is more closely related to the matter at hand, the right to refuse medical treatment without consent does not entail the right to demand treatment that is prohibited by law.  Cancer patients have the right to refuse treatment that their doctors recommend, but they do not have a right to obtain whatever treatment they want, such as the administration of a drug that cannot legally be used in this country.  Cf. <a aria-label=\"21 USC 360bbb 0a\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/360bbb–0\">21 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §360bbb–0a</a> (granting terminal patients the right to try experimental drugs).  Likewise here, a woman’s right to withhold consent to treatment related to her pregnancy does not mean that she can demand an abortion.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> For these reasons, the text of EMTALA conclusively shows that it does not require hospitals to perform abortions.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">&nbsp;B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> For those who find it appropriate to look beyond the statutory text, the context in which EMTALA was enacted reinforces what the text makes clear.  Congress designed EMTALA to solve a particular problem—preventing private hospitals from turning away patients who are unable to pay for medical care.  H.&nbsp;R. Rep. No. 99–241(I), pt. 1, p. 27 (1985); K. Treiger, Preventing Patient Dumping: Sharpening the COBRA’s Fangs, 61 N.&nbsp;Y. U. L. Rev. 1186, 1188 (1986).  And none of many briefs submitted in this suit has found any suggestion in the proceedings leading up to EMTALA’s passage that the Act might also use the carrot of federal funds to entice hospitals to perform abortions.  To the contrary, EMTALA garnered broad support in both Houses of Congress, including the support of Members such as Representative Henry Hyde who adamantly opposed the use of federal funds to abet abortion.<a aria-label=\"reference 11 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-11\" id=\"DISSENT_7-11ref\"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> It is also telling that the Congress that initially enacted EMTALA in 1986 and the one that amended it in 1989 also passed appropriations riders under what is now known as the Hyde Amendment (named after Representative Hyde) to prevent federal funds from facilitating abortions, except in limited circumstances.  See <em>Harris</em> v. <em>McRae</em>, <a aria-label=\"448 U. S. 297\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/448/297\">448 U.&nbsp;S. 297</a>, 302 (1980).  Between 1981 and 1993—the very period when EMTALA was enacted and amended—the Hyde Amendment contained only one exception: for abortions necessary to save the life of the pregnant woman.  Congressional Research Service, E. Liu &amp; W. Shen, The Hyde Amendment: An Overview 1 (2022); see §204, <a href=\"/rio/citation/99_Stat._1119\">99 Stat. 1119</a> (1986 Hyde Amendment).  The Hyde Amendment thus prohibited federal funds from paying for the health-related &nbsp;abortions that the Government says EMTALA mandates.  It would have been strange indeed if a Congress that repeatedly sought to prevent federal funding of abortions simultaneously enacted a law that, as interpreted by the Government, requires hospitals and physicians to perform that very same procedure.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Government’s reading of EMTALA is doubly strange given that the President who signed that law repeatedly promised not to use federal funds to subsidize or require the provision of abortions.  Less than three months before signing EMTALA, President Reagan told participants in the annual March for Life that “the resources of government are not [to be] used to promote or perform abortions.”  The American Presidency Project, Remarks to Participants in the March for Life Rally (Jan. 22, 1986).  The next year, he touted his administration’s work “to restrict the use of Federal funds to perform abortions.”  <em>Id</em>., Remarks to Participants in the March for Life Rally (Jan. 22, 1987).  In another 1987 speech, he promised that his administration would “oppose any legislation that would require individuals or institutions, public or private, to finance or perform abortions.”  <em>Id</em>., Remarks at a White House Briefing for Right to Life Activists (July 30, 1987).  And his 1986 and 1987 messages to Congress repeated that promise.  See <em>id</em>., Message to the Congress on “A Quest for Excellence” (Jan. 27, 1987); <em>id</em>., Message to the Congress on America’s Agenda for the Future (Feb. 6, 1986).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Around the same time, President Reagan’s HHS Secretary testified before Congress that “the Administration steadfastly opposes [the] creation of [a] program which would encourage, promote or finance the performance of abortions.”  Statement of the Hon. Margaret M. Heckler, in Budget Reconciliation: Hearings before the Senate Committee on Finance, 99th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, p.&nbsp;273 (1985).  It beggars belief that President Reagan would have happily &nbsp;signed EMTALA into law if it did what he “steadfastly oppose[d].”  <em>Ibid. </em></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">C</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Desperate to find some crumb of support for its interpretation, the Government scrapes together a handful of sources that it says evidence a general understanding that EMTALA requires hospitals to perform health-related abortions prohibited by Idaho law.  None of these sources stands for that proposition.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> First, the Government searched a vast database of HHS enforcement decisions and located six occurring between 2010 and 2023 that it finds helpful.  It is not obvious why those enforcement decisions—which postdate EMTALA by more than 20 years—shed light on its original meaning.  And it is even less clear why they justify the Government’s claim that EMTALA preempts Idaho law.  Five of the six cases involved ectopic pregnancies, which the Idaho law does not cover.  See Idaho Code Ann. §18–604(1)(c) (excluding ectopic pregnancies from the definition of “abortion”).  In the remaining case, the hospital was faulted, not for failing to perform an abortion, but for discharging a sick pregnant woman without calling for an ambulance to transport her to another hospital.<a aria-label=\"reference 12 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-12\" id=\"DISSENT_7-12ref\"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Government also seizes upon a provision in the Affordable Care Act stating that “[n]othing in this Act shall be construed to relieve any health care provider from providing emergency services as required by State or Fed&nbsp;eral law, including .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. EMTALA.” <a aria-label=\"42 USC 18023 d\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/18023#d\">42 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §18023(d)</a> (internal quotation marks omitted).  Because this provision was placed in a section of the Act concerning abortion, the Government infers that it reflects a congressional understanding that EMTALA sometimes requires abortions.  Brief for United States 19–20.  That inference is totally unwarranted.  The provision in question refers to the entire massive Affordable Care Act, not just the relatively few provisions concerning abortion.  Compare §18023(d), with §18023(c) (referring more narrowly to “this subsection”).  It reaffirms the duty of participating hospitals to comply with EMTALA, but it does not expand what the text of EMTALA requires.<a aria-label=\"reference 13 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-13\" id=\"DISSENT_7-13ref\"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup></a>  So this provision cannot support the Government’s interpretation of EMTALA either.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">II</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> As the previous Part shows, EMTALA’s text and context decisively refute the Government’s interpretation.  But there is a third strike against the Government’s position: EMTALA is an exercise of Congress’s spending power.  And when Congress relies on its authority to attach conditions to the receipt of federal funds, special rules apply.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Spending Clause legislation operates “much in the nature of a contract: in return for federal funds, the [recipients] agree to comply with federally imposed conditions.”  <em>Pennhurst</em>,<em> </em>451 U.&nbsp;S., at 17.  These conditions do not bind unless and until they are accepted, and private parties “can opt out of spending programs” at will, “completely nullifying whatever force the spending conditions once had.”  <em>Health and Hospital Corporation of Marion Cty. </em>v. <em>Talevski</em>, <a aria-label=\"599 U.

And recipients must be given a “legitimate choice whether to accept the federal conditions.”  <em>National Federation of Independent Business </em>v.<em> Sebelius</em>, <a aria-label=\"567 U. S. 519\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/567/519\">567 U.&nbsp;S. 519</a>, 578 (2012) (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Roberts</span>, C.&nbsp;J.); accord, <em>Steward Machine Co.</em> v. <em>Davis</em>, <a aria-label=\"301 U. S. 548\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/301/548\">301 U.&nbsp;S. 548</a>, 590 (1937).  The Government’s interpretation founders at both points.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> First, consider the requirement that EMTALA speak unambiguously.  Even if it were possible to read EMTALA as requiring abortions prohibited by Idaho law, it is beyond dispute that such a requirement is not unambiguously clear.  The statute does not mention abortion, let alone expressly bind hospitals to perform abortions contrary to state law.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The need for clear statutory language is especially important in this suit because the Government’s interpretation would intrude on an area traditionally left to state control, namely, the practice of medicine.  We typically expect Congress to “&nbsp;‘make its intention “clear and manifest” if it intends to pre-empt the historic powers of the States.’&nbsp;”  <em>Gregory</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, <a aria-label=\"501 U. S. 452\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/501/452\">501 U.&nbsp;S. 452</a>, 461 (1991) (quoting <em>Rice</em> v. <em>Santa Fe Elevator Corp.</em>, <a aria-label=\"331 U. S. 218\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/331/218\">331 U.&nbsp;S. 218</a>, 230 (1947)); see also <em>Gonzales</em> v. <em>Oregon</em>, <a aria-label=\"546 U. S. 243\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/546/243\">546 U.&nbsp;S. 243</a>, 274 (2006) (“[T]he background principles of our federal system also belie the notion that Congress would use such an obscure grant of &nbsp;authority to regulate areas traditionally supervised by the States’ police power”).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Second, consider the requirement that parties be given a choice before being bound by Spending Clause conditions.  The Government’s interpretation purports to limit Idaho’s choices about what conduct to criminalize.  But Idaho never “agree[d]” to be bound by EMTALA,<a aria-label=\"reference 14 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-14\" id=\"DISSENT_7-14ref\"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup></a> <em>Cummings</em>, 596 U.&nbsp;S., at 219, let alone to surrender its historic power to regulate the practice of medicine or the performance of abortions within its borders.  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Idaho Legislature takes its argument against preemption even further.  It contends that EMTALA cannot preempt the State’s abortion regulations because Idaho is not a party to the agreement between the Federal Government and the hospitals that take Medicare funds.  See Brief for Petitioners in No. 23–726, pp. 50–51.  As it explains, States cannot be bound by terms that they never accepted, so it is hard to see how a third party’s agreement with the Federal Government can deprive a State of the ability to enforce its criminal laws.  Accord, <em>Talevski</em>, 599 U.&nbsp;S., at 212 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas</span>, J., dissenting) (“[E]ven those who held the broadest conception of the spending power recognized that it was only a power to spend, not a power to impose binding requirements with the force of federal law”).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The potential implications of permitting preemption here are far-reaching.  Under the Government’s view, Congress could apparently pay doctors to perform not only emergency abortions but also third-trimester elective abortions or eugenic abortions.  It could condition Medicare funds on hospitals’ offering assisted suicide even in the vast majority of States that ban the practice.  It could authorize the practice of medicine by any doctor who accepts Medicare payments &nbsp;even if he or she does not meet the State’s licensing requirements.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> While the Government is not troubled by the potential consequences of its preemption argument, Congress was sensitive to state prerogatives.  The Medicare Act, in which EMTALA is situated, disclaims any construction that would “authorize any Federal officer or employee to exercise any supervision or control over the practice of medicine or the manner in which medical services are provided” in a particular State.  <a aria-label=\"42 USC 1395\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1395\">42 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §1395</a>.  This disclaimer evidences a desire to “minimize federal intrusion” into state healthcare regulation.  <em>Massachusetts Medical Soc. </em>v.<em> Dukakis</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/815_F.2d_790\">815 F.&nbsp;2d 790</a>, 791 (CA1 1987) (opinion of Breyer, J.).  EMTALA’s narrow preemption clause also respects core state powers by providing that the Act “do[es] not preempt any State or local law requirement, except to the extent that the requirement directly conflicts with a requirement of this section.”  §1395dd(f&nbsp;).  This phrasing signals that EMTALA’s default position is coexistence with state law.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In response to the Legislature’s argument, the Government claims that a handful of our cases have held that Spending Clause statutes can preempt the laws of non-consenting States, but those cases do not begin to settle the question at hand.  Two are entirely inapposite.<a aria-label=\"reference 15 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-15\" id=\"DISSENT_7-15ref\"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup></a>  And the remaining cases simply upheld the Federal Government’s ability to prevent the use of federal money for purposes &nbsp;other than those intended by Congress.<a aria-label=\"reference 16 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-16\" id=\"DISSENT_7-16ref\"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup></a>  The Government has not identified any decision holding that a federal law enacted under the Spending Clause preempts a state criminal law or public health regulation.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> For present purposes, it is not necessary to decide whether the Legislature’s theory is correct.  At a minimum, however, it provides yet another reason to be wary about interpreting EMTALA to displace the core powers of a non-consenting State without unmistakable clarity regarding the meaning of the federal law.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">*  *  *</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> In sum, the Government’s new interpretation of EMTALA is refuted by the statutory text, the context in which the law was enacted, and the rules of interpretation that we apply to Spending Clause legislation.  We should reject the Government’s interpretation and put that matter to rest.<a aria-label=\"reference 17 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-17\" id=\"DISSENT_7-17ref\"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">&nbsp;III</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Even if the Court is unwilling to decide the statutory interpretation question, there is no excuse for vacating the stay of the preliminary injunction.  In order to obtain that injunction, the Government was required to make a strong showing that it was likely to prevail on the merits.  See <em>Munaf </em>v.<em> Geren</em>, <a aria-label=\"553 U. S. 674\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/553/674\">553 U.&nbsp;S. 674</a>, 690 (2008).  And as I have explained, its argument was almost certain to lose.  That in itself is sufficient to preclude continuation of the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Why then have six Justices voted to vacate the stay?  The <em>per curiam</em> itself provides no explanation.  In separate opinions, three of the six agree with the Government’s interpretation of EMTALA, see <em>supra</em>, at 15, n.&nbsp;17, and that at least is an explanation that would make sense if the premise (the correctness of the Government’s interpretation) were sound.  As for the remaining three, their only explanation is that “the injunction will not stop Idaho from enforcing its law in the vast majority of circumstances” and that therefore Idaho cannot show that it will be irreparably harmed by allowing the injunction to remain in place during the pendency of the appeal.  <em>Ante</em>, at 7 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Barrett</span>, J., joined by <span class=\"smallcaps\">Roberts, C.&nbsp;J.,</span> and <span class=\"smallcaps\">Kavanaugh</span>, J., concurring).  That justification is patently unsound.  “&nbsp;‘[A]ny time a State is enjoined by a court from effectuating statutes enacted by representatives of its people, it suffers a form of irreparable injury.’&nbsp;” <em>Maryland</em> v. <em>King</em>, <a aria-label=\"567 U. S. 1301\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/567/1301\">567 U.&nbsp;S. 1301</a>, 1303 (2012) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Roberts</span>, C.&nbsp;J., in chambers).  And in this case, Idaho’s injury is not abstract.  As I will explain, it is very likely that &nbsp;the preliminary injunction will lead to more abortions, including in at least some cases where the fetus is viable.  The State of Idaho wants to prevent that; the preliminary injunction stands in its way.  Isn’t that enough to constitute irreparable harm? </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Justices who have joined <span class=\"smallcaps\">Justice Barrett</span>’s concurrence claim that the parties’ briefs and oral arguments seem to have narrowed the degree to which EMTALA, as interpreted by the Government, conflicts with the Idaho law, <em>ante,</em> at 7–8, but all the parties continue to insist that the laws conflict.  The Solicitor General argued that EMTALA’s focus on a pregnant woman’s health is broader than Idaho’s life-of-the-mother exception.  In forceful terms, she told us: “In Idaho, doctors have to shut their eyes to everything except death,” whereas under EMTALA, a physician is supposed to think about serious threats to a pregnant woman’s health.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 102.  In light of this perceived conflict, the Solicitor General said it was “gravely mistaken” to suggest that “there really isn’t in operation a difference between” EMTALA and Idaho law.  <em>Id</em>., at 101–102.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Idaho agreed that the Government’s interpretation of EMTALA conflicts with state law.  In particular, the State worried that “the United States’ novel theory” would “authorize emergency-room doctors to perform abortions” for mental-health reasons and would thus “turn emergency rooms into federal abortion enclaves governed not by state law but by subjective physician judgment.”  Brief for Petitioner in No. 23–727, p. 30; see also Tr. of Oral Arg.  45–46.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Thus, whatever narrowing may have occurred during briefing and argument in this Court, both the Government and the State of Idaho fervently maintain that it matters whether the Idaho law is enforced.  Do any Justices in the majority seriously disagree?  Do any of them think that the parties, not to mention their armies of <em>amici</em>, are fighting about nothing?</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; Three of the six Justices in the majority also agree that there is a conflict—and judging from their fiery rhetoric, a big one.  See <em>ante,</em> at 1 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Kagan</span>, J., joined by <span class=\"smallcaps\">Sotomayor, J., </span>and by <span class=\"smallcaps\">Jackson, </span>J., as to Part II, concurring); <em>ante,</em> at 7 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Jackson</span>, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  And they are correct to this extent: there is a real conflict.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">A</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> I begin with the Government’s argument that “there are numerous conditions” that may afflict a pregnant woman “where a doctor’s immediate concern is not death.”  Tr. of Oral Arg. 103.  In those cases, the Government explains, a doctor might be worried about serious risks to the woman’s “health.”  <em>Ibid.</em>  In the Government’s telling, EMTALA requires hospitals to perform an abortion on demand in these circumstances.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Idaho law says otherwise.  An Idaho doctor may not perform an abortion unless the doctor “determine[s], in his good faith medical judgment .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;, that the abortion [is] necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.”  Idaho Code Ann. §18–622(2)(a)(i).  And even then, the doctor must “attemp[t] to perform the abortion in the manner that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. provide[s] the best opportunity for the unborn child to survive,” unless doing so “would .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. pos[e] a greater risk of the death of the pregnant woman.”  §622(2)(a)(ii).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> These standards do not require a doctor to be “objective[ly] certai[n]” that the abortion is “&nbsp;‘necessary’ to save the woman’s life.” <em>Planned Parenthood</em>, 171 Idaho, at 445, 522 P.&nbsp;3d, at 1203 (emphasis deleted).  Nor does Idaho law require that the risk of death be particularly immediate.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Indeed, the Idaho Supreme Court has explained that the law “leaves wide room for the physician’s ‘good faith medical judgment’ on whether [an] abortion was ‘necessary.’&nbsp;”  <em>Ibid</em>.; accord, <em>id</em>., at 446, 522 P.&nbsp;3d, at 1203 (noting that the Act “imposes a subjective standard based on the individual physician’s good faith medical judgment”).  And &nbsp;any latitude, it said, “&nbsp;‘operates for the benefit, not the disadvantage, of the pregnant woman.’&nbsp;”  <em>Id</em>., at 445–446, 522 P.&nbsp;3d, at 1203–1204.  Even so, Idaho’s law is focused on “death,” and a doctor must be able to say in “good faith” that he or she was acting to preserve the woman’s life, not simply her health.  Idaho Code Ann. §18–622(2)(a)(i).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> These different considerations—health versus life—may lead to different outcomes.  For instance, consider the situation of a woman who experiences a condition that was discussed in the briefs and at argument: preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM), which occurs when a woman’s amniotic sac breaks before the 37th week of pregnancy.  1 App. 295.  The Members of this Court are not physicians and should therefore be wary about expressing conclusions about medical issues.  But guidance provided by prominent medical institutions is sufficient to show how Idaho law and EMTALA, as interpreted by the Government, may conflict in such cases.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> If a woman experiences PPROM between the 34th and 37th week of pregnancy and does not go into labor, her physician is likely to recommend that labor be induced.<a aria-label=\"reference 18 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-18\" id=\"DISSENT_7-18ref\"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup></a>  In that situation, it does not appear that the risk of conflict is high.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> On the other hand, when PPROM occurs earlier than that, the chances of conflict are greatly increased.  If PPROM occurs before the 34th week and the woman’s pregnancy continues, she may experience conditions such as an infection of the amniotic fluid, inflammation of the uterine lining, hemorrhage, or sepsis.<a aria-label=\"reference 19 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-19\" id=\"DISSENT_7-19ref\"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup></a>  However, life-threatening &nbsp;complications are not inevitable, and according to the PPROM Foundation, death is “extremely rare.”<a aria-label=\"reference 20 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-20\" id=\"DISSENT_7-20ref\"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup></a>  A physician may try to delay labor by putting the woman on bed rest and administering steroids to help the baby’s lungs grow and antibiotics to prevent infection.<a aria-label=\"reference 21 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-21\" id=\"DISSENT_7-21ref\"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> When PPROM occurs before the 24th week of pregnancy, the potential for conflict appears to be even higher.  But in that situation, it may still be possible to manage the situation until the baby can be delivered,<a aria-label=\"reference 22 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-22\" id=\"DISSENT_7-22ref\"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup></a> and there is a chance of a good outcome for both the mother and child, although studies have yielded different results.<a aria-label=\"reference 23 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-23\" id=\"DISSENT_7-23ref\"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup></a>  Thus, when &nbsp;PPROM occurs before the 34th  week of pregnancy, there is a risk to the health of both the woman and her unborn child.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In these situations, the Defense of Life Act requires doctors to consider whether performing an abortion is necessary to prevent the woman’s death.  Because this is a “subjective” standard, <em>Planned Parenthood</em>, 171 Idaho, at 446, 522 P.&nbsp;3d, at 1204, different doctors may reach different conclusions about when PPROM endangers the woman’s life.  At least some may conclude in some cases of PPROM occurring before the 34th week of pregnancy that the woman’s life is not endangered since she may never develop a serious infection, let alone life-threatening sepsis or any other potentially fatal condition, if she receives proper treatment.  See 1 App. 306–307.  Rather, those doctors may believe that Idaho law requires them to try to delay delivery long enough to save the child’s life, unless PPROM becomes sufficiently “severe” to cause “infection and serious risk of sepsis.”  See, <em>e.g</em>., 2 <em>id</em>., at 547. <a aria-label=\"reference 24 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-24\" id=\"DISSENT_7-24ref\"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> According to the Government’s experts, however, EMTALA requires a hospital to perform an abortion at the woman’s request whenever PPROM is diagnosed, even if the woman has not yet developed an infection or any other health complications.  That is because, they assert, it can &nbsp;be “reasonably expected” that, in “the absence of immediate medical attention,” PPROM would “plac[e] the health” of the pregnant woman “in serious jeopardy” or cause “serious dysfunction” to her reproductive organs.  §§1395dd(c)(1)(A)(ii), (e)(1)(A)(i) and (iii); see, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., 2 App. 594 (“Providing stabilizing treatment in the form of termination of pregnancy at the point of diagnosis would be an appropriate means to preserve the patient’s reproductive organs at that time”).  Thus, in PPROM cases, there may be an important conflict between what Idaho law permits and what EMTALA, as interpreted by the Government, demands.  And the same may be true with respect to other conditions that a pregnant woman may experience.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This gap between the Idaho law and the Government’s interpretation of EMTALA matters.  Idaho has always permitted abortions that are necessary to preserve the life of a pregnant woman, but it has not allowed abortions for other non-life-threatening medical conditions.  <em>Planned Parenthood</em>, 171 Idaho, at 391–394, 522 P.&nbsp;3d, at 1149–1152 (summarizing Idaho’s historical restrictions); see also <em>Dobbs</em>, 597 U.&nbsp;S., at 302–330 (compiling other state statutes with identical exceptions).  This balance reflects Idaho’s judgment about a difficult and important moral question.  See <em>Planned Parenthood</em>, 171 Idaho, at 437–438, 522 P.&nbsp;3d, at 1195–1196.  By requiring Idaho hospitals to strike a different balance, the preliminary injunction thwarts the will of the people of Idaho as expressed in law by their elected representatives.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> I now turn to Idaho’s claim that the Government’s reading of EMTALA would authorize abortions for mental-health reasons.  My colleagues dismiss this concern because at argument, the Solicitor General “emphatically disavowed the notion that an abortion is ever required as stabilizing treatment for mental health conditions.”  <em>Ante</em>, at 5 &nbsp;(<span class=\"smallcaps\">Barrett</span>, J., concurring).  But it is hard to see how the Government could reach that conclusion.  At oral argument, the Solicitor General conceded that the term “health” in EMTALA includes mental health, Tr. of Oral Arg. 77–78, and if that is so, it is not difficult to imagine a situation in which the Government’s interpretation of EMTALA could require an abortion. </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Suppose, for example, that a woman in the 10th week of gestation experiences serious depression due to her pregnancy.  If she asks emergency medical professionals for treatment, her medical care providers might conclude that her continued pregnancy could “reasonably be expected” to seriously jeopardize the woman’s mental health.  §1395dd(e)(1)(A).  Under the Government’s reading of EMTALA, the woman would then have the right to “make an informed decision” about the treatment she received.  Brief for United States 41.  If the woman preferred to abort rather than manage her depression alongside her pregnancy, it is not apparent why the Government’s reading of EMTALA would not require that abortion.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> We have seen where a rule permitting abortions to protect the psychological health of pregnant women may lead.  In <em>Roe</em>, the Court held that a woman had the right to obtain a post-viability abortion that was deemed “necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.”  <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Wade</em>, <a aria-label=\"410 U. S. 113\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/410/113\">410 U.&nbsp;S. 113</a>, 165 (1973).  In the companion case <em>Doe </em>v.<em> Bolton</em>, <a aria-label=\"410 U.S. 179\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/410/179\">410 U.&nbsp;S. 179 (1973)</a>, the Court wrote that a doctor, in judging whether an abortion was needed to preserve a pregnant woman’s health, could consider “all factors—physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman’s age—relevant to the well-being of the patient.”  <em>Id</em>., at 192.  That decision was viewed by many as essentially preventing States from restricting post-viability abortions.<a aria-label=\"reference 25 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-25\" id=\"DISSENT_7-25ref\"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup></a>  As Harvard &nbsp;Law School Professor Mary Ann Glendon put it: “[W]hen <em>Roe</em> is read with <em>Doe</em>, third-trimester restrictions are effectively ruled out as well—for <em>Roe</em>’s dictum that such restrictions might be permissible if they did not interfere with the mother’s health was negated by <em>Doe</em>’s definition of ‘health’ as ‘well-being.’&nbsp;”  The Women of <em>Roe</em> v. <em>Wade </em>(2003).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Solicitor General tried to explain why the Government’s interpretation would not lead down this path, but her explanation is hard to understand.

In 2020, with the outbreak of COVID–19, the platforms announced that they would enforce these policies against users who post false or misleading content about the pandemic.  The platforms also applied misinformation policies during the 2020 election season.  During that period, various federal officials regularly spoke with the platforms about COVID–19 and election-related misinformation.  For example, White House officials publicly and privately called on the platforms to do more to address vaccine misinformation.  Surgeon General Vivek Murthy issued a health advisory that encouraged the platforms to take steps to prevent COVID–19 misinformation “from taking hold.”  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention alerted the platforms to COVID–19 misinformation trends and flagged example posts.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency communicated with the platforms about election-related misinformation in advance of the 2020 Presidential election and the 2022 midterms.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-d jy-both indent_l-187 indent_h-187\">  Respondents are two States and five individual social-media users who sued dozens of Executive Branch officials and agencies, alleging that the Government pressured the platforms to censor their speech in violation of the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>.  Following extensive discovery, the District Court issued a preliminary injunction.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part.  The court held that both the state plaintiffs and the individual plaintiffs had Article III standing to seek injunctive relief.  On the merits, the court held that the Government &nbsp;entities and officials, by “coerc[ing]” or “significantly encourag[ing]” the platforms’ moderation decisions, transformed those decisions into state action.  The court then modified the District Court’s injunction to state that the defendants shall not coerce or significantly encourage social-media companies to suppress protected speech on their platforms.  </p>\n<p class=\"sylct-e jy-both indent_l-187 indent_h-187\"><em>Held</em>:&nbsp;Neither the individual nor the state plaintiffs have established Article III standing to seek an injunction against any defendant.  Pp.&nbsp;8–29.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-e jy-both indent_l-187 indent_h-187\">  (a)&nbsp;Article III’s “case or controversy” requirement is “fundamental” to the “proper role” of the Judiciary.  <em>Raines</em> v. <em>Byrd</em>, <a aria-label=\"521 U. S. 811\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/521/811\">521 U.&nbsp;S. 811</a>, 818.  A proper case or controversy exists only when at least one plaintiff “establish[es] that [she] ha[s] standing to sue,” <em>ibid.—i.e., </em>that she has suffered, or will suffer, an injury that is “concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent; fairly traceable to the challenged action; and redressable by a favorable ruling,” <em>Clapper</em> v. <em>Amnesty Int’l USA</em>, <a aria-label=\"568 U. S. 398\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/568/398\">568 U.&nbsp;S. 398</a>, 409.  Here, the plaintiffs’ theories of standing depend on the <em>platforms’ </em>actions—yet the plaintiffs do not seek to enjoin the platforms from restricting any posts or accounts.  Instead, they seek to enjoin the <em>Government agencies and officials</em> from pressuring or encouraging the platforms to suppress protected speech in the future.  </p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> The one-step-removed, anticipatory nature of the plaintiffs’ alleged injuries presents two particular challenges.  First, it is a bedrock principle that a federal court cannot redress “injury that results from the independent action of some third party not before the court.”  <em>Simon</em> v. <em>Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization</em>, <a aria-label=\"426 U. S. 26\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/426/26\">426 U.&nbsp;S. 26</a>, 41–42.  Second, because the plaintiffs request forward-looking relief, they must face “a real and immediate threat of repeated injury.”  <em>O’Shea</em> v. <em>Littleton</em>, <a aria-label=\"414 U. S. 488\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/414/488\">414 U.&nbsp;S. 488</a>, 496.  Putting these requirements together, the plaintiffs must show a substantial risk that, in the near future, at least one platform will restrict the speech of at least one plaintiff in response to the actions of at least one Government defendant.  Here, at the preliminary injunction stage, they must show that they are likely to succeed in carrying that burden.  On the record in this case, that is a tall order.  Pp.&nbsp;8–10.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> (b)&nbsp;The plaintiffs’ primary theory of standing involves their “direct censorship injuries.”  Pp.&nbsp;10–26.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\">  (1)&nbsp;The Court first considers whether the plaintiffs have demonstrated traceability for their past injuries.  Because the plaintiffs are seeking only forward-looking relief, the past injuries are relevant only for their predictive value.  The primary weakness in the record of past restrictions is the lack of specific causation findings with respect to any discrete instance of content moderation.  And while the record reflects that the Government defendants played a role in at least some of the &nbsp;platforms’ moderation choices, the evidence indicates that the platforms had independent incentives to moderate content and often exercised their own judgment.  The Fifth Circuit, by attributing every platform decision at least in part to the defendants, glossed over complexities in the evidence.  The Fifth Circuit also erred by treating the defendants, plaintiffs, and platforms each as a unified whole.  Because “standing is not dispensed in gross,” <em>TransUnion LLC</em> v. <em>Ramirez</em>, <a aria-label=\"594 U. S. 413\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/594/413\">594 U.&nbsp;S. 413</a>, 431, “plaintiffs must demonstrate standing for each claim they press” against each defendant, “and for each form of relief they seek,” <em>ibid.  </em>This requires a threshold showing that a particular defendant pressured a particular platform to censor a particular topic <em>before</em> that platform suppressed a particular plaintiff’s speech on that topic.  Complicating the plaintiffs’ effort to demonstrate that each platform acted due to Government coercion, rather than its own judgment, is the fact that the platforms began to suppress the plaintiffs’ COVID–19 content before the defendants’ challenged communications started.  Pp.&nbsp;10–14.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\">  (2)&nbsp;The plaintiffs fail, by and large, to link their past social-media restrictions and the defendants’ communications with the platforms.  The state plaintiffs, Louisiana and Missouri, refer only to action taken by Facebook against a Louisiana state representative’s post about children and the COVID–19 vaccine.  But they never say when Facebook took action against the official’s post—a critical fact in establishing a causal link.  Nor have the three plaintiff doctors established a likelihood that their past restrictions are traceable to either the White House officials or the CDC.  They highlight restrictions imposed by Twitter and LinkedIn, but point only to Facebook’s communications with White House officials.  Plaintiff Jim Hoft, who runs a news website, experienced election-related restrictions on various platforms.  He points to the FBI’s role in the platforms’ adoption of hacked-material policies and claims that Twitter restricted his content pursuant to those policies.  Yet Hoft’s declaration reveals that Twitter took action according to its own rules against posting private, intimate media without consent.  Hoft does not provide evidence that his past injuries are likely traceable to the FBI or CISA.  Plaintiff Jill Hines, a healthcare activist, faced COVID–19-related restrictions on Facebook.  Though she makes the best showing of all the plaintiffs, most of the lines she draws are tenuous.  Plus, Facebook started targeting her content before almost all of its communications with the White House and the CDC, thus weakening the inference that her subsequent restrictions are likely traceable to Government-coerced enforcement of Facebook’s policies.  Even assuming Hines can eke out a showing of traceability, the past is relevant only insofar as it predicts the future.  Pp.&nbsp;14–21.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\">&nbsp;  (3)&nbsp;To obtain forward-looking relief, the plaintiffs must establish a substantial risk of future injury that is traceable to the Government defendants and likely to be redressed by an injunction against them.  The plaintiffs who have not pointed to any past restrictions likely traceable to the Government defendants (<em>i</em>.<em>e</em>., everyone other than Hines) are ill suited to the task of establishing their standing to seek forward-looking relief.  But even Hines, with her superior showing on past harm, has not shown enough to demonstrate likely future harm at the hands of these defendants.  On this record, it appears that the frequent, intense communications that took place in 2021 between the Government defendants and the platforms had considerably subsided by 2022, when Hines filed suit.  Thus it is “no more than conjecture” to assume that Hines will be subject to Government-induced content moderation.  <em>Los Angeles </em>v.<em> Lyons</em>, <a aria-label=\"461 U. S. 95\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/461/95\">461 U.&nbsp;S. 95</a>, 108.  </p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> The plaintiffs’ counterarguments are unpersuasive.  First, they argue that they suffer “continuing, present adverse effects” from their past restrictions, as they must now self-censor on social media.  <em>O’Shea</em>, 414 U.&nbsp;S., at 496.  But the plaintiffs “cannot manufacture standing merely by inflicting harm on themselves based on their fears of hypothetical future harm that is not certainly impending.”  <em>Clapper</em>, 568 U.&nbsp;S., at 416.  Second, the plaintiffs suggest that the platforms continue to suppress their speech according to policies initially adopted under Government pressure.  But the plaintiffs have a redressability problem.  Without evidence of continued pressure from the defendants, the platforms remain free to enforce, or not to enforce, their policies—even those tainted by initial governmental coercion.  And the available evidence indicates that the platforms have continued to enforce their policies against COVID–19 misinformation even as the Federal Government has wound down its own pandemic response measures.  Enjoining the Government defendants, therefore, is unlikely to affect the platforms’ content-moderation decisions.  Pp.&nbsp;21–27.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> (c)&nbsp;The plaintiffs next assert a “right to listen” theory of standing. The individual plaintiffs argue that the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> protects their interest in reading and engaging with the content of other speakers on social media.  This theory is startlingly broad, as it would grant all social-media users the right to sue over <em>someone else’s</em> censorship—at least so long as they claim an interest in that person’s speech.  While the Court has recognized a “<a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> right to receive information and ideas,” the Court has identified a cognizable injury only where the listener has a concrete, specific connection to the speaker.  <em>Kleindienst</em> v. <em>Mandel</em>, <a aria-label=\"408 U. S. 753\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/408/753\">408 U.&nbsp;S. 753</a>, 762.  Attempting to satisfy this requirement, the plaintiffs emphasize that hearing unfettered speech &nbsp;on social media is critical to their work as scientists, pundits, and activists.  But they do not point to any specific instance of content moderation that caused them identifiable harm.  They have therefore failed to establish an injury that is sufficiently “concrete and particularized.”  <em>Lujan</em> v. <em>Defenders of Wildlife</em>, <a aria-label=\"504 U. S. 555\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/504/555\">504 U.&nbsp;S. 555</a>, 560.  The state plaintiffs assert a sovereign interest in hearing from their citizens on social media, but they have not identified any specific speakers or topics that they have been unable to hear or follow.  And States do not have third-party “standing as <em>parens patriae </em>to bring an action against the Federal Government” on behalf of their citizens who have faced social-media restrictions.  <em>Haaland</em> v. <em>Brackeen</em>, <a aria-label=\"599 U.

At the same time, federal officials, concerned about the spread of “misinformation” on social media, communicated extensively with the platforms about their content-moderation efforts.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The plaintiffs, two States and five social-media users, sued dozens of Executive Branch officials and agencies, alleging that they pressured the platforms to suppress protected speech in violation of the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>.  The Fifth Circuit agreed, concluding that the officials’ communications rendered them responsible for the private platforms’ moderation decisions.  It then affirmed a sweeping preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Fifth Circuit was wrong to do so.  To establish standing, the plaintiffs must demonstrate a substantial risk that, in the near future, they will suffer an injury that is traceable to a Government defendant and redressable by the injunction they seek.  Because no plaintiff has carried that burden, none has standing to seek a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">&nbsp;I</h3>\n<h4 class=\"jy-center\">A</h4>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> With their billions of active users, the world’s major social-media companies host a “staggering” amount of content on their platforms.  <em>Twitter, Inc. </em>v.<em> Taamneh</em>, <a aria-label=\"598 U. S. 471\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/598/471\">598 U.&nbsp;S. 471</a>, 480 (2023).  Yet for many of these companies, including Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, not everything goes.<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Barrett Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-1\" id=\"OPINION_4-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a>  Under their longstanding content-moderation policies, the platforms have taken a range of actions to suppress certain categories of speech.  They place warning labels on some posts, while deleting others.  They also “demote” content so that it is less visible to other users.  And they may suspend or ban users who frequently post content that violates platform policies.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> For years, the platforms have targeted speech they judge to be false or misleading.  For instance, in 2016, Facebook began fact checking and demoting posts containing misleading claims about elections.  Since 2018, Facebook has removed health-related misinformation, including false claims about a measles outbreak in Samoa and the polio vaccine in Pakistan.  Likewise, in 2019, YouTube announced that it would “demonetize” channels that promote anti-vaccine messages.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In 2020, with the outbreak of COVID–19, the platforms announced that they would enforce their policies against users who post false or misleading content about the pandemic.  As early as January 2020, Facebook deleted posts it deemed false regarding “cures,” “treatments,” and the effect of “physical distancing.”  60 Record on Appeal 19,035 (Record).  And it demoted posts containing what it described as “conspiracy theories about the origin of the virus.”  <em>Id</em>., at &nbsp;19,036.  Twitter and YouTube began applying their policies in March and May 2020, respectively.  Throughout the pandemic, the platforms removed or reduced posts questioning the efficacy and safety of mask wearing and the COVID–19 vaccine, along with posts on related topics.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The platforms also applied their misinformation policies during the 2020 Presidential election season.  Facebook, in late 2019, unveiled measures to counter foreign interference campaigns and voter suppression efforts.  One month before the election, multiple platforms suppressed a report about Hunter Biden’s laptop, believing that the story originated from a Russian hack-and-leak operation.  After the election, the platforms took action against users or posts that questioned the integrity of the election results.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Over the past few years, various federal officials regularly spoke with the platforms about COVID–19 and &nbsp;election-related misinformation.  Officials at the White House, the Office of the Surgeon General, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) focused on COVID–19 content, while the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) concentrated on elections.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>White House</em>.  In early 2021, and continuing primarily through that year, the Director of Digital Strategy and members of the COVID–19 response team interacted with the platforms about their efforts to suppress vaccine misinformation.  They expressed concern that Facebook in particular was “one of the top drivers of vaccine hesitancy,” due to the spread of allegedly false or misleading claims on the platform.  App. 659–660.  Thus, the officials peppered Facebook (and to a lesser extent, Twitter and YouTube) with detailed questions about their policies, pushed them to suppress certain content, and sometimes recommended policy changes.  Some of these communications were more aggressive than others.  For example, the director of Digital Strategy, frustrated that Facebook had not removed a particular &nbsp;post, complained: “[L]ast time we did this dance, it ended in an insurrection.”  <em>Id</em>., at 698.  Another official, unhappy with Facebook’s supposed lack of transparency about its vaccine misinformation problems, wrote: “Internally we have been considering our options on what to do about it.”  <em>Id</em>., at 657.  Publicly, White House communications officials called on the platforms to do more to address COVID–19 misinformation—and, perhaps as motivation, raised the possibility of reforms aimed at the platforms, including changes to the antitrust laws and <a aria-label=\"47 USC 230\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230\">47 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §230</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Surgeon General</em>.  In July 2021, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy issued a health advisory on misinformation.  The advisory encouraged platforms to “[r]edesign recommendation algorithms to avoid amplifying misinformation,” “[i]mpose clear consequences for accounts that repeatedly violate platform policies,” and “[p]rovide information from trusted and credible sources to prevent misconceptions from taking hold.”  3 Record 662.  At a press conference to announce the advisory, Surgeon General Murthy argued that the platforms should “operate with greater transparency and accountability.”  2 <em>id</em>., at 626.  The following year, the Surgeon General issued a “Request for Information,” seeking, among other things, reports on each platform’s “COVID–19 misinformation policies.”  Impact of Health Misinformation in the Digital Information Environment in the United States Throughout the COVID–19 Pandemic Request for Information (RFI), <a aria-label=\"87 FR 12714\" href=\"/rio/citation/87_FR_12714\">87 Fed. Reg. 12714</a> (Mar. 7, 2022).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>CDC</em>.<em> </em>Like the White House, the CDC frequently communicated with the platforms about COVID–19 misinformation.  In early 2020, Facebook reached out to the agency, seeking authoritative information about the virus that it could post on the platform.  The following year, the CDC’s communications expanded to other platforms, including Twitter and YouTube.  The CDC hosted meetings and sent reports to the platforms, alerting them to misinformation &nbsp;trends and flagging example posts.  The platforms often asked the agency for fact checks on specific claims.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>FBI and CISA</em>.  These agencies communicated with the platforms about election-related misinformation.  They hosted meetings with several platforms in advance of the 2020 Presidential election and the 2022 midterms.  The FBI alerted the platforms to posts containing false information about voting, as well as pernicious foreign influence campaigns that might spread on their sites.  Shortly before the 2020 election, the FBI warned the platforms about the potential for a Russian hack-and-leak operation.  Some companies then updated their moderation policies to prohibit users from posting hacked materials.  Until mid-2022, CISA, through its “switchboarding” operations, forwarded third-party reports of election-related misinformation to the platforms.  These communications typically stated that the agency “w[ould] not take any action, favorable or unfavorable, toward social media companies based on decisions about how or whether to use this information.”  72 Record 23,223.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Respondents are two States and five individual social-media users.  They were the plaintiffs below, and for the sake of narrative clarity, we will refer to them as “plaintiffs” in this opinion.  (Likewise, we will refer to the Government individuals and agencies as “defendants” rather than petitioners.)  The individual plaintiffs—three doctors, the owner of a news website, and a healthcare activist—allege that various platforms removed or demoted their COVID–19 or election-related content between 2020 and 2023.  The States, Missouri and Louisiana, claim that the platforms have suppressed the speech of state entities and officials, as well as their citizens’ speech.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Though the platforms restricted the plaintiffs’ content, the plaintiffs maintain that the Federal Government was &nbsp;behind it.  Acting on that belief, the plaintiffs sued dozens of Executive Branch officials and agencies, alleging that they pressured the platforms to censor the plaintiffs’ speech in violation of the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>.  The States filed their complaint on May 5, 2022.  The next month, they moved for a preliminary injunction, seeking to stop the defendants from “taking any steps to demand, urge, encourage, pressure, or otherwise induce” any platform “to censor, suppress, remove, de-platform, suspend, shadow-ban, de-boost, restrict access to content, or take any other adverse action against any speaker, content, or viewpoint expressed on social media.”  1 <em>id</em>., at 253.  The individual plaintiffs joined the suit on August 2, 2022.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> After granting extensive discovery, the District Court issued a preliminary injunction.  <em>Missouri </em>v.<em> Biden</em>, 680 F.&nbsp;Supp. 3d 630, 729 (WD La. 2023).  The court held that officials at the White House, the Surgeon General’s Office, the CDC, the FBI, and CISA likely “coerced” or “significantly encouraged” the platforms “to such extent that the[ir content-moderation] decision[s] should be deemed to be the decisions of the Government.”  <em>Id</em>., at 694 (internal quotation marks omitted).  It enjoined those agencies, along with scores of named and unnamed officials and employees, from taking actions “for the purpose of urging, encouraging, pressuring, or inducing in any manner the removal, deletion, suppression, or reduction of content containing protected free speech posted on social-medial platforms.”  <em>Missouri </em>v.<em> Biden</em>, 2023 WL 5841935, *1–*2 (WD La., July 4, 2023).<a aria-label=\"reference 2 of Barrett Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-2\" id=\"OPINION_4-2ref\"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Following a grant of panel rehearing, the Fifth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part.  <em>Missouri </em>v.<em> Biden</em>, 83 &nbsp;F.&nbsp;4th 350 (2023).  It first held that the individual plaintiffs had Article III standing to seek injunctive relief, reasoning that the social-media companies had suppressed the plaintiffs’ speech in the past and were likely to do so again in the future, <em>id</em>., at 367–369, and that both of these injuries were “traceable to government-coerced enforcement” of the platform’s policies and “redressable by an injunction against the government officials,” <em>id</em>., at 373.  The court also concluded that the States had standing, both because the platforms had restricted the posts of individual state officials and because the States have the “right to listen” to their citizens on social media.  <em>Id</em>., at 371–372.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> On the merits, the Fifth Circuit explained that “a private party’s conduct may be state action if the government coerced or significantly encouraged it.”  <em>Id</em>., at 380 (citing <em>Blum </em>v.<em> Yaretsky</em>, <a aria-label=\"457 U. S. 991\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/457/991\">457 U.&nbsp;S. 991</a>, 1004 (1982); emphasis deleted).  To identify coercion, it asked whether “the government compelled the [private party’s] decision by .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. intimating that some form of punishment will follow a failure to comply.”  83 F.&nbsp;4th, at 380.  The court explained that the Government significantly encourages a private party’s choice when it exercises “active, meaningful control, whether by entanglement in the party’s decision-making process or direct involvement in carrying out the decision itself.”  <em>Id</em>., at 377.<a aria-label=\"reference 3 of Barrett Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-3\" id=\"OPINION_4-3ref\"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Applying those tests, the Fifth Circuit determined that White House officials, in conjunction with the Surgeon General’s Office, likely both coerced <em>and</em> significantly encouraged the platforms to moderate content.  <em>Id</em>., at 388.  The court concluded that the same was true for the FBI.  <em>Ibid.  </em>It held that the CDC and CISA significantly encouraged (but did not coerce) the platforms’ moderation decisions.  <em>Id</em>., at 389, 391.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Fifth Circuit agreed with the District Court that the equities favored the plaintiffs.  <em>Id</em>., at 392–394.  It then modified the District Court’s injunction to state that the defendants, and their employees and agents, shall not “&nbsp;‘coerce or significantly encourage social-media companies to remove, delete, suppress, or reduce, including through altering their algorithms, posted social-media content containing protected free speech.’&nbsp;”  <em>Id</em>., at 397.  The court did not limit the injunction to the platforms that the plaintiffs use or the topics that the plaintiffs wish to discuss, explaining that the harms stemming from the defendants’ conduct “impac[t] every social-media user.”  <em>Id</em>., at 398.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The federal agencies and officials applied to this Court for emergency relief.  We stayed the injunction, treated the application as a petition for a writ of certiorari, and granted the petition.  601 U.&nbsp;S. ___ (2023).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">II</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> We begin—and end—with standing.  At this stage, neither the individual nor the state plaintiffs have established standing to seek an injunction against any defendant.  We therefore lack jurisdiction to reach the merits of the dispute.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">A</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Article III of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to “Cases” and “Controversies.”  The “case or controversy” requirement is “&nbsp;‘fundamental to the judiciary’s proper role in our system of government.’&nbsp;”  <em>Raines </em>v.<em> Byrd</em>, <a aria-label=\"521 U. S. 811\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/521/811\">521 U.&nbsp;S. 811</a>, 818 (1997) (quoting <em>Simon</em> v. <em>Eastern Ky.

Federal courts can only review statutes and executive actions when necessary “to redress or prevent actual or imminently threatened injury to persons caused by .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. official violation of law.”  <em>Summers </em>v.<em> Earth Island Institute</em>, 555 &nbsp;U.&nbsp;S. 488, 492 (2009).  As this Court has explained, “[i]f a dispute is not a proper case or controversy, the courts have no business deciding it, or expounding the law in the course of doing so.”  <em>DaimlerChrysler Corp. </em>v.<em> Cuno</em>, <a aria-label=\"547 U. S. 332\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/547/332\">547 U.&nbsp;S. 332</a>, 341 (2006).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> A proper case or controversy exists only when at least one plaintiff “establish[es] that [she] ha[s] standing to sue.”  <em>Raines</em>, 521 U.&nbsp;S., at 818; <em>Department of Commerce </em>v.<em> New York</em>, <a aria-label=\"588 U.

She must show that she has suffered, or will suffer, an injury that is “concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent; fairly traceable to the challenged action; and redressable by a favorable ruling.”  <em>Clapper </em>v.<em> Amnesty Int’l USA</em>, <a aria-label=\"568 U.

These requirements help ensure that the plaintiff has “such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to warrant [her] invocation of federal-court jurisdiction.”  <em>Summers</em>, 555 U.&nbsp;S., at 493 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The plaintiffs claim standing based on the “direct censorship” of their own speech as well as their “right to listen” to others who faced social-media censorship.  Brief for Respondents 19, 22.  Notably, both theories depend on the <em>platform’s</em> actions—yet the plaintiffs do not seek to enjoin the platforms from restricting any posts or accounts.  They seek to enjoin <em>Government agencies and officials </em>from pressuring or encouraging the platforms to suppress protected speech in the future.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The one-step-removed, anticipatory nature of their alleged injuries presents the plaintiffs with two particular challenges.  <em>First</em>, it is a bedrock principle that a federal court cannot redress “injury that results from the independent action of some third party not before the court.”  <em>Simon</em>, 426 U.&nbsp;S., at 41–42.  In keeping with this principle, we have “been reluctant to endorse standing theories that require guesswork as to how independent decisionmakers will exercise their judgment.”  <em>Clapper</em>, 568 U.&nbsp;S., at 413.  Rather &nbsp;than guesswork, the plaintiffs must show that the third-party platforms “will likely react in predictable ways” to the defendants’ conduct.  <em>Department of Commerce</em>, 588 U.&nbsp;S., at 768.  <em>Second</em>, because the plaintiffs request forward-looking relief, they must face “a real and immediate threat of repeated injury.”  <em>O’Shea </em>v.<em> Littleton</em>, <a aria-label=\"414 U. S. 488\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/414/488\">414 U.&nbsp;S. 488</a>, 496 (1974); see also <em>Susan B. Anthony List </em>v.<em> Driehaus</em>, <a aria-label=\"573 U. S. 149\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/573/149\">573 U.&nbsp;S. 149</a>, 158 (2014) (“An allegation of future injury may suffice if the threatened injury is certainly impending, or there is a substantial risk that the harm will occur” (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Putting these requirements together, the plaintiffs must show a substantial risk that, in the near future, at least one platform will restrict the speech of at least one plaintiff in response to the actions of at least one Government defendant.  On this record, that is a tall order.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Before we evaluate the plaintiffs’ different theories, a few preliminaries: The plaintiff “bears the burden of establishing standing as of the time [s]he brought th[e] lawsuit and maintaining it thereafter.”  <em>Carney </em>v.<em> Adams</em>, <a aria-label=\"592 U. S. 53\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/592/53\">592 U.&nbsp;S. 53</a>, 59 (2020).  She must support each element of standing “with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.”  <em>Lujan </em>v.<em> Defenders of Wildlife</em>, <a aria-label=\"504 U. S. 555\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/504/555\">504 U.&nbsp;S. 555</a>, 561 (1992).  At the preliminary injunction stage, then, the plaintiff must make a “clear showing” that she is “likely” to establish each element of standing.  See <em>Winter </em>v.<em> Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"555 U. S. 7\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/555/7\">555 U.&nbsp;S. 7</a>, 22 (2008) (emphasis deleted).  Where, as here, the parties have taken discovery, the plaintiff cannot rest on “mere allegations,” but must instead point to factual evidence.  See <em>Lujan</em>, 504 U.&nbsp;S., at 561 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<h4 class=\"jy-center\">1</h4>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The plaintiffs’ primary theory of standing involves their &nbsp;“direct censorship injuries.”  They claim that the restrictions they have experienced in the past on various platforms are traceable to the defendants and that the platforms will continue to censor their speech at the behest of the defendants.  So we first consider whether the plaintiffs have demonstrated traceability for their past injuries.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Here, a note of caution: If the plaintiffs were seeking compensatory relief, the traceability of their past injuries would be the whole ball game.  But because the plaintiffs are seeking only forward-looking relief, the past injuries are relevant only for their predictive value.  See <em>O’Shea</em>, 414 U.&nbsp;S., at 495–496 (“Past exposure to illegal conduct” can serve as evidence of threatened future injury but “does not in itself show a present case or controversy regarding injunctive relief&nbsp;”).  If a plaintiff demonstrates that a particular Government defendant was behind her past social-media restriction, it will be easier for her to prove that she faces a continued risk of future restriction that is likely to be traceable to that same defendant.  Conversely, if a plaintiff cannot trace her past injury to one of the defendants, it will be much harder for her to make that showing.  See <em>Clapper</em>, 568 U.&nbsp;S., at 411.  In the latter situation, the plaintiff would essentially have to build her case from scratch, showing why she has some newfound reason to fear that one of the named defendants will coerce her chosen platform to restrict future speech on a topic about which she plans to post—in this case, either COVID–19 or the upcoming election.  Keep in mind, therefore, that the past is relevant only insofar as it is a launching pad for a showing of imminent future injury.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The primary weakness in the record of past restrictions is the lack of specific causation findings with respect to any discrete instance of content moderation.  The District Court made none.  Nor did the Fifth Circuit, which approached standing at a high level of generality.  The platforms, it reasoned, “have engaged in censorship of certain viewpoints on &nbsp;key issues,” while “the government has engaged in a years-long pressure campaign” to ensure that the platforms suppress those viewpoints.  83 F.&nbsp;4th, at 370.  The platforms’ “censorship decisions”—including those affecting the plaintiffs—were thus “likely attributable at least in part to the platforms’ reluctance to risk” the consequences of refusing to “adhere to the government’s directives.”  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> We reject this overly broad assertion.  As already discussed, the platforms moderated similar content long before any of the Government defendants engaged in the challenged conduct.  In fact, the platforms, acting independently, had strengthened their pre-existing content-moderation policies before the Government defendants got involved.  For instance, Facebook announced an expansion of its COVID–19 misinformation policies in early February 2021, before White House officials began communicating with the platform.  And the platforms continued to exercise their independent judgment even after communications with the defendants began.  For example, on several occasions, various platforms explained that White House officials had flagged content that did not violate company policy.  Moreover, the platforms did not speak only with the defendants about content moderation; they also regularly consulted with outside experts.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This evidence indicates that the platforms had independent incentives to moderate content and often exercised their own judgment.  To be sure, the record reflects that the Government defendants played a role in at least some of the platforms’ moderation choices.  But the Fifth Circuit, by attributing <em>every </em>platform decision at least in part to the defendants, glossed over complexities in the evidence.<a aria-label=\"reference 4 of Barrett Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-4\" id=\"OPINION_4-4ref\"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; The Fifth Circuit also erred by treating the defendants, plaintiffs, and platforms each as a unified whole.  Our decisions make clear that “standing is not dispensed in gross.”  <em>TransUnion LLC </em>v.<em> Ramirez</em>, <a aria-label=\"594 U. S. 413\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/594/413\">594 U.&nbsp;S. 413</a>, 431 (2021).  That is, “plaintiffs must demonstrate standing for each claim that they press” against each defendant, “and for each form of relief that they seek.”  <em>Ibid</em>.  Here, for every defendant, there must be at least one plaintiff with standing to seek an injunction.  This requires a certain threshold showing: namely, that a particular defendant pressured a particular platform to censor a particular topic <em>before</em> that platform suppressed a particular plaintiff&nbsp;’s speech on that topic.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Heeding these conditions is critically important in a sprawling suit like this one.  The plaintiffs faced speech restrictions on different platforms, about different topics, at &nbsp;different times.  Different groups of defendants communicated with different platforms, about different topics, at different times.  And even where the plaintiff, platform, time, content, and defendant line up, the links must be evaluated in light of the platform’s independent incentives to moderate content.  As discussed, the platforms began to suppress the plaintiffs’ COVID–19 content before the defendants’ challenged communications started, which complicates the plaintiffs’ effort to demonstrate that each platform acted due to “government-coerced enforcement” of its policies, 83 F.&nbsp;4th, at 370 (emphasis deleted), rather than in its own judgment as an “&nbsp;‘independent acto[r],’&nbsp;” <em>Lujan</em>, 504 U.&nbsp;S., at 562.  With these factors in mind, we proceed to untangle the mass of the plaintiffs’ injuries and Government communications.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">2</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The plaintiffs rely on allegations of past Government censorship as evidence that future censorship is likely.  But they fail, by and large, to link their past social-media restrictions to the defendants’ communications with the platforms.  Thus, the events of the past do little to help any of the plaintiffs establish standing to seek an injunction to prevent future harms.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Louisiana and Missouri</em>.  The state plaintiffs devote minimal attention to restriction of their own social-media content, much less to a causal link between any such restriction and the actions of any Government defendant.  They refer only to Facebook’s “flagg[ing] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and de-boost[ing]” of a Louisiana state representative’s post about children and the COVID–19 vaccine.  Brief for Respondents 20; App. 635–636.  We need not decide whether an injury to &nbsp;a state representative counts as an injury to the State, because evidence of causation is lacking.<a aria-label=\"reference 5 of Barrett Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-5\" id=\"OPINION_4-5ref\"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup></a>  The States assert only that in November 2021, Facebook, “as a result of [its] work [with the CDC],” updated its policies “to remove additional false claims about the COVID–19 vaccine for children.”  37 Record 11,457.  But they never say when Facebook took action against the official’s post—and a causal link is possible only if the removal occurred <em>after </em>Facebook’s communication with the CDC.  There is therefore no evidence to support the States’ allegation that Facebook restricted the state representative pursuant to the CDC-influenced policy.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Jayanta Bhattacharya, Martin Kulldorff, and Aaron Kheriarty</em>.  These plaintiffs are doctors who questioned the wisdom of then-prevailing COVID–19 policies, including lockdowns and mask and vaccine mandates.  Each faced his first social-media restriction in 2020, before the White House and the CDC entered discussions with the relevant platforms.  Plaintiffs highlight restrictions imposed by Twitter and LinkedIn, starting in 2021, on Dr. Kulldorff&nbsp;’s posts about natural immunity.  They also point out that Twitter restricted the visibility of Dr. Kheriarty’s posts about vaccine safety and efficacy, as well as the ethics surrounding vaccine mandates.  Attempting to show causation, the plaintiffs emphasize that in January 2022, Facebook reported to White House officials that it had recently demoted one post advocating for natural immunity over vaccine immunity.  But neither the timing nor the platforms line up (nor, in Dr. Kheriarty’s case, does the content), so the plaintiffs cannot show that these restrictions were traceable to the White House officials.  In fact, there is no record evidence that White House officials ever communicated at all &nbsp;with LinkedIn.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Drs. Bhattacharya and Kulldorff claim that, after disagreeing with the CDC and other federal health officials, they faced a “relentless covert campaign of social-media censorship.”  App. 585 (emphasis deleted).  They refer to the platforms’ suppression of the Great Barrington Declaration, their coauthored report calling for an end to lockdowns.  But their declarations do not suggest that anyone at the CDC was involved; rather, they point to officials at the National Institutes of Health and the NIAID.  Those entities are not before us.  With nothing else to show, Drs. Bhattacharya, Kulldorff, and Kheriarty have not established a likelihood that their past restrictions are traceable to either the White House officials or the CDC.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Jim Hoft</em>.  Both Hoft and his news website, “The Gateway Pundit,” experienced election and COVID–19-related restrictions on various platforms.  Hoft tries to demonstrate his standing to sue only the FBI and CISA, which means that only the suppression of his election-related posts is relevant.  (As already discussed, the record contains no evidence that either the FBI or CISA engaged with the platforms about the pandemic.)  First, Hoft points to the FBI’s role in the platforms’ adoption of hacked-material policies.  And he claims that Twitter, in December 2020, censored content about the Hunter Biden laptop story under such a policy.  The post was titled: “Where’s Hunter?  How is Hunter Celebrating the New Year?  New Photos of Hunter Biden Pushing Drugs on Women Emerge.”  Hoft’s own declaration reveals that Twitter acted according to its “rules against posting or sharing privately produced/distributed intimate media of someone without their express consent.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 608.  Hoft provides no evidence that Twitter adopted a policy against posting private, intimate content in response to the FBI’s warnings about hack-and-leak operations.  Plus, it was Hoft’s brother, Joe Hoft, who posted this tweet; Twitter therefore suspended <em>Joe </em>Hoft’s account.  It is &nbsp;unclear why Jim Hoft would have standing to sue for his brother’s injury.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Hoft claims that his content appears on a CISA document tracking posts that various entities had flagged for the platforms as misinformation.  The spreadsheet shows that a private entity, the Election Integrity Partnership—<em>not</em> CISA—alerted Twitter to an unidentified article from the Gateway Pundit.  And the spreadsheet does not reveal whether Twitter removed or otherwise suppressed that post.  This evidence does not support the conclusion that Hoft’s past injuries are likely traceable to the FBI or CISA.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Jill Hines</em>.  Of all the plaintiffs, Hines makes the best showing of a connection between her social-media restrictions and communications between the relevant platform (Facebook) and specific defendants (CDC and the White House).  That said, most of the lines she draws are tenuous, particularly given her burden of proof at the preliminary injunction stage—recall that she must show that her restrictions are <em>likely</em> traceable to the White House and the CDC.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> A healthcare activist, Hines codirects “Health Freedom Louisiana,” a group that advocated against COVID–19 mask and vaccine mandates.  In October 2020—before the start of communications with the White House and the bulk of communications with the CDC—Facebook began to reduce the reach of Hines’ and Health Freedom’s pages.  Hines tries to connect Facebook’s subsequent actions against her to both the White House officials and the CDC.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> First, Facebook “deplatformed” (<em>i</em>.<em>e</em>., deleted) one of Health Freedom’s groups in July 2021.  The last post in the group asked members to contact state legislators about health freedom legislation.  Three months earlier, a White House official sent Facebook several “suggestions” that were “circulating around the building and informing thinking,” including that the platform should “end group recom&nbsp;mendations for groups with a history of COVID–19 or vaccine misinformation.”  54 Record 16,870–16,871.  A week later, Facebook replied that it had “already removed all health groups from our recommendation feature.”  App. 716.  It is hard to know what to make of this.  Facebook reported that it had <em>already</em> acted, which tends to imply that Facebook made its decision independently of the White House.  Moreover, Facebook and the White House communicated about removing groups from recommendation features, not deleting them altogether—further weakening the inference that Facebook was implementing White House policy rather than its own.<a aria-label=\"reference 6 of Barrett Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-6\" id=\"OPINION_4-6ref\"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Next, in April 2023, Facebook gave Hines a warning after she reposted content from Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.  Two years earlier, White House officials had pushed Facebook to remove the accounts of the “disinformation dozen,” 12 people (including Kennedy) supposedly responsible for a majority of COVID–19-related misinformation.  Hines tries to link the warning she received to this earlier White House pressure.  Again, though, the link is weak.  There is no evidence that the White House asked Facebook to censor every user who<em> reposts </em>a member of the disinformation dozen, nor did Facebook change its policies to do so.  Facebook’s 2023 warning to Hines bears only a tangential relationship to the White House’s 2021 directive to Facebook.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Hines traces her remaining restrictions to the CDC.  Beginning in October 2020, Facebook fact checked Hines’ posts about pregnant women taking the COVID–19 vaccine, &nbsp;along with posts including data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).  And in March 2021, the CDC flagged several misinformation trends for Facebook, including claims related to pregnancy and VAERS data.  Because Hines does not provide dates for the fact checks, we cannot know whether the CDC could be responsible.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In May 2022, Facebook restricted Hines’ account for posting an article discussing increased rates of myocarditis in teenagers following vaccination.  A little over a year earlier, the CDC warned Facebook against claims of “unsubstantiated links to new [vaccine] side effects,” including “&nbsp;‘irritab[ility],’&nbsp;” “&nbsp;‘auto-immune issues, infertility,’&nbsp;” and “&nbsp;‘neurological damage including lowered IQ.’&nbsp;”  54 Record 17,042–17,043 (emphasis deleted).  There is no evidence that the CDC ever listed myocarditis as an unsubstantiated side effect—but because it is an alleged side effect, it at least falls under the same umbrella as the CDC’s communication.  Health Freedom’s February 2023 violation, by contrast, was for posting that vaccine manufacturers would not compensate those with vaccine-related injuries—a topic that bears little resemblance to the content that the CDC flagged.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In April 2023, Hines received violations for posts about children and the vaccine.  In November 2021, Facebook worked with the CDC to update its policies to remove additional false claims including that “&nbsp;‘the COVID vaccine is not safe for kids.’&nbsp;”  37 <em>id</em>., at 11,457.  It is not clear that either of Hines’ posts violated the CDC-influenced policy against false claims related to children and the vaccine.  One simply referred to the World Health Organization’s COVID–19 vaccine recommendations for children, and the other discussed the role of children within the “predatory” pharmaceutical industry.  App. 789–790.  Given the loose match between the policy and the posts, it is hard to call it “likely” that Facebook was enforcing the CDC’s preferences &nbsp;rather than its own.<a aria-label=\"reference 7 of Barrett Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-7\" id=\"OPINION_4-7ref\"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> With one or two potentially viable links, Hines makes the best showing of all the plaintiffs.  Still, Facebook was targeting her pages before almost all of its communications with the White House and the CDC, which weakens the inference that her subsequent restrictions are likely traceable to “government-coerced enforcement” of Facebook’s policies, 83 F.&nbsp;4th, at 370 (emphasis deleted), rather than to Facebook’s independent judgment.<a aria-label=\"reference 8 of Barrett Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-8\" id=\"OPINION_4-8ref\"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup></a>  Even assuming, however, &nbsp;that Hines has eked out a showing of traceability for her past injuries, the past is relevant only insofar as it predicts the future.  And this weak record gives her little momentum going forward.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">3</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> To obtain forward-looking relief, the plaintiffs must establish a substantial risk of future injury that is traceable to the Government defendants and likely to be redressed by an injunction against them.  To carry that burden, the plaintiffs must proffer evidence that the defendants’ “allegedly wrongful behavior w[ould] <em>likely</em> occur or continue.”  <em>Friends of the Earth, Inc. </em>v.<em> Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"528 U. S. 167\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/528/167\">528 U.&nbsp;S. 167</a>, 190 (2000).  At the preliminary injunction stage, the plaintiffs must show that they are likely to succeed in carrying that burden.  See <em>Winter</em>, 555 U.&nbsp;S., at 22.  But without proof of an ongoing pressure campaign, it is entirely speculative that the platforms’ future moderation decisions will be attributable, even in part, to the defendants.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The plaintiffs treat the defendants as a monolith, claiming broadly that “&nbsp;‘the governmen[t]’&nbsp;” continues to communicate with the platforms about “&nbsp;‘content-moderation issues.’&nbsp;”  Brief for Respondents 29 (quoting 83 F.&nbsp;4th, at 369).  But we must confirm that <em>each</em> Government defendant continues to engage in the challenged conduct, which is “coercion” and “significant encouragement,” not mere “communication.”  Plus, the plaintiffs have only explicitly identified an interest in speaking about COVID–19 or elections—so the defendants’ discussions about content-moderation issues must focus on those topics.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> We begin with the plaintiffs who have not pointed to any past restrictions likely traceable to the Government defendants.  This failure to establish traceability for past harms—which can serve as evidence of expected future harm—“substantially undermines [the plaintiffs’] standing theory.”  <em>Clapper</em>, 568 U.&nbsp;S., at 411.  These plaintiffs (<em>i.e.,</em> everyone other than Hines) are thus particularly ill suited to the task of establishing their standing to seek forward-looking relief.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Take Hoft, the only plaintiff who has expressed interest in speaking about elections (and thus the only plaintiff with potential standing to sue the FBI and CISA).  The FBI’s challenged conduct was ongoing at the time of the complaint, as the agency worked with the platforms during the 2022 midterm election season.  Still, Hoft must rely on a “speculative chain of possibilities” to establish a likelihood of future harm traceable to the FBI.  <em>Id.</em>, at 414.  Hoft’s fu&nbsp;ture posts (presumably about the 2024 Presidential election) must contain content that falls within a misinformation trend that the FBI has identified or will identify in the future.  The FBI must pressure the platforms to remove content within that category.  The platform must then suppress Hoft’s post<em>,</em> and it must do so at least partly in response to the FBI, rather than in keeping with its own content-moderation policy.  Hoft cannot satisfy his burden with such conjecture.  CISA, meanwhile, stopped switchboarding in mid-2022, and the Government has represented that it will not resume operations for the 2024 election.  Especially in light of his poor showing of traceability in the past, Hoft has failed to demonstrate likely future injury at the hands of the FBI or CISA—so the injunction against those entities cannot survive.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The doctors and the state plaintiffs, who focus on COVID–19 content, have a similarly uphill battle vis-à-vis the White House, the Surgeon General’s Office, and the CDC.  Hines, with her superior showing on past harm, is in a slightly better position to demonstrate likely future harm at the hands of these defendants.  Still, she has not shown enough.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Starting with the White House and Surgeon General’s Office, the vast majority of their public and private engagement with the platforms occurred in 2021, when the pandemic was still in full swing.  By August 2022, when Hines joined the case, the officials’ communications about COVID–19 misinformation had slowed to a trickle.  Publicly, the White House Press Secretary made two statements in February and April 2022.  First, she said that the platforms should continue “call[ing] out misinformation and disinformation.”  3 Record 758.  Two months later, she spoke generally about §230 and antitrust reform, but did not mention content moderation or COVID–19 misinformation.  In March 2022, the Surgeon General issued a voluntary “Request for Information” from the platforms about &nbsp;their misinformation policies.<a aria-label=\"reference 9 of Barrett Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-9\" id=\"OPINION_4-9ref\"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Privately, Facebook sent monthly “Covid Insights” reports to officials in the White House and the Surgeon General’s Office, at least until July 2022.  These reports contained information about the top 100 vaccine-related posts in the United States, including whether Facebook took action against any of them.  In June, Facebook asked if it should continue sending these reports, as it had stopped seeing “problematic vaccine related” content in the top posts.  50 <em>id</em>., at 15,645–15,646.  The official replied that, though he would “normally say we are good to discontinue,” the reports would be helpful “as we start to ramp up .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. vaccines” for children under five.  <em>Id</em>., at 15,645.  The record contains no other evidence of private contact with respect to COVID–19 misinformation.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> On this record, it appears that the frequent, intense communications that took place in 2021 had considerably subsided by 2022.  (Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the changed state of the pandemic.)  It is thus very difficult for Hines to show that she faces future harm that is traceable to officials in the White House and the Surgeon General’s Office.  Recall the Fifth Circuit’s reasoning regarding traceability for past harms: In the face of a governmental “pressure campaign,” the “platforms’ censorship decisions were likely attributable at least in part to [their] reluctance to risk the adverse legal or regulatory consequences that could result from a refusal to adhere to the government’s directives.”  83 F.&nbsp;4th, at 370.  But in the months leading up to this suit, these officials issued no directives and threatened no consequences.  They only asked for information about the most popular vaccine-related posts.  Hines does not allege that her content has fallen, or is likely to fall, in that category.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; In these circumstances, Hines cannot rely on “the predictable effect of Government action on the decisions of third parties”; rather, she can only “speculat[e] about the decisions of third parties.”  <em>Department of Commerce</em>, 588 U.&nbsp;S., at 768.  It is “no more than conjecture” to assume that Hines will be subject to White House-induced content moderation.  <em>Los Angeles</em> v. <em>Lyons</em>, <a aria-label=\"461 U. S. 95\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/461/95\">461 U.&nbsp;S. 95</a>, 108 (1983).  Hines (along with the other plaintiffs) has therefore failed to establish a likelihood of future injury traceable to the White House or the Surgeon General’s Office.  Likewise, the risk of future harm traceable to the CDC is minimal.  The CDC stopped meeting with the platforms in March 2022.  Thereafter, the platforms sporadically asked the CDC to verify or debunk several claims about vaccines.  But the agency has not received any such message since the summer of 2022.<a aria-label=\"reference 10 of Barrett Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-10\" id=\"OPINION_4-10ref\"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The plaintiffs’ counterarguments do not persuade.  <em>First</em>, they argue that they suffer “continuing, present adverse effects” from their past restrictions, as they must now self-censor on social media.  <em>O’Shea</em>, 414 U.&nbsp;S., at 496.  But the plaintiffs “cannot manufacture standing merely by inflicting harm on themselves based on their fears of hypothetical future harm that is not certainly impending.”  <em>Clapper</em>, 568 U.&nbsp;S., at 416.  And as we explained, the plaintiffs have not shown that they are likely to face a risk of future censorship traceable to the <em>defendants</em>.  Indeed, even before the defendants entered the scene, the plaintiffs “had a similar incentive to engage in” self-censorship, given the platforms’ independent content moderation.  <em>Id</em>., at 417.  So it is “difficult &nbsp;to see how” the plaintiffs’ self-censorship “can be traced to” the defendants.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Second</em>, the plaintiffs and the dissent suggest that the platforms continue to suppress their speech according to policies initially adopted under Government pressure.  <em>Post</em>, at 21.  That may be true.  But the plaintiffs have a redressability problem.  “To determine whether an injury is redressable,” we “consider the relationship between ‘the judicial relief requested’ and the ‘injury’ suffered.”  <em>California </em>v.<em> Texas</em>, <a aria-label=\"593 U. S. 659\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/593/659\">593 U.&nbsp;S. 659</a>, 671 (2021).  The plaintiffs assert several injuries—their past social-media restrictions, current self-censorship, and likely social-media restrictions in the future.  The requested judicial relief, meanwhile, is an injunction stopping certain Government agencies and employees from coercing or encouraging the platforms to suppress speech.  A court <em>could </em>prevent these Government defendants from interfering with the platforms’ independent application of their policies.  But without evidence of continued pressure from the defendants, it appears that the platforms remain free to enforce, or not to enforce, those policies—even those tainted by initial governmental coercion.  The platforms are “not parties to the suit, and there is no reason they should be obliged to honor an incidental legal determination the suit produced.”  <em>Lujan</em>, 504 U.&nbsp;S., at 569 (plurality opinion); see also <em>Haaland </em>v.<em> Brackeen</em>, <a aria-label=\"599 U. S. 255\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/599/255\">599 U.&nbsp;S. 255</a>, 293–294 (2023).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Indeed, the available evidence indicates that the platforms have enforced their policies against COVID–19 misinformation even as the Federal Government has wound down its own pandemic response measures.  For instance, Hines reports that Facebook imposed several restrictions on her vaccine-related posts in the spring of 2023.  Around the same time, in April 2023, President Biden signed a joint resolution that ended the national COVID–19 emergency.  See <a aria-label=\"Pub. L. 118 3\" href=\"/rio/citation/Pub._L._118-3\">Pub. L. 118–3</a>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/137_Stat._6\">137 Stat. 6</a>.  The next month, the White House disbanded its COVID–19 Response Team, which was &nbsp;responsible for many of the challenged communications in this case.  Enjoining the Government defendants, therefore, is unlikely to affect the platforms’ content-moderation decisions.<a aria-label=\"reference 11 of Barrett Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-11\" id=\"OPINION_4-11ref\"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">C</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> We conclude briefly with the plaintiffs’ “right to listen” theory.  The individual plaintiffs claim an interest in reading and engaging with the content of other speakers on social media.  The <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>, they argue, protects that interest.  Thus, the plaintiffs assert injuries based on the restrictions that countless other social-media users have experienced.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This theory is startlingly broad, as it would grant all &nbsp;social-media users the right to sue over <em>someone else’s</em> censorship—at least so long as they claim an interest in that person’s speech.  This Court has “never accepted such a boundless theory of standing.”  <em>Already, LLC </em>v.<em> Nike, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"568 U. S. 85\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/568/85\">568 U.&nbsp;S. 85</a>, 99 (2013).  While we have recognized a “<a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> right to ‘receive information and ideas,’&nbsp;” we &nbsp;have identified a cognizable injury only where the listener has a concrete, specific connection to the speaker.  <em>Kleindienst </em>v.<em> Mandel</em>, <a aria-label=\"408 U. S. 753\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/408/753\">408 U.&nbsp;S. 753</a>, 762 (1972).  For instance, in <em>Mandel</em>, we agreed that a group of professors had a <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> interest in challenging the visa denial of a person they had invited to speak at a conference.  <em>Id</em>., at 762–765.  And in <em>Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy </em>v.<em> Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc.</em>, we concluded that prescription-drug consumers had an interest in challenging the prohibition on advertising the price of those drugs.  <a aria-label=\"425 U. S. 748\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/425/748\">425 U.&nbsp;S. 748</a>, 756–757 (1976).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Attempting to satisfy this requirement, the plaintiffs emphasize that hearing unfettered speech on social media is critical to their work as scientists, pundits, and activists.  But they do not point to any specific instance of content moderation that caused them identifiable harm.  They have therefore failed to establish an injury that is sufficiently “concrete and particularized.”  <em>Lujan</em>, 504 U.&nbsp;S., at 560.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The state plaintiffs, claiming their own version of the “right to listen” theory, assert a sovereign interest in hearing from their citizens on social media.  See 83 F.&nbsp;4th, at 372–373.  But this theory suffers from the same flaws as the individual plaintiffs’ theory.  The States have not identified any specific speakers or topics that they have been unable to hear or follow.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The States cite this supposed sovereign injury as a basis for asserting third-party standing on behalf of “the citizens they would listen to.”  Brief for Respondents 30.  But “[t]his argument is a thinly veiled attempt to circumvent the limits on <em>parens patriae</em> standing.”  <em>Brackeen</em>, 599 U.&nbsp;S., at 295, n.&nbsp;11.  Namely, States do not have “&nbsp;‘standing as <em>parens patriae </em>to bring an action against the Federal Government.’&nbsp;”  <em>Id</em>., at 295.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The States, like the individual plaintiffs, have failed to establish a likelihood of standing.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">&nbsp;*  *  *</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The plaintiffs, without any concrete link between their injuries and the defendants’ conduct, ask us to conduct a review of the years-long communications between dozens of federal officials, across different agencies, with different social-media platforms, about different topics.

The Fifth Circuit removed these entities and individuals from the injunction, however, so they are not before us.  <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Biden</em>, 83 F.&nbsp;4th 350, 391 (2023).</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-3\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Barrett Opinion at reference 3\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-3ref\">3</a> &nbsp;Because we do not reach the merits, we express no view as to whether the Fifth Circuit correctly articulated the standard for when the Government transforms private conduct into state action.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-4\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Barrett Opinion at reference 4\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-4ref\">4</a> &nbsp;The Fifth Circuit relied on the District Court’s factual findings, many of which unfortunately appear to be clearly erroneous.  The District Court found that the defendants and the platforms had an “efficient report-and-censor relationship.”  <em>Missouri </em>v.<em> Biden</em>, 680 F.&nbsp;Supp. 3d 630, 715 (WD La. 2023).  But much of its evidence is inapposite.  For instance, the court says that Twitter set up a “streamlined process for censorship requests” after the White House “bombarded” it with such requests.  <em>Ibid</em>., n. 662 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The record it cites says nothing about “censorship requests.”  See App. 639–642.  Rather, in response to a White House official asking Twitter to remove an impersonation account of President Biden’s granddaughter, Twitter told the official about a portal that he could use to flag similar issues.  <em>Ibid</em>.  This has nothing to do with COVID–19 misinformation.  The court also found that “[a] drastic increase in censorship .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. directly coincided with Defendants’ public calls for censorship and private demands for censorship.”  680 F.&nbsp;Supp. 3d, at 715.  As to the “calls for censorship,” the court’s proof included statements from Members of Congress, who are not parties to this suit.  <em>Ibid</em>., and n. 658.  Some of the evidence of the “increase in censorship” reveals that Facebook worked with the CDC to update its list of removable false claims, but these examples do not suggest that the agency “demand[ed]” that it do so.  <em>Ibid.  </em>Finally, the court, echoing the plaintiffs’ proposed statement of facts, erroneously stated that Facebook agreed to censor content that did not violate its policies.  <em>Id</em>., at 714, n.&nbsp;655.  Instead, on several occasions, Facebook explained that certain content did not qualify for <em>removal</em> under its policies but did qualify for other forms of moderation.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-5\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Barrett Opinion at reference 5\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-5ref\">5</a> &nbsp;The Fifth Circuit held that States “sustain a direct injury when the social-media accounts of state officials are censored due to federal coercion.”  83 F. 4th, at 372.  Because the State failed to show that its official was censored, we need not express a view on this theory.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-6\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Barrett Opinion at reference 6\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-6ref\">6</a> &nbsp;Hines tries to link this restriction to the Surgeon General’s Office as well, suggesting that the White House and Surgeon General together pressured Facebook.  But the record reveals that a White House official sent the relevant email, and Facebook responded only to White House officials.  The Surgeon General’s Office was seemingly uninvolved.  Thus, Hines cannot demonstrate that her past restriction is traceable to the Surgeon General’s Office.  The plaintiffs do not attempt to draw any other connections between their restrictions and the Surgeon General’s Office.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-7\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Barrett Opinion at reference 7\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-7ref\">7</a> &nbsp;The dissent does not dispute the Court’s assessment of these asserted links.  Instead, the dissent draws links that Hines herself has not set forth, often based on injuries that Hines never claimed.  Compare <em>post</em>, at 19–20, with Brief for Respondents 19–20; App. 628–632.  For instance, the dissent says that in May 2021, Facebook began demoting content from accounts that repeatedly shared misinformation, purportedly due to White House pressure.  <em>Post</em>, at 10, 19.  Because Facebook frequently fact checked Hines’ posts, the dissent simply assumes<em> </em>(without citing Hines’ declarations) that her content was subsequently hidden from her friends’ feeds.  <em>Post</em>, at 19.  Likewise, pointing to an August 2021 policy change, the dissent concludes that the mid-July 2021 deplatforming of one of Hines’ groups rendered her other pages “non-recommendable.”  <em>Ibid</em>.  Hines, however, never claimed as much—and the <em>plaintiffs</em> bear the burden to establish standing by setting forth “specific facts.”  <em>Lujan </em>v. <em>Defenders of Wildlife</em>, <a aria-label=\"504 U.

It is especially important to hold the plaintiffs to their burden in a case like this one, where the record spans over 26,000 pages and the lower courts did not make any specific causation findings.  As the Seventh Circuit has memorably put it, “[j]udges are not like pigs, hunting for truffles buried [in the record].”  <em>Gross </em>v.<em> Cicero</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/619_F.3d_697\">619 F.&nbsp;3d 697</a>, 702 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-8\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Barrett Opinion at reference 8\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-8ref\">8</a> &nbsp;By acknowledging the real possibility that Facebook acted independently in suppressing Hines’ content, we are not applying a “new and heightened standard,” as the dissent claims.  <em>Post</em>, at 20.  The whole purpose of the traceability requirement is to ensure that “in fact, the asserted injury was the consequence of the defendants’ actions,” rather than of “the independent action” of a third party.  <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization</em>, <a aria-label=\"426 U. S. 26\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/426/26\">426 U.&nbsp;S. 26</a>, 42, 45 (1976).  Nor is our analysis inconsistent with <em>Department of Commerce </em>v. <em>New York</em>, <a aria-label=\"588 U.S. 752\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/588/752\">588 U.&nbsp;S. 752 (2019)</a>.  See <em>post</em>, at 19.  There, the plaintiffs, including several States, challenged the Secretary of Commerce’s decision to reinstate a citizenship question on the census.  588 U.&nbsp;S., at 761, 764.  They argued that this question would make noncitizens less likely to respond to the census, leading to an inaccurate population count and the concomitant loss of congressional seats and federal funding.  <em>Id</em>., at 766–767.  The plaintiffs’ injuries thus depended on the actions of third parties.  <em>Id</em>., at 767–768.  The District Court found that noncitizens had historically responded at lower rates than citizens to previous versions of the census (and other surveys) that included a citizenship question and that noncitizens were disproportionately likely to stop responding to those questionnaires once they reached the citizenship question.  <em>New York </em>v.<em> United States Dept. of Commerce</em>, 351 F.&nbsp;Supp. 3d 502, 578–579 (SDNY 2019).  Crediting those findings, this Court concluded that the plaintiffs “met their burden of showing that third parties will likely react in predictable ways to the citizenship question<em>.</em>”  <em>Department of Commerce</em>, 588 U.&nbsp;S., at 768.  The dissent suggests that it “would have been difficult for [the plaintiffs] to determine which noncitizen households failed to respond to the census because of a citizenship question and which had other reasons.”  <em>Post</em>, at 20.  But the evidence made clear that the <em>citizenship question</em> drove noncitizens’ lower response rates; the District Court made no findings about noncitizens’ response rates to the census generally.  Here, by contrast, the evidence is murky.  Facebook targeted Hines’ posts (and others like hers) before the White House entered the picture, meaning that Facebook had independent incentives to restrict Hines’ content.  It is therefore difficult to say that the White House was responsible (even in part) for all of Hines’ later restrictions—<em>especially</em> absent clear links between White House content-moderation requests to Facebook and Facebook’s actions toward Hines.  Cf. <em>post</em>, at 21.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-9\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Barrett Opinion at reference 9\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-9ref\">9</a> &nbsp;According to a declaration submitted by the Surgeon General’s Chief of Staff, no one in that office met with the platforms to discuss their submissions “or otherwise had substantive communications with social media companies about the RFI.”  61 Record 19,480.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-10\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Barrett Opinion at reference 10\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-10ref\">10</a> &nbsp;The dissent claims that the future injury prong is satisfied because Facebook continued to censor Hines at the time of her complaint and thereafter.  <em>Post</em>, at 17.  But the dissent gives short shrift to the key point: By the time Hines filed suit in August 2022, the White House was no longer engaged in any sort of “pressure campaign” toward Facebook.  (Note that the dissent, in its 10-page recounting of the record, devotes only one paragraph to the events of 2022.  <em>Post</em>, at 14.)  Thus, when Hines sued, it was unlikely that Facebook’s actions were fairly traceable to the White House at the time—or would be going forward.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-11\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Barrett Opinion at reference 11\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-11ref\">11</a> &nbsp;As with traceability, the dissent is wrong to claim that we are applying a “new and elevated standard for redressability.”  <em>Post</em>, at 22.  Far from holding plaintiffs to a “certainty” standard, <em>ibid</em>., we simply conclude that an injunction against the Government defendants is <em>unlikely </em>to stop the platforms from suppressing the plaintiffs’ speech.  And while traceability and redressability are “&nbsp;‘<em>often</em> “flip sides of the same coin,”&nbsp;’&nbsp;” <em>post</em>, at 22 (quoting <em>FDA </em>v.<em> Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine</em>, <a aria-label=\"602 U. S. 367\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/602/367\">602 U.&nbsp;S. 367</a>, 380 (2024); emphasis added), that is not<em> always</em> the case.  Facebook might continue to remove Hines’ posts under a policy that it adopted at the White House’s behest (thus satisfying traceability).  But if the White House officials have already abandoned their pressure campaign, enjoining them is unlikely to prompt Facebook to stop enforcing the policy (thus failing redressability).  Finally, by invoking <em>Massachusetts </em>v.<em> EPA</em>, it is the <em>dissent</em> that applies a new and loosened standard for redressability.  <em>Post</em>, at 22.  In that case, we explained that <em>state</em> plaintiffs are “entitled to special solicitude” when it comes to standing, and we conducted our analysis accordingly.  <a aria-label=\"549 U.

Victims of the campaign perceived by the lower courts brought this action to ensure that the Government did not continue to coerce social media platforms to suppress speech.  Among these victims were two States, whose public health officials were hampered in their ability to share their expertise with state residents; distinguished professors of medicine at Stanford and Harvard; a professor of psychiatry at the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine; the owner and operator of a news website; and Jill Hines, the director of a consumer and human rights advocacy organization.  All these victims simply wanted to speak out on a question of the utmost public importance.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> To protect their right to do so, the District Court issued a preliminary injunction, App. 278–285, and the Court of Appeals found ample evidence to support injunctive relief.  See <em>Missouri</em> v. <em>Biden</em>, 83 F. 4th 350 (CA5 2023).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> If the lower courts’ assessment of the voluminous record is correct, this is one of the most important free speech cases &nbsp;to reach this Court in years.  Freedom of speech serves many valuable purposes, but its most important role is protection of speech that is essential to democratic self-government, see <em>Snyder</em> v. <em>Phelps</em>, <a aria-label=\"562 U. S. 443\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/562/443\">562 U.&nbsp;S. 443</a>, 451–452 (2011), and speech that advances humanity’s store of knowledge, thought, and expression in fields such as science, medicine, history, the social sciences, philosophy, and the arts, see <em>United States</em> v. <em>Alvarez</em>, <a aria-label=\"567 U. S. 709\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/567/709\">567 U.&nbsp;S. 709</a>, 751 (2012) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Alito</span>, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The speech at issue falls squarely into those categories.  It concerns the COVID–19 virus, which has killed more than a million Americans.<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-1\" id=\"DISSENT_5-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a>  Our country’s response to the COVID–19 pandemic was and remains a matter of enormous medical, social, political, geopolitical, and economic importance, and our dedication to a free marketplace of ideas demands that dissenting views on such matters be allowed.  I assume that a fair portion of what social media users had to say about COVID–19 and the pandemic was of little lasting value.  Some was undoubtedly untrue or misleading, and some may have been downright dangerous.  But we now know that valuable speech was also suppressed.<a aria-label=\"reference 2 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-2\" id=\"DISSENT_5-2ref\"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a>  That is what inevitably happens when entry to &nbsp;the marketplace of ideas is restricted.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Of course, purely private entities like newspapers are not subject to the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>, and as a result, they may publish or decline to publish whatever they wish.  But government officials may not coerce private entities to suppress speech, see <em>National Rifle Association of America </em>v.<em> Vullo</em>, <a aria-label=\"602 U.S. 175\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/602/175\">602 U.&nbsp;S. 175 (2024)</a>, and that is what happened in this case.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The record before us is vast.  It contains evidence of communications between many different government actors and a variety of internet platforms, as well as evidence regarding the effects of those interactions on the seven different plaintiffs.  For present purposes, however, I will focus on (a) just a few federal officials (namely, those who worked either in the White House or the Surgeon General’s office), (b) only one of the most influential social media platforms, Facebook, and (c) just one plaintiff, Jill Hines, because if any of the plaintiffs has standing, we are obligated to reach the merits of this case.  See <em>Rumsfeld </em>v. <em>Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"547 U. S. 47\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/547/47\">547 U.&nbsp;S. 47</a>, 52, n.&nbsp;2 (2006).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> With the inquiry focused in this way, here is what the &nbsp;record plainly shows.  For months in 2021 and 2022, a coterie of officials at the highest levels of the Federal Government continuously harried and implicitly threatened Facebook with potentially crippling consequences if it did not comply with their wishes about the suppression of certain COVID–19-related speech.  Not surprisingly, Facebook repeatedly yielded.  As a result Hines was indisputably injured, and due to the officials’ continuing efforts, she was threatened with more of the same when she brought suit.  These past and threatened future injuries were caused by and traceable to censorship that the officials coerced, and the injunctive relief she sought was an available and suitable remedy.  This evidence was more than sufficient to establish Hines’s standing to sue, see <em>Lujan</em> v. <em>Defenders of Wildlife</em>, <a aria-label=\"504 U. S. 555\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/504/555\">504 U.&nbsp;S. 555</a>, 561–562 (1992), and consequently, we are obligated to tackle the free speech issue that the case presents.  The Court, however, shirks that duty and thus permits the successful campaign of coercion in this case to stand as an attractive model for future officials who want to control what the people say, hear, and think.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> That is regrettable.  What the officials did in this case was more subtle than the ham-handed censorship found to be unconstitutional in<em> Vullo</em>, but it was no less coercive.  And because of the perpetrators’ high positions, it was even more dangerous. It was blatantly unconstitutional, and the country may come to regret the Court’s failure to say so.  Officials who read today’s decision together with <em>Vullo </em>will get the message.  If a coercive campaign is carried out with enough sophistication, it may get by.  That is not a message this Court should send.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In the next section of this opinion, I will recount in some detail what was done by the officials in this case, but in considering the coercive impact of their conduct, two prominent facts must be kept in mind.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> First, social media have become a leading source of news &nbsp;for many Americans,<a aria-label=\"reference 3 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-3\" id=\"DISSENT_5-3ref\"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></a> and with the decline of other media, their importance may grow.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Second, internet platforms, although rich and powerful, are at the same time far more vulnerable to Government pressure than other news sources.  If a President dislikes a particular newspaper, he (fortunately) lacks the ability to put the paper out of business.  But for Facebook and many other social media platforms, the situation is fundamentally different.  They are critically dependent on the protection provided by §230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, <a aria-label=\"47 USC 230\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230\">47 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §230</a>, which shields them from civil liability for content they spread.  They are vulnerable to antitrust actions; indeed, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has described a potential antitrust lawsuit as an “existential” threat to his company.<a aria-label=\"reference 4 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-4\" id=\"DISSENT_5-4ref\"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup></a>  And because their substantial overseas operations may be subjected to tough regulation in the European Union and other foreign jurisdictions, they rely on the Federal Government’s diplomatic efforts to protect their interests.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> For these and other reasons,<a aria-label=\"reference 5 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-5\" id=\"DISSENT_5-5ref\"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup></a> internet platforms have a powerful incentive to please important federal officials, and the record in this case shows that high-ranking officials &nbsp;skillfully exploited Facebook’s vulnerability.  When Facebook did not heed their requests as quickly or as fully as the officials wanted, the platform was publicly accused of “killing people” and subtly threatened with retaliation.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Not surprisingly these efforts bore fruit.  Facebook adopted new rules that better conformed to the officials’ wishes, and many users who expressed disapproved views about the pandemic or COVID–19 vaccines were “deplatformed” or otherwise injured.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">I</h3>\n<h4 class=\"jy-center\">A</h4>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> I begin by recounting the White House-led campaign to coerce Facebook.  The story starts in early 2021, when White House officials began communicating with Facebook about the spread of misinformation about COVID–19 on its platform.  Their emails started as questions, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., “Can you also give us a sense of misinformation that might be falling outside of your removal polices?”  10 Record 3397.  But when the White House did not get the results it wanted, its questions quickly turned to virtual demands.  And sometimes, those statements were paired with explicit references to potential consequences.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> We may begin this account with an exchange that occurred in March 2021, when the Washington Post reported that Facebook was conducting a study that examined whether posts on the platform questioning COVID–19’s severity or the vaccines’ efficacy dissuaded some Americans from being vaccinated.<a aria-label=\"reference 6 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-6\" id=\"DISSENT_5-6ref\"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup></a>  The study noted that Facebook’s rules permitted some of this content to circulate.  Rob Flaherty, the White House Director of Digital Strategy, promptly emailed Facebook about the report.  The subject &nbsp;line of his email contained this accusation: “You are hiding the ball.”  30 <em>id</em>., at 9366.<em> </em>Flaherty noted that the White House was “gravely concerned that [Facebook] is one of the top drivers of vaccine hesitancy,” and he demanded to know how Facebook was trying to solve the problem.  <em>Id</em>., at 9365.  In his words, “we want to know that you’re trying, we want to know how we can help, and we want to know that you’re not playing a shell game with us when we ask you what is going on.”  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Andy Slavitt, the White House Senior Advisor for the COVID–19 Response, chimed in with similar complaints.  “[R]elative to othe[r]” platforms, he said, “interactions with Facebook are not straightforward” even though the misinformation problems there, in his view, were “worse.”  <em>Id</em>., at 9364.  According to Slavitt, the White House did not believe that Facebook was “trying to solve the problem,” so he informed Facebook that “[i]nternally we have been considering our options on what to do about it.”  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Facebook responded apologetically to this and other missives.  It acknowledged that “[w]e obviously have work to do to gain your trust.”  <em>Id</em>., at 9365.  And after a follow-up conversation, the platform promised Flaherty and Slavitt that it would adopt additional policies to “reduc[e] virality of vaccine hesitancy content.”  <em>Id</em>., at 9369.  In particular, Facebook promised to “remove [any] Groups, Pages, and Accounts” that “disproportionately promot[e] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sensationalized content” about the risks of vaccines, even though it acknowledged that user stories about their experiences and those of family members or friends were “ofte[n] true.”  <em>Ibid.</em>  Facebook also promised to share additional data with the White House,<em> ibid</em>.,<em> </em>but Flaherty was not fully satisfied.  He said that the additional data Facebook offered was not “going to get us the info we’re looking for,” but “it shows to me that you at least understand the ask.”  <em>Id</em>., at 9368.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In April, Flaherty again demanded information on the &nbsp;“actions and changes” Facebook was taking “to ensure you’re not making our country’s vaccine hesitancy problem worse.”  <em>Id</em>., at 9371.  To emphasize his urgency, Flaherty likened COVID–19 misinformation to misinformation that led to the January 6 attack on the Capitol.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Facebook, he charged, had helped to “increase skepticism” of the 2020 election, and he claimed that “an insurrection .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. was plotted, in large part, on your platform.”  <em>Ibid</em>.  He added: “I want some assurances, based in data, that you are not doing the same thing again here.”  <em>Ibid.  </em>Facebook was surprised by these remarks because it “thought we were doing a better job” communicating with the White House, but it promised to “more clearly respon[d]” in the future.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The next week, Facebook officers spoke with Slavitt and Flaherty about reports of a rare blood clot caused by the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.  <em>Id</em>., at 9385.  The conversation quickly shifted when the White House noticed that one of the most-viewed vaccine-related posts from the past week was a Tucker Carlson video questioning the efficacy of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.  <em>Id</em>., at 9376, 9388.  Facebook informed the White House that the video did not “qualify for removal under our policies” and thus would be demoted instead, <em>ibid.</em>, but that answer did not please Flaherty.  “How was this not violative?” he queried, and “[w]hat exactly is the rule for removal vs demoting?”  <em>Id</em>., at 9387.  Then, for the second time in a week, he invoked the January 6 attack: “Not for nothing, but last time we did this dance, it ended in an insurrection.”  <em>Id</em>., at 9388.  When Facebook did not respond promptly, he made his demand more explicit: “These questions weren’t rhetorical.”  <em>Id</em>., at 9387<em>.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> If repeated accusations that Facebook aided an insurrection did not sufficiently convey the White House’s displeasure, Flaherty and Slavitt made sure to do so by phone.<a aria-label=\"reference 7 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-7\" id=\"DISSENT_5-7ref\"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup></a>  In &nbsp;one call, both officials chided Facebook for not being “straightforward” and not “play[ing] ball.”  Committee Report 141–142.  Flaherty also informed Facebook that he was reporting on the COVID–19 misinformation problem to the President.  <em>Id</em>., at 136.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> After a second call, a high-ranking Facebook executive perceived that Slavitt was “outraged—not too strong a word to describe his reaction”—that the platform had not removed a fast-spreading meme suggesting that the vaccines might cause harm.  <em>Id</em>., at 295.  The executive had “countered that removing content like that would represent a significant incursion into traditional boundaries of free expression in the US,” but Slavitt was unmoved, in part because he presumed that other platforms “would never accept something like this.”  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> A few weeks later, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki was asked at a press conference about Facebook’s decision to keep former President Donald Trump off the platform.  See Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jen Psaki and Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack (May 5, 2021) (hereinafter May 5 Press Briefing).<a aria-label=\"reference 8 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-8\" id=\"DISSENT_5-8ref\"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup></a>  Psaki deflected that question but took the opportunity to call on platforms like Facebook to “&nbsp;‘stop amplifying untrustworthy content .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. , especially related to COVID–19, vaccinations, and elections.’&nbsp;”  78 Record 25170.  In the same breath, Psaki reminded the platforms that President Biden “&nbsp;‘supports .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a robust anti-trust program.’&nbsp;”  <em>Id</em>., at 25171 (emphasis deleted); May 5 Press Briefing.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Around this same time, Flaherty and Slavitt were in-&nbsp;terrogating Facebook on the mechanics of its content-&nbsp;moderation rules for COVID–19 misinformation.  30 Record &nbsp;9391, 9397.  Flaherty also forwarded to Facebook a “COVID–19 Vaccine Misinformation Brief&nbsp;” that had been drafted by outside researchers and was “informing thinking” in the White House on what Facebook’s policies should be.  52 <em>id</em>., at 16186.  This document recommended that Facebook strengthen its efforts against misinformation in several ways.  It recommended the adoption of “progressively severe penalties” for accounts that repeatedly posted misinformation, and it proposed that Facebook make it harder for users to find “anti-vaccine or vaccine-hesitant propaganda” from other users.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Facebook declined to adopt some of these suggestions immediately, but it did “se[t] up more dedicated monitoring for [COVID] vaccine content” and adopted a policy of “stronger demotions [for] a broader set of content.”  30 <em>id</em>., at 9396.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The White House responded with more questions.  Acknowledging that he sounded “like a broken record,” Flaherty interrogated Facebook about “how much content is being demoted, and how effective [Facebook was] at mitigating reach, and how quickly.”  <em>Id</em>., at 9395.  Later, Flaherty chastised Facebook for failing to prevent some &nbsp;vaccine-hesitant content from showing up through the platform’s search function.  <em>Id</em>., at 9400.  “&nbsp;‘[R]emoving bad information from search’ is one of the easy, low-bar things you guys do to make people like me think you’re taking action,” he said.  <em>Id</em>., at 9399.  “If you’re not getting <em>that </em>right, it raises even more questions about the higher bar stuff.”  <em>Ibid</em>.  A few weeks after this latest round of haranguing, Facebook expanded penalties for individual Facebook accounts that repeatedly shared content that fact-checkers deemed misinformation; henceforth, all of those individuals’ posts would show up less frequently in their friends’ news feeds.  See 9 <em>id</em>., at 2697; Facebook, Taking Action Against People Who Repeatedly Share Misinformation &nbsp;(May 26, 2021).<a aria-label=\"reference 9 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-9\" id=\"DISSENT_5-9ref\"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Perhaps the most intense period of White House pressure began a short time later.  On July 15, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy released an advisory titled “Confronting Health Misinformation.”  78 Record 25171, 25173.  Dr. Murthy suggested, among other things, algorithmic changes to demote misinformation and additional consequences for misinformation “&nbsp;‘super-spreaders.’&nbsp;”  U.&nbsp;S. Public Health Service, Confronting Health Misinformation: The U.&nbsp;S. Surgeon General’s Advisory on Building a Healthy Information Environment 12 (2021).<a aria-label=\"reference 10 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-10\" id=\"DISSENT_5-10ref\"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup></a>  Dr. Murthy also joined Psaki at a press conference, where he asked the platforms to take “much, much more .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. aggressive action” to combat COVID–19 misinformation “because it’s costing people their lives.”  Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jen Psaki and Surgeon General Dr. Vivek H. Murthy (July 15, 2021).<a aria-label=\"reference 11 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-11\" id=\"DISSENT_5-11ref\"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> At the same press conference, Psaki singled out Facebook as a primary driver of misinformation and asked the platform to make several changes.  Facebook “should provide, publicly and transparently, data on the reach of COVID–19 [and] COVID vaccine misinformation.”  <em>Ibid.</em>  It “needs to move more quickly to remove harmful, violative posts.”  <em>Ibid.</em>  And it should change its algorithm to promote “quality information sources.”  <em>Ibid.</em>  These recommendations echoed Slavitt’s and Flaherty’s private demands from the preceding months—as Psaki herself acknowledged.  The White House “engage[s] with [Facebook] regularly,” she said, and Facebook “certainly understand[s] what our asks &nbsp;are.”  <em>Ibid.  </em>Apparently, the White House had not gotten everything it wanted from those private conversations, so it was turning up the heat in public.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Facebook responded by telling the press that it had partnered with the White House to counter misinformation and  that it had “removed accounts that repeatedly break the rules” and “more than 18 million pieces of COVID misinformation.”  78 Record 25174.  But at another press briefing the next day, Psaki said these efforts were “[c]learly not” sufficient and expressed confidence that Facebook would “make decisions about additional steps they can take.”  See <em>id</em>., at 25175; Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jen Psaki (July 16, 2021).<a aria-label=\"reference 12 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-12\" id=\"DISSENT_5-12ref\"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> That same day, President Biden told reporters that social media platforms were “&nbsp;‘killing people’&nbsp;” by allowing COVID-related misinformation to circulate.  78 Record 25174, 25212.  At oral argument, the Government suggested that the President later disclaimed any desire to hold the platforms accountable for misinformation, Tr. of Oral Arg. 34–35, but that is not so.  The President’s so-called clarification, like many other statements by Government officials, called on “&nbsp;‘Facebook’&nbsp;” to “&nbsp;‘do something about the misinformation’&nbsp;” on its platform.  B. Klein, M. Vazquez, &amp; K. Collins, Biden Backs Away From His Claim That Facebook Is ‘Killing People’ by Allowing COVID Misinformation, CNN (July 19, 2021).<a aria-label=\"reference 13 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-13\" id=\"DISSENT_5-13ref\"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> And far from disclaiming potential regulatory action, the White House confirmed that it had <em>not</em> “&nbsp;‘taken any options off the table.’&nbsp;”  <em>Ibid.</em>  In fact, the day after the President’s supposed clarification, the White House Communications Director commended the President for “speak[ing] very aggressively” and affirmed that platforms “certainly .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &nbsp;should be held accountable” for publishing misinformation.  61 Record 19400–19401.  Indeed, she said that the White House was “reviewing” whether §230 should be amended to open the platforms to suit.  <em>Id</em>., at 19400.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Facebook responded quickly.  The same day the President made his “killing people” remark, the platform reached out to Dr. Murthy to determine “the scope of what the White House expects from us on misinformation going forward.”  9 <em>id</em>., at 2690.  The next day, Facebook asked officials about how to “get back to a good place” with the White House.  30 <em>id</em>., at 9403.  And soon after, Facebook sent an email saying that it “hear[d]” the officials’ “call for us to do more,” and promptly assured the White House that it would comply.  9 <em>id</em>., at 2706.  In spite of the White House’s inflammatory rhetoric, Facebook at all times went out of its way to strike a conciliatory tone.  Only two days after the President’s remark—and before his supposed clarification—Facebook assured Dr. Murthy that, though “it’s not great to be accused of killing people,” Facebook would “find a way to deescalate and work together collaboratively.”  <em>Id</em>., at 2713.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Concrete changes followed in short order.  In early August, the Surgeon General’s Office reached out to Facebook for “an update of any new/additional steps you are taking with respect to health misinformation in light of&nbsp;” the July 15 advisory.  <em>Id</em>., at 2703.  In response, Facebook informed the Surgeon General that it would soon “expan[d] [its] COVID policies to further reduce the spread of potentially harmful content.”  <em>Id</em>., at 2701.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> White House-Facebook conversations about misinformation did not end there.  In September, the Wall Street Journal wrote about the spread of misinformation on Facebook, and Facebook preemptively reached out to the White House to clarify.  8 <em>id</em>., at 2681.  Flaherty asked (again) for information on “how big the problem is, what solutions you’re implementing, and how effective they’ve been.”  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; Then in October, the Washington Post published yet another story suggesting that Facebook knew more than it let on about the spread of misinformation.  Flaherty emailed the link to Facebook with the subject line: “not even sure what to say at this point.”  <em>Id</em>., at 2676.  And the Surgeon General’s Office indicated both publically and privately that it was disappointed in Facebook.  See @Surgeon_General, X (Oct. 29, 2021) (accusing Facebook of “lacking .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. transparency and accountability”);<a aria-label=\"reference 14 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-14\" id=\"DISSENT_5-14ref\"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup></a> 9 Record 2708.  Facebook offered to speak with both the White House and the Surgeon General’s Office to assuage concerns.  8 <em>id</em>., at 2676.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Interactions related to COVID–19 misinformation continued until at least June 2022.  <em>Id</em>., at 2663.  At that point, Facebook proposed discontinuing its reports on misinformation, but assured the White House that it would be “happy to continue, or to pick up at a later date, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if we hear from you that this continues to be of value.”  <em>Ibid.</em>  Flaherty asked Facebook to continue reporting on misinformation because the Government was preparing to roll out COVID–19 vaccines for children under five years old and, “[o]bviously,” that rollout “ha[d] the potential to be just as charged” as other vaccine-related controversies.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Flaherty added that he “[w]ould love to get a sense of what you all are planning here,” and Facebook agreed to provide information for as long as necessary.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> What these events show is that top federal officials continuously and persistently hectored Facebook to crack down on what the officials saw as unhelpful social media posts, including not only posts that they thought were false or misleading but also stories that they did not claim to be literally false but nevertheless wanted obscured.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., 30 <em>id</em>., at 9361, 9365, 9369, 9385–9388.  And Facebook’s reactions to these efforts were not what one would expect from &nbsp;an independent news source or a journalistic entity dedicated to holding the Government accountable for its actions.  Instead, Facebook’s responses resembled that of a subservient entity determined to stay in the good graces of a powerful taskmaster.  Facebook told White House officials that it would “work .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to gain your trust.”  <em>Id</em>., at 9365.  When criticized, Facebook representatives whimpered that they “thought we were doing a better job” but promised to do more going forward.  <em>Id</em>., at 9371.  They pleaded to know how they could “get back to a good place” with the White House.  <em>Id</em>., at 9403.  And when denounced as “killing people,” Facebook responded by expressing a desire to “work together collaboratively” with its accuser.  9 <em>id</em>., at 2713; 78 <em>id</em>., at 25174.  The picture is clear.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> While all this was going on, Jill Hines and others were subjected to censorship.  Hines serves as the co-director of Health Freedom Louisiana, an organization that advocated against vaccine and mask mandates during the pandemic.  Over the course of the pandemic—and while the White House was pressuring Facebook—the platform repeatedly censored Hines’s speech.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> For instance, in the summer and fall of 2021, Facebook removed two groups that Hines had formed to discuss the vaccine.  4 <em>id</em>., at 1313–1315.  In January 2022, Facebook restricted posts from Hines’s personal page “for 30 days .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for sharing the image of a display board used in a legislative hearing that had Pfizer’s preclinical trial data on it.”  <em>Id</em>., at 1313.  In late May, Facebook restricted Hines for 90 days for sharing an article about “increased emergency calls for teens with myocarditis following [COVID] vaccination.”  <em>Id</em>., at 1313–1314.  Hines’s public pages, Reopen Louisiana and Health Freedom Louisiana, were subjected to similar treatment.  Facebook’s disciplinary actions meant that both public pages suffered a drop in viewership; as Hines put it, &nbsp;“Each time you build viewership up [on a page], it is knocked back down with each violation.”  <em>Id</em>., at 1314.  And from February to April 2023, Facebook issued warnings and violations for several vaccine-related posts shared on Hines’s personal and public pages, including a post by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and an article entitled “&nbsp;‘Some Americans Shouldn’t Get Another COVID-19 Vaccine Shot, FDA Says.’&nbsp;”  78 <em>id</em>., at 25503–25506.  The result was that “[n]o one else was permitted to view or engage with the[se] post[s].”  <em>Id</em>., at 25503.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">II</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Hines and the other plaintiffs in this case brought this suit and asked for an injunction to stop the censorship campaign just described.  To maintain that suit, they needed to show that they (1) were imminently threatened with an injury in fact (2) that is traceable to the defendants and (3) that could be redressed by the court.  <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.&nbsp;S., at 560–561; <em>O’Shea</em> v. <em>Littleton</em>, <a aria-label=\"414 U. S. 488\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/414/488\">414 U.&nbsp;S. 488</a>, 496 (1974). Hines satisfied all these requirements.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">A</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> <em>Injury in fact</em>.  Because Hines sought and obtained a preliminary injunction, it was not enough for her to show that she had been injured in the past.  Instead, she had to identify a “real and immediate threat of repeated injury” that existed at the time she sued—that is, on August 2, 2022.  <em>O’Shea</em>, 414 U.&nbsp;S., at 496; see also <em>Friends of the Earth, Inc.</em> v. <em>Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"528 U. S. 167\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/528/167\">528 U.&nbsp;S. 167</a>, 191 (2000); <em>Mollan </em>v. <em>Torrance</em>, 9 Wheat. 537, 539 (1824).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Government concedes that Hines suffered past injury, but it claims that she did not make the showing needed to obtain prospective relief.  See Brief for Petitioners 17.  Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals rejected this argument and found that Hines had shown that &nbsp;she was likely to be censored in the future.  680 F.&nbsp;Supp. 3d, at 713; 83 F. 4th, at 368–369.  We have previously examined such findings under the “clearly erroneous” test.  See <em>Duke Power Co.</em> v. <em>Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"438 U. S. 59\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/438/59\">438 U.&nbsp;S. 59</a>, 77 (1978).  But no matter what test is applied, the record clearly shows that Hines was still being censored when she sued—and that the censorship continued thereafter.  See <em>supra</em>, at 15–16.  That was sufficient to establish the type of injury needed to obtain injunctive relief.  <em>O’Shea</em>, 414 U.&nbsp;S., at 496; see also <em>County of Riverside</em> v. <em>McLaughlin</em>, <a aria-label=\"500 U. S. 44\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/500/44\">500 U.&nbsp;S. 44</a>, 51 (1991).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> <em>Traceability</em>.  To sue the White House officials, Hines had to identify a “causal connection” between the actions of those officials and her censorship.  <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Spear</em>, <a aria-label=\"520 U. S. 154\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/520/154\">520 U.&nbsp;S. 154</a>, 169 (1997).  Hines did not need to prove that it was <em>only </em>because of those officials’ conduct that she was censored.  Rather, as we held in <em>Department of Commerce </em>v. <em>New York</em>, <a aria-label=\"588 U.S. 752\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/588/752\">588 U.&nbsp;S. 752 (2019)</a>, it was enough for her to show that one predictable effect of the officials’ action was that Facebook would modify its censorship policies in a way that affected her<em>.</em> <em>Id</em>., at 768.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Hines easily met that test, and her traceability theory is at least as strong as the State of New York’s in the <em>Department of Commerce</em> case.  There, the State claimed that it would be hurt by a census question about citizenship.  The State predicted that the question would dissuade some noncitizen households from complying with their legal duty to complete the form, and it asserted that this in turn <em>could</em> cause the State to lose a seat in the House of Representatives, as well as federal funds that are distributed on the basis of population.  <em>Id</em>., at 766–767.  Although this theory depended on illegal conduct by third parties and an attenuated chain of causation, the Court found that the State had established traceability.  It was enough, the Court held, &nbsp;that the failure of some aliens to respond to the census was “likely attributable” to the Government’s introduction of a citizenship question.  <em>Id</em>., at 768.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This is not a demanding standard, and Hines made the requisite showing—with room to spare.  Recall that officials from the White House and Surgeon General’s Office repeatedly hectored and implicitly threatened Facebook to suppress speech expressing the viewpoint that Hines espoused.  See <em>supra</em>, at 6–15.  Censorship of Hines was the “predictable effect” of these efforts.  <em>Department of Commerce</em>, 588 U.&nbsp;S., at 768.  Or, to put the point in different terms, Facebook would “likely react in predictable ways” to this unrelenting pressure.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This alone was sufficient to show traceability, but here there is even more direct proof.  On numerous occasions, the White House officials successfully pushed Facebook to tighten its censorship policies, see <em>supra</em>, at 7, 10, 13, and those policies had implications for Hines.<a aria-label=\"reference 15 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-15\" id=\"DISSENT_5-15ref\"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup></a>  First, in March &nbsp;2021, the White House pressured Facebook into implementing a policy of removing accounts that “disproportionately promot[e] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sensationalized content” about vaccines.  <em>Supra</em>, at 7.  Later that year, Facebook removed two of Hines’s groups, which posted about vaccines. <em>Supra</em>, at 15.  And when Hines sued in August 2022, she reported that her personal page was “currently restricted” for sharing vaccine-related content and, thus, that she was “under constant threat of being completely deplatformed.”  4 Record 1314.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Second, in May, Facebook told Slavitt that it would “se[t] up more dedicated monitoring” of vaccine content and apply demotions to “a broader set of content.”  <em>Supra</em>, at 10.  Then, a few weeks later, Facebook also increased demotions of posts by individual Facebook accounts that repeatedly shared misinformation.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Hines says that she was repeatedly fact-checked for posting about the vaccines, see <em>supra</em>, at 15–16; 4 Record 1314, so these policy changes apparently increased the risk that posts from her personal account would have been hidden from her friends’ Facebook feeds.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Third, in response to the July 2021 comments from the White House and the Surgeon General, Facebook made more changes.  <em>Supra</em>, at 13.  And from the details Hines provides about her posting history, this policy change would have affected her.  For one thing, Facebook “rendered ‘non-recommendable’&nbsp;” any page linked to another account that had been “removed” for spreading misinformation about COVID–19.  9 Record 2701.  Hines says that two of her groups were removed for alleged COVID misinformation around this time.  <em>Supra</em>, at 15; 4 Record 1315.  So under the new policy, her other pages would apparently be non-recommendable.  Perhaps for this reason, though Hines attempted to convince members of her deplatformed group to migrate to a substitute group, only about a quarter of its membership made the move before the substitute group too was removed.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; For another, Facebook “increas[ed] the strength of [its] demotions for COVID and vaccine-related content that third party fact checkers rate[d] as ‘Partly False’ or ‘Missing Context.’&nbsp;”  9 <em>id</em>., at 2701.  And Facebook “ma[de] it easier to have Pages/Groups/Accounts demoted for sharing COVID and vaccine-related misinformation by .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. counting content removals” under Facebook’s COVID–19 policies “towards their demotion threshold.”  <em>Ibid.</em>  Under this new policy, Facebook would now consider Hines’s “numerous” community standards violations, 4 <em>id</em>., at 1314, when determining whether to make her posts less accessible to other users.  So, for instance, when Hines received several citations in early 2023, this amendment would have governed Facebook’s decision to “downgrad[e] the visibility of [her] posts in Facebook’s News Feed (thereby limiting its reach to other users).”  78 <em>id</em>., at 25503.  The record here amply shows traceability.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Court reaches the opposite conclusion by applying a new and heightened standard.  The Court notes that Facebook began censoring COVID–19-related misinformation before officials from the White House and the Surgeon General’s Office got involved.  <em>Ante</em>, at 20; see also Brief for Petitioners 18.  And in the Court’s view, that fact makes it difficult to untangle Government-caused censorship from censorship that Facebook might have undertaken anyway.  See <em>ante</em>, at 20.  That may be so, but in the <em>Department of Commerce</em> census case, it also would have been difficult for New York to determine which noncitizen households failed to respond to the census because of a citizenship question and which had other reasons.  Nevertheless, the Court did not require New York to perform that essentially impossible operation because it was clear that a citizenship question would dissuade at least <em>some</em> noncitizen households from responding.  As we explained, “Article III ‘requires no more than <em>de&nbsp;facto</em> causality,’&nbsp;” so a showing that a citizenship question affected some aliens sufficed.  <em>Department of Commerce</em>, 588 U.&nbsp;S., at 768.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Here, it is reasonable to infer (indeed, the inference leaps out from the record) that the efforts of the federal officials affected at least some of Facebook’s decisions to censor Hines.  All of Facebook’s demotion, content-removal, and deplatforming decisions are governed by its policies.<a aria-label=\"reference 16 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-16\" id=\"DISSENT_5-16ref\"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup></a>  So when the White House pressured Facebook to amend some of the policies related to speech in which Hines engaged, those amendments necessarily impacted some of Facebook’s censorship decisions.  Nothing more is needed.  What the Court seems to want are a series of ironclad links—from a particular coercive communication to a particular change in Facebook’s rules or practice and then to a particular adverse action against Hines.  No such chain was required in the <em>Department of Commerce</em> case, and neither should one be demanded here.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In addition to this heightened linkage requirement, the Court argues that Hines lacks standing because the threat of future injury dissipated at some point during summer 2022 when the officials’ pressure campaign tapered off.  <em>Ante,</em> at 25, n.&nbsp;10.  But this argument errs in two critical respects.  First, the <em>effects</em> of the changes the officials coerced persisted.  Those changes controlled censorship decisions before and after Hines sued.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Second, the White House threats did not come with expiration dates, and it would be silly to assume that the threats lost their force merely because White House officials opted not to renew them on a regular basis.  Indeed, the record suggests that Facebook did not feel free to chart its own course when Hines sued; rather, the platform had promised to continue reporting to the White House and remain responsive to its concerns for as long as the officials requested.  <em>Supra</em>, at 14.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; In short, when Hines sued in August 2022, there was still a link between the White House and the injuries she was presently suffering and could reasonably expect to suffer in the future.  That is enough for traceability.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">C</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> <em>Redressability.</em>  Finally, Hines was required to show that the threat of future injury she faced when the complaint was filed “likely would be redressed” by injunctive relief.  <em>FDA </em>v.<em> Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine</em>, <a aria-label=\"602 U. S. 367\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/602/367\">602 U.&nbsp;S. 367</a>, 380 (2024).  This required proof that a preliminary injunction would reduce Hines’s “risk of [future] harm .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <em>to some extent</em>.”  <em>Massachusetts</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, <a aria-label=\"549 U. S. 497\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/549/497\">549 U.&nbsp;S. 497</a>, 526 (2007) (emphasis added).  And as we recently explained, “[t]he second and third standing requirements—causation and redressability—are often ‘flip sides of the same coin.’&nbsp;”<em>  Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine</em>, 602 U.&nbsp;S., at 380.  Therefore, “[i]f a defendant’s action causes an injury, enjoining the action or awarding damages for the action will typically redress that injury.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 381.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Hines easily satisfied that requirement.  For the reasons just explained, there is ample proof that Hines’s past injuries were a “predictable effect” of the Government’s censorship campaign, and the preliminary injunction was likely to prevent the continuation of the harm to at least “some extent.”  <em>Massachusetts </em>v.<em> EPA</em>, 549 U.&nbsp;S., at 526.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Court disagrees because Facebook “remain[s] free to enforce .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. even those [policies] tainted by initial governmental coercion.”  <em>Ante</em>, at 26.  But as with traceability, the Court applies a new and elevated standard for redressability, which has never required plaintiffs to be “<em>certain</em>” that a court order would prevent future harm.  <em>Larson</em> v. <em>Valente</em>, <a aria-label=\"456 U. S. 228\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/456/228\">456 U.&nbsp;S. 228</a>, 243–244, n.&nbsp;15 (1982).  In <em>Massachusetts </em>v.<em> EPA</em>, for example, no one could say that the relief sought—reconsideration by the EPA of its decision not to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases—would actually &nbsp;remedy the Commonwealth’s alleged injuries, such as the loss of land due to rising sea levels.  The Court’s decision did not prevent the EPA from adhering to its prior decision, 549 U.&nbsp;S., at 534–535, and there was no way to know with any degree of certainty that any greenhouse gas regulations that the EPA might eventually issue would prevent the oceans from rising.  Yet the Court found that the redressability requirement was met.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Similarly, in <em>Department of Commerce</em>, no one could say with any certainty that our decision barring a censorship question from the 2020 census questionnaire would prevent New York from losing a seat in the House of Representatives, 588 U.&nbsp;S., at 767, and in fact that result occurred despite our decision.

And because the White House prompted Facebook to amend its censorship policies, Hines’s censorship was, at least in part, caused by the White House and could be redressed by an injunction against the continuation of that conduct.

Earlier this Term, we reaffirmed that important principle in <em>National Rifle Association </em>v. <em>Vullo</em>, 602 U.&nbsp;S., at 187–191.  As we said there, “a government official cannot do indirectly what she is barred from doing directly,” <em>id</em>., at 190, and while an official may forcefully attempt to persuade, “[w]hat she cannot do .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is use the power of the State to punish or suppress disfavored expression,” <em>id</em>., at 188.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In <em>Vullo</em>, the alleged conduct was blunt.  The head of the state commission with regulatory authority over insurance companies allegedly told executives at Lloyd’s directly and in no uncertain terms that she would be “&nbsp;‘less interested’&nbsp;” in punishing the company’s regulatory infractions if it ceased doing business with the National Rifle Association.  <em>Id</em>., at 183.  The federal officials’ conduct here was more &nbsp;subtle and sophisticated.  The message was delivered piecemeal by various officials over a period of time in the form of aggressive questions, complaints, insistent requests, demands, and thinly veiled threats of potentially fatal reprisals.  But the message was unmistakable, and it was duly received.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The principle recognized in <em>Bantam Books</em> and <em>Vullo</em> requires a court to distinguish between permissible persuasion and unconstitutional coercion, and in <em>Vullo</em>, we looked to three leading factors that are helpful in making that determination: (1) the authority of the government officials who are alleged to have engaged in coercion, (2) the nature of statements made by those officials, and (3) the reactions of the third party alleged to have been coerced.  602 U.&nbsp;S., at 189–190, and n.&nbsp;4, 191–194.  In this case, all three factors point to coercion.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">A</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> I begin with the authority of the relevant officials—high-ranking White House officials and the Surgeon General.  High-ranking White House officials presumably speak for and may have the ability to influence the President, and as discussed earlier, a Presidential administration has the power to inflict potentially fatal damage to social media platforms like Facebook.  See <em>supra</em>, at 5.  Facebook appreciates what the White House could do, and President Biden has spoken openly about that power—as he has every right to do.  For instance, he has declared that the “policy of [his] Administration [is] to enforce the antitrust laws to meet the challenges posed by .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the rise of the dominant Internet platforms,” and he has directed the Attorney General and other agency heads to “enforce the antitrust laws .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. vigorously.”  Promoting Competition in the American Economy, <a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/link/cpd/executiveorder/14036\">Executive Order No. 14036</a>, <a aria-label=\"3 CFR\" href=\"/cfr/text/3\">3</a> CFR 609 (2021).<a aria-label=\"reference 19 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-19\" id=\"DISSENT_5-19ref\"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup></a>  He has &nbsp;also floated the idea of amending or repealing §230 of the Communications Decency Act.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., B. Klein, White House Reviewing Section 230 Amid Efforts To Push Social Media Giants To Crack Down on Misinformation, CNN (July 20, 2021)&nbsp;<a aria-label=\"reference 20 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-20\" id=\"DISSENT_5-20ref\"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup></a>; R.

In a data-privacy case brought jointly by the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, Facebook was required “to pay an unprecedented $5 billion civil penalty,” which is “among the largest civil penalties ever obtained by the federal government.” Press Release, Dept. of Justice, Facebook Agrees To Pay $5 Billion and Implement Robust New Protections of User Information in Settlement of Data-Privacy Claims (July 24, 2019).<a aria-label=\"reference 22 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-22\" id=\"DISSENT_5-22ref\"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> A matter that may well have been prominent in Facebook’s thinking during the period in question in this case was a dispute between the United States and the European Union over international data transfers.  In 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the mechanism for transferring data between the European Union and United States because it did not sufficiently protect EU citizens from Federal Government surveillance.  <em>Data Protection Comm’r</em> v. <em>Facebook Ireland Limited</em>, Case C–311/18 (2020).  The EU-U.&nbsp;S. conflict over data privacy hindered Facebook’s international operations, but Facebook could &nbsp;not “resolve [the conflict] on its own.”  N. Clegg &amp; J. Newstead, Our Response to the Decision on Facebook’s EU-US Data Transfers, Meta (May 22, 2023).<a aria-label=\"reference 23 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-23\" id=\"DISSENT_5-23ref\"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup></a>  Rather, the platform relied on the White House to negotiate an agreement that would preserve its ability to maintain its trans-Atlantic operations.

Many of the White House’s emails were “phrased virtually as orders,” <em>Bantam Books</em>, 372 U.&nbsp;S., at 68, and the officials’ frequent follow-ups ensured that they were understood as such, <em>id</em>., at 63.  To take a few examples, after Flaherty read an article about content causing vaccine hesitancy, he demanded “to know that [Facebook was] trying” to combat the issue and “to know that you’re not playing a shell game with us when we ask you what is going on.”  30 Record 9365; see <em>supra</em>, at 7.  The next month, he requested “assurances, based in data,” that Facebook was not “making our country’s vaccine hesitancy problem worse.”  30 Record 9371; see <em>supra</em>, at 7–8.  A week after that, he questioned Facebook about its policies “for removal vs demoting,” and when the platform did not &nbsp;promptly respond, he added: “These questions weren’t rhetorical.”  30 Record 9387; see <em>supra</em>, at 8.  When Facebook provided the White House with some data it asked for, Flaherty thanked Facebook for demonstrating “that you at least understand the ask.”  30 Record 9368; see <em>supra</em>, at 7.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Various comments during the July pressure campaign likewise reveal that the White House and the Surgeon General’s Office expected compliance.  At the press conference announcing the Surgeon General’s recommendations related to misinformation, Psaki noted that the White House “engage[s] with [Facebook] regularly,” and Facebook “certainly understand[s] what our asks are.”  <em>Supra</em>, at 11.  The next day, she expressed confidence that Facebook would “make decisions about additional steps they can take.”  78 Record 25175; see <em>supra</em>, at 12.  And eventually, the Surgeon General’s Office prompted Facebook for “an update of any new/additional steps you are taking with respect to health misinformation in light of&nbsp;” the July 15 advisory.  9 Record 2703; see <em>supra</em>, at 13.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> These demands were coupled with “thinly veiled threats” of legal consequences.  <em>Bantam Books</em>, 372 U.&nbsp;S., at 68.  Three instances stand out.  Early on, when the White House first expressed skepticism that Facebook was effectively combatting misinformation, Slavitt informed the platform that the White House was “considering our options on what to do about it.”  30 Record 9364; see <em>supra</em>, at 7.  In other words, if Facebook did not “solve” its “misinformation” problem, the White House might unsheathe its potent authority. 30 Record 9364<em>.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The threat was made more explicit in May, when Psaki paired a request for platforms to “&nbsp;‘stop amplifying untrustworthy content’&nbsp;” with a reminder that President Biden “&nbsp;‘supports .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a robust anti-trust program.’&nbsp;”  78 <em>id</em>., at 25170–25171 (emphasis deleted); May 5 Press Briefing; see also <em>supra</em>, at 9.  The Government casts this reference to legal consequences as a defense of individual Americans &nbsp;against censorship by the platforms.  See Reply Brief 9.  But Psaki’s full answer undermines that interpretation.  Immediately after noting President Biden’s support for antitrust enforcement, Psaki added, “So his view is that there’s more that needs to be done to ensure that this type of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. life-threatening information is not going out to the American public.”  May 5 Press Briefing.  The natural interpretation is that the White House might retaliate if the platforms allowed free speech, not if they suppressed it.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Finally, in July, the White House asserted that the platforms “should be held accountable” for publishing misinformation.  61 Record 19400; see <em>supra</em>, at 11–13.  The totality of this record—constant haranguing, dozens of demands for compliance, and references to potential consequences—evince “a scheme of state censorship.” <em>Bantam Books</em>, 372 U.&nbsp;S., at 72.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">2</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The Government tries to spin these interactions as fairly benign.  In its telling, Flaherty, Slavitt, and other officials merely “asked the platforms for information” and then “publicly and privately criticized the platforms for what the officials perceived as a .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. failure to live up to the platforms’ commitments.”  Brief for Petitioners 31.  References to consequences, the Government claims, were “fleeting and general” and “cannot plausibly be characterized as coercive threats.”  <em>Id</em>., at 32.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This characterization is not true to what happened.  Slavitt and Flaherty did not simply <em>ask</em> Facebook for information.  They browbeat the platform for months and made it clear that if it did not do more to combat what they saw as misinformation, it might be called to account for its shortcomings.  And as for the supposedly “fleeting” nature of the numerous references to potential consequences, death threats can be very effective even if they are not delivered every day.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; The Government also defends the officials’ actions on the ground that “[t]he President and his senior aides are entitled to speak out on such matters of pressing public concern.”  Reply Brief 11.  According to the Government, the officials were simply using the President’s “bully pulpit” to “inform, persuade, and protect the public.”  Brief for Petitioners 5, 24.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This argument introduces a new understanding of the term “bully pulpit,” which was coined by President Theodore Roosevelt to denote a President’s excellent (<em>i</em>.<em>e</em>., “bully”&nbsp;<a aria-label=\"reference 25 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-25\" id=\"DISSENT_5-25ref\"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup></a>) position (<em>i</em>.<em>e</em>., his “pulpit”) to persuade the public.<a aria-label=\"reference 26 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-26\" id=\"DISSENT_5-26ref\"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup></a>  But Flaherty, Slavitt, and other officials who emailed and telephoned Facebook were not speaking to the public from a figurative pulpit.  On the contrary, they were engaged in a covert scheme of censorship that came to light only after the plaintiffs demanded their emails in discovery and a congressional Committee obtained them by subpoena.  See Committee Report 1–2.  If these communications represented the exercise of the bully pulpit, then everything that top federal officials say behind closed doors to any private citizen must also represent the exercise of the President’s bully pulpit.  That stretches the concept beyond the breaking point.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In any event, the Government is hard-pressed to find any prior example of the use of the bully pulpit to threaten censorship of private speech.  The Government cites four instances in which past Presidents commented publicly about the performance of the media.  President Reagan lauded the media for “tough reporting” on drugs.    Reagan Presidential Library &amp; Museum, Remarks to Media Executives at a &nbsp;White House Briefing on Drug Abuse (Mar. 7, 1988).<a aria-label=\"reference 27 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-27\" id=\"DISSENT_5-27ref\"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup></a>  But he never threatened to do anything to media outlets that were soft on the issue of drugs.  President Theodore Roosevelt “lambasted ‘muck-raking’ journalists” as “&nbsp;‘one of the most potent forces for evil’&nbsp;” and encouraged journalists to speak truth, rather than slander.  Brief for Petitioners 24 (quoting The American Presidency Project, Remarks at the Laying of the Cornerstone of the Office Building of the House of Representatives (Apr. 14, 1906)).<a aria-label=\"reference 28 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-28\" id=\"DISSENT_5-28ref\"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup></a>  But his comment did not threaten any action against the muckrakers, see Goodwin 480–487, and it is unclear what he could have done to them.  President George W. Bush denounced pornography as “debilitating” for “communities, marriages, families, and children.”  Presidential Proclamation &nbsp;No. 7725, <a aria-label=\"3 CFR\" href=\"/cfr/text/3\">3</a> CFR 129 (2003 Comp.).  But he never threatened to take action against pornography that was not “obscene” within the meaning of our precedents.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Government’s last example is a 1915 speech in which President Wilson deplored false reporting that the Japanese were using Turtle Bay, California, as a naval base.  The American Presidency Project, Address at the Associated Press Luncheon in New York City (Apr. 20, 1915).<a aria-label=\"reference 29 of Alito Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-29\" id=\"DISSENT_5-29ref\"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup></a>  Speaking to a gathering of reporters, President Wilson proclaimed: “We ought not to permit that sort of thing to use up the electrical energy of the [telegraph] wires, because its energy is malign, its energy is not of the truth, its energy is mischief.”  <em>Ibid</em>.  Wilson’s comment is best understood as metaphorical and hortatory, not as a legal threat.  And in any event, it is hard to see how he could have brought about censorship of telegraph companies because the Mann-&nbsp;Elkins Act, enacted in 1910, deemed them to be common carriers, and that meant that they were obligated to transmit all messages regardless of content.  See <a href=\"/rio/citation/36_Stat._544\">36 Stat. 544</a>–545; T. Wu, A Brief History of American Telecommunications Regulation, in 5 Oxford International Encyclopedia of Legal History 95 (2007).  Thus, none of these examples justifies the conduct at issue here.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">C</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Finally, Facebook’s responses to the officials’ persistent inquiries, criticisms, and threats show that the platform perceived the statements as something more than mere recommendations.  Time and time again, Facebook responded to an angry White House with a promise to do better in the future.  In March, Facebook attempted to assuage the White House by acknowledging “[w]e obviously have work to do to gain your trust.”  30 Record 9365.  In April, Facebook promised to “more clearly respon[d] to [White House] questions.”  <em>Id</em>., at 9371.  In May, Facebook “committed to addressing the defensive work around misinformation that you’ve called on us to address.”  9 <em>id</em>., at 2698.  In July, Facebook reached out to the Surgeon General after “the President’s remarks about us” and emphasized its efforts “to better understand the scope of what the White House expects from us on misinformation going forward.”  <em>Id</em>., at 2690.  And of course, as we have seen, Facebook repeatedly changed its policies to better address the White House’s concerns.  See <em>supra</em>, at 7, 10, 13.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Government’s primary response is that Facebook occasionally declined to take its suggestions.  Reply Brief 11; see, <em>e.g</em>., <em>supra</em>, at 10.  The implication is that Facebook must have chosen to undertake <em>all</em> of its anti-misinformation efforts entirely of its own accord.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> That is bad logic, and in any event, the record shows otherwise.  It is true that Facebook voluntarily undertook <em>some</em> anti-misinformation efforts and that it declined to make <em>some </em>requested policy changes.  But the interactions recounted above unmistakably show that the White House was insistent that Facebook should do more than it was doing on its own, see, <em>e.g</em>., <em>supra</em>, at 11–12, and Facebook repeatedly yielded—even if it did not always give the White House everything it wanted.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Internal Facebook emails paint a clear picture of subservience.  The platform quickly realized that its “handling of [COVID] misinformation” was “importan[t]” to the White House, so it looked for ways “to be viewed as a trusted, transparent partner” and “avoid .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. public spat[s].”  Committee Report 181, 184, 188.  After the White House blamed Facebook for aiding an insurrection, the platform realized that it was at a “crossroads .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. with the White House.”  <em>Id</em>., at 294.  “Given what is at stake here,” one Facebook employee proposed reevaluating the company’s “internal methods” to “see what further steps we may/may not be able to take.”  <em>Id</em>., at 295.  This reevaluation led to one of Facebook’s policy changes.  See <em>supra</em>, at 8–10.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Facebook again took stock of its relationship with the White House after the President’s accusation that it was “killing people.”  Internally, Facebook saw little merit in many of the White House’s critiques.  One employee labeled the White House’s understanding of misinformation “completely unclear” and speculated that “it’s convenient for them to blame us” “when the vaccination campaign isn’t going as hoped.”  Committee Report 473.  Nonetheless, Facebook figured that its “current course” of “in effect explaining ourselves more fully, but not shifting on where we draw the lines,” is “a recipe for protracted and increasing acrimony with the [White House].”  <em>Id</em>., at 573.  “Given the bigger fish we have to fry with the Administration,” such as the EU-U.&nbsp;S. dispute over “data flows,” that did not “seem like a great place” for Facebook-White House relations “to be.”  <em>Ibid. </em> So the platform was motivated to “explore some moves that we can make to show that we are trying to be &nbsp;responsive.”  <em>Ibid</em>.  That brainstorming resulted in the August 2021 rule changes.  See<em> supra</em>, at 13, 19–20.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In sum, the officials wielded potent authority.  Their communications with Facebook were virtual demands.  And Facebook’s quavering responses to those demands show that it felt a strong need to yield.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> For these reasons, I would hold that Hines is likely to prevail on her claim that the White House coerced Facebook into censoring her speech.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">*  *  *</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> For months, high-ranking Government officials placed unrelenting pressure on Facebook to suppress Americans’ free speech.

First, she says that, at the behest of the White House, Facebook announced new measures to combat misinformation about COVID–19 and the vaccines.  Second, she says that her Facebook pages fell under those policies.  Third, she says that she suffered the penalties imposed by Facebook, such as demotion of her posts and pages.  See 4 Record 1315; 78 <em>id</em>., at 25503.  She may not explicitly say that the policy changes caused the penalties she experienced.  But what theory makes more sense—that a user falling within Facebook’s amended policies was censored under those policies or that something else caused her injury?</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_5-16\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Alito Dissent at reference 16\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-16ref\">16</a> &nbsp;See Meta, Policies, https://transparency.meta.com/policies (last accessed June 19, 2024).</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_5-17\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Alito Dissent at reference 17\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-17ref\">17</a> &nbsp;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/26/nyregion/new-york-census-congress.html.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_5-18\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Alito Dissent at reference 18\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-18ref\">18</a> &nbsp;To obtain a preliminary injunction, Hines was required to establish that she is likely to succeed on the merits, that she would otherwise suffer irreparable harm, and that the equities cut in her favor.  <em>Winter</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"555 U.

When the Environmental Protection Agency sets standards for common air pollutants, States must submit a State Implementation Plan, or SIP, providing for the “implementation, maintenance, and enforcement” of those standards in their jurisdictions.  See <a aria-label=\"42 USC 7410 a 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7410#a_1\">42 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §7410(a)(1)</a>.  Because air currents can carry pollution across state borders, States must also design their plans with neighboring States in mind.  Under the Act’s “Good Neighbor Provision,” state plans must prohibit emissions “in amounts which will .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance by, any other State” of the relevant air-quality standard.  §7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I).  Only if a SIP fails to satisfy the “applicable requirements” of the Act may EPA issue a Federal Implementation Plan, or FIP, for the noncompliant State that fails to correct the deficiencies in its SIP.  §§7410(k)(3), (c)(1).</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-d jy-both indent_l-187 indent_h-187\">  In 2015, EPA revised its air-quality standards for ozone, thus triggering a requirement for States to submit new SIPs.  Years later, EPA announced its intention to disapprove over 20 SIPs because the agency believed they had failed to address adequately obligations under the Good Neighbor Provision.  During the public-comment period for the proposed SIP disapprovals, EPA issued a single proposed FIP to bind &nbsp;all those States.  EPA designed its proposed FIP based on which emissions-control measures would maximize cost-effectiveness in improving ozone levels downwind and on the assumption the FIP would apply to all covered States.  Commenters warned that the proposed SIP disapprovals were flawed and that a failure to achieve all the SIP disapprovals as EPA envisioned would mean that EPA would need to reassess the measures necessary to maximize cost-effective ozone-level improvements in light of a different set of States.  EPA proceeded to issue its final FIP without addressing this concern.  Instead, EPA announced that its plan was severable: Should any jurisdiction drop out, the plan would continue to apply unchanged to the remaining jurisdictions.  Ongoing litigation over the SIP disapprovals soon vindicated at least some of the commenters’ concerns.  Courts stayed 12 of the SIP disapprovals, which meant EPA could not apply its FIP to those States.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-d jy-both indent_l-187 indent_h-187\">  A number of the remaining States and industry groups challenged the FIP in the D.&nbsp;C. Circuit.  They argued that EPA’s decision to apply the FIP after so many other States had dropped out was “arbitrary” or “capricious,” and they asked the court to stay any effort to enforce the FIP against them while their appeal unfolded.  The D. C. Circuit denied relief, and the parties renewed their request in this Court.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-e jy-both\"><em>Held</em>:&nbsp;The applications for a stay are granted; enforcement of EPA’s rule against the applicants shall be stayed pending the disposition of the applicants’ petition for review in the D.&nbsp;C. Circuit and any petition for writ of certiorari, timely sought.  Pp.&nbsp;9–20.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> (a)&nbsp;When deciding an application for a stay, the Court asks (1) whether the applicant is likely to succeed on the merits, (2) whether it will suffer irreparable injury without a stay, (3) whether the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceedings, and (4) where the public interest lies.  <em>Nken</em> v. <em>Holder</em>, <a aria-label=\"556 U. S. 418\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/556/418\">556 U.&nbsp;S. 418</a>, 434.  When States and other parties seek to stay the enforcement of a federal regulation against them, often “the harms and equities [will be] very weighty on both sides.”  <em>Labrador</em> v. <em>Poe</em>, 601 U.&nbsp;S. ___, ___ (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Kavanaugh</span>, J., concurring in grant of stay).  Because that is true here, resolution of applicants’ stay request ultimately turns on the first question: Who is likely to prevail at the end.  See <em>Nken</em>, 556 U.&nbsp;S., at 434.  Pp.&nbsp;9–11.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> (b)&nbsp;Applicants are likely to prevail on their arbitrary-or-capricious claim.  An agency action qualifies as “arbitrary” or “capricious” if it is not “reasonable and reasonably explained.”  <em>FCC</em> v. <em>Prometheus Radio Project</em>, <a aria-label=\"592 U. S. 414\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/592/414\">592 U.&nbsp;S. 414</a>, 423.  Thus, the agency must offer “a satisfactory explanation for its action[,] including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made” and cannot simply ignore “an important aspect of the problem.”  <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc.</em> v. <em>State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"463 U. S. 29\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/463/29\">463 U.&nbsp;S. 29</a>, 43.  &nbsp;EPA’s plan rested on an assumption that all the upwind States would adopt emissions-reduction measures up to a uniform level of costs to the point of diminishing returns.  Commenters posed their concerns that if upwind States fell out of the planned FIP, the point at which emissions-control measures maximize cost-effective downwind air-quality improvements might shift.  To this question, EPA offered no reasoned response.  As a result, the applicants are likely to prevail on their argument that EPA’s final rule was not “reasonably explained,” <em>Prometheus Radio Project</em>, 592 U.&nbsp;S., at 423, and that it instead ignored “an important aspect of the problem” before it, <em>State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.</em>, 463 U.&nbsp;S., at 43.  Pp.&nbsp;11–13.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> (c)&nbsp;EPA’s alternative arguments are unavailing.  First, EPA argues that adding a “severability” provision to its final rule—<em>i.e., </em>providing the FIP would “continue to be implemented” without regard to the number of States remaining—responded to commenters’ concerns.  But EPA’s response did not address those concerns so much as it sidestepped them.  Nothing in the final rule’s severability provision actually addressed whether and how measures found to maximize cost-effectiveness in achieving downwind ozone air-quality improvements with the participation of all the upwind States remain so when many fewer States might be subject to the agency’s plan.  Second, EPA insists that no one raised that concern during the public comment period.  The Act’s “reasonable specificity” requirement, however, does not mean a party must rehearse the identical argument made before the agency.  Here, EPA had notice of the objection, and its own statements and actions confirm the agency appreciated the concern.  Third, EPA argues that applicants must return to EPA and file a motion asking it to reconsider its final rule before presenting their objection in court because the “grounds for [their] objection arose after the period for public comment.”  §7607(d)(7)(B).

Under that law’s terms, States bear “primary responsibility” for developing plans to achieve air-quality goals.  <a aria-label=\"42 USC 7401 a 3\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7401#a_3\">42 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §7401(a)(3)</a>.  Should a State fail to prepare a legally compliant plan, however, the federal government may sometimes step in and assume that authority for itself.  §7410(c)(1).  Here, the federal government announced its intention to reject over 20 States’ plans for controlling ozone pollution.  In their place, the government sought to impose a single, uniform federal plan.  This litigation  concerns whether, in adopting that plan, the federal government complied with the terms of the Act.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">I</h3>\n<h4 class=\"jy-center\">A</h4>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> “The Clean Air Act regulates air quality through a &nbsp;federal-state collaboration.”  <em>EME Homer City Generation, L.P. </em>v. <em>EPA</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/795_F.3d_118\">795 F.&nbsp;3d 118</a>, 124 (CADC 2015).  Periodically, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets standards for common air pollutants, as necessary to “protect the public health.”  §§7409(a)(1), (b)(1).  Once EPA sets a new standard, the clock starts ticking:  States have three years to design and submit a plan—called a State Implementation Plan, or SIP—providing for the “implementation, maintenance, and enforcement” of that standard in their jurisdictions.  §7410(a)(1); see <em>EPA </em>v. <em>EME Homer City Generation, L. P.</em>,<em> </em><a aria-label=\"572 U. S. 489\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/572/489\">572 U.&nbsp;S. 489</a>, 498 (2014).  Under the Act, States decide how to measure ambient air quality.  §7410(a)(2)(B).  States pick “emission limitations and other control measures.”  §7410(a)(2)(A).  And States provide for the enforcement of their prescribed measures.  §7410(a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> At the same time, States must design these plans with their neighbors in mind.  &nbsp;Because air currents can carry pollution across state borders, emissions in upwind States sometimes affect air quality in downwind States.  See <em>EME Homer</em>,<em> </em>572 U.&nbsp;S., at 496.  To address that externality problem, under the Act’s “Good Neighbor Provision,” state plans must prohibit emissions “in amounts which will .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance by, any other State” of the relevant air-quality standard.  §7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Because the States bear “primary responsibility” for developing compliance plans, §7401(a)(3), EPA has “no authority to question the wisdom of a State’s choices of emission limitations.”  <em>Train </em>v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"421 U. S. 60\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/421/60\">421 U.&nbsp;S. 60</a>, 79 (1975).  So long as a SIP satisfies the “applicable requirements” of the Act, including the Good Neighbor Provision, EPA “shall approve” it within 18 months of its submission.  §7410(k)(3); see §§7410(k)(1)(B), (k)(2).  If, however, a SIP falls short, EPA “shall” issue a Federal Implementation Plan, or FIP, for the noncompliant State—that is, “unless” the State corrects the deficiencies in its SIP first.  §7410(c)(1); <em>EME Homer</em>, 572 U.&nbsp;S., at 498.  EPA must also ensure States meet the new air-quality standard by a statutory deadline.  See §7511.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> A layer of ozone in the atmosphere shields the world from the sun’s radiation.  See <em>National Resources Defense Council </em>v. <em>EPA</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/464_F.3d_1\">464 F.&nbsp;3d 1</a>, 3 (CADC 2006).<em> </em>But closer to earth, ozone can hurt more than it helps.  Forming when sunlight interacts with a wide range of precursor pollutants, ground-level ozone can trigger and exacerbate health problems and damage vegetation.  <a aria-label=\"80 FR 65299\" href=\"/rio/citation/80_FR_65299\">80 Fed. Reg. 65299</a>, 65302, 65370 (2015).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> To mitigate those and other problems, in 2015 EPA revised its air-quality standards for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion.  <em>Id</em>., at 65293–65294.  That change triggered a requirement for States to submit new SIPs.  <em>Id</em>., at 65437.  Along the way, EPA issued a guidance document advising States that they had “flexibility” in choosing how to address their Good Neighbor obligations.  See EPA, Memorandum, Information on the Interstate Transport State Implementation Plan Submissions for the 2015 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards 3 (Mar. 27, 2018).  With that and other guidance in hand, many (though not all) States submitted SIPs.  See <a aria-label=\"84 FR 66612\" href=\"/rio/citation/84_FR_66612\">84 Fed. Reg. 66612</a> (2019).  And many of the States that did submit SIPs said that they need not adopt emissions-control measures to comply with the Good Neighbor Provision because, among other things, they were not linked to downwind air-quality problems or they could identify no additional cost-effective methods of controlling the emissions beyond those they were currently employing.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <a aria-label=\"87 FR 9798\" href=\"/rio/citation/87_FR_9798\">87 Fed. Reg. 9798</a>, 9810 (2022); <a aria-label=\"87 FR 9545\" href=\"/rio/citation/87_FR_9545\">87 Fed. Reg. 9545</a>, 9552 (2022); see generally <a aria-label=\"88 FR 9336\" href=\"/rio/citation/88_FR_9336\">88 Fed. Reg. 9336</a>, 9354–9361 (2023).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> For over two years, EPA did not act on the SIPs it received.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <a aria-label=\"87 FR 9838\" href=\"/rio/citation/87_FR_9838\">87 Fed. Reg. 9838</a>, 9845–9851 (2022).  Then, in February 2022, the agency announced its intention to disapprove 19 of them on the ground that the States submitting them had failed to address adequately their obligations under the Good Neighbor Provision.<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Gorsuch Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-1\" id=\"OPINION_4-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a>  A few months later, the agency proposed disapproving four more SIPs.<a aria-label=\"reference 2 of Gorsuch Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-2\" id=\"OPINION_4-2ref\"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a>  Pursuant to the Act, the agency issued its proposed SIP disapprovals for public comment before finalizing them.  See §7607(d)(3).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">&nbsp;C</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> During that public comment period, the agency proposed a single FIP to bind all 23 States.<a aria-label=\"reference 3 of Gorsuch Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-3\" id=\"OPINION_4-3ref\"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></a> <a aria-label=\"87 FR 20036\" href=\"/rio/citation/87_FR_20036\">87 Fed. Reg. 20036</a>, 20038 (2022).  Rather than continue to encourage “&nbsp;‘flexibilit[y]’&nbsp;” and different state approaches, EPA now apparently took the view that “[e]ffective policy solutions to the problem of interstate ozone transport” demanded that kind of “uniform framework” and “[n]ationwide consistency.”  <a aria-label=\"87 FR 9841\" href=\"/rio/citation/87_FR_9841\">87 Fed. Reg. 9841</a>; see <a aria-label=\"87 FR 20073\" href=\"/rio/citation/87_FR_20073\">87 Fed. Reg. 20073</a>.  The FIP the agency proposed set as its target the reduction of the emissions of one ozone precursor in particular:  nitrous oxide.  See <em>id.</em>, at 20038.  And it sought to impose nitrous oxide emissions-control measures that “maximized cost-effectiveness” in achieving “downwind ozone air quality improvements.”  <em>Id</em>., at 20055; see also <em>id</em>., at 20043.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In broad strokes, here is how EPA’s proposed rule worked to eliminate a State’s “significant contribution” to downwind ozone problems.  First, the agency identified various emissions-control measures and, using nationwide data, calculated how much each typically costs to reduce a ton of nitrous-oxide emissions.  <em>Id</em>., at 20076; see, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>id</em>., at 20077–20081.  Next, the agency sought to predict how much each upwind State’s nitrous-oxide emissions would fall if emissions-producing facilities in the State adopted each measure.  <em>Id</em>., at 20076; see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>id.</em>, at<em> </em>20088–20089; EPA, Ozone Transport Policy Analysis Proposed Rule TSD 22–23 (EPA–HQ–OAR–2021–0668, 2022) (Proposed Ozone Analysis).  In making those predictions, EPA often considered data specific to the emissions-producing facilities in the State, and fed “unit-level and state-level” values into its calculations.  See <em>id</em>., at 9–10, 13.  Then, the agency estimated how much, on average, ozone levels would fall in downwind States with the adoption of each measure.  87 Fed. Reg<em>.</em> 20076; see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>id.</em>, at<em> </em>20092–20093, 20096–20097; Proposed Ozone Analysis 51–52.  In making those estimations, too, EPA calibrated its modeling to each State’s features, “determin[ing] the relationship between changes in emissions and changes in ozone contributions on a state-by-state .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. basis.”  <em>Id</em>., at 33; see also <em>id</em>., at 40, 42.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> To pick which measures would “maximiz[e] cost-&nbsp;effectiveness” in achieving “downwind ozone air quality improvements,” <a aria-label=\"87 FR 20055\" href=\"/rio/citation/87_FR_20055\">87 Fed. Reg. 20055</a>, EPA focused on what it called the “&nbsp;‘knee in the curve,’&nbsp;” or the point at which more expenditures in the upwind States were likely to produce “very little” in the way of “additional emissions reductions and air quality improvement” downwind, <em>id.</em>, at 20095 (hyphenation omitted).  EPA used this point to select a “uniform level” of cost, and so a uniform package of emissions-reduction tools, for upwind States to adopt.  <em>Id</em>., at 20076.  And EPA performed this analysis on two “parallel tracks”—one for power plants, one for other industries.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Pursuant to the Clean Air Act, §§7607(d)(1)(B), (d)(3)–(6), the agency published its proposed FIP for notice and comment in April 2022, <a aria-label=\"87 FR 20036\" href=\"/rio/citation/87_FR_20036\">87 Fed. Reg. 20036</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Immediately, commenters warned of a potential pitfall in the agency’s approach.  EPA had determined which &nbsp;emissions-control measures were cost effective at addressing downwind ozone levels based on an assumption that the FIP would apply to all covered States.  But what happens if some or many of those States are not covered?  As the commenters portrayed the SIPs, this was not an entirely speculative possibility.  Many believed EPA’s disapprovals of the SIPs were legally flawed.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Comments of Missouri Dept. of Natural Resources 3 (June 17, 2022) (referencing “all the technical, legal, and procedural issues” with the proposed SIP disapproval); see also, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., Comments of Louisiana Dept. of Environmental Quality 1–&nbsp;3 (June 21, 2022); Comments of Texas Comm’n on Environmental Quality 2–4 (June 21, 2022); EPA, Response to Public Comments on Proposed Rule 9–11 (EPA–HQ–OAR–2021–0668).  They added that EPA’s FIP was “inextricably linked” to the SIP disapprovals.  <em>E</em>.<em>g</em>., Comments of Missouri Dept. of Natural Resources, at 4.  Without a SIP disapproval or missing SIP, after all, EPA could not include a State in its FIP.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>id.</em>, at 3; <em>supra</em>, at 3.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Commenters added that failing to include a State could have consequences for the proposed FIP.  If the FIP did not wind up applying to all 23 States as EPA envisioned, commenters argued, the agency would need “to conduct a new assessment and modeling of contribution and subject those findings to public comment.”  <em>E</em>.<em>g</em>., Comments of Air Stewardship Coalition 13–14 (June 21, 2022); Comments of Portland Cement Association 7 (June 21, 2022).  Why?  As noted above, EPA assessed “significant contribution” by determining what measures in upwind States would maximize cost-effective ozone-level improvements in the States downwind of them.  <em>Supra</em>, at 5–6.  And a different set of States might mean that the “knee in the curve” would shift.  After all, each State differs in its mix of industries, in its pre-&nbsp;existing emissions-control measures, and in the impact those measures may have on emissions and downwind air quality.  See <a aria-label=\"87 FR 20052\" href=\"/rio/citation/87_FR_20052\">87 Fed. Reg. 20052</a>, 20060, 20071–20073; EPA, Technical Memorandum, Screening Assessment of Potential Emissions Reductions, Air Quality Impacts, and Costs from Non-EGU Emissions Units for 2026, pp. 12–13 (2022).<a aria-label=\"reference 4 of Gorsuch Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-4\" id=\"OPINION_4-4ref\"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> As it happened, ongoing litigation over the SIP disap-&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp;provals soon seemed to vindicate at least some of the commenters’ concerns.  Two circuits issued stays of EPA’s SIP denials for four States.  See Order in No. 23–60069 (CA5, May 1, 2023) (Texas and Louisiana); Order in No. 23–1320 (CA8, May 25, 2023) (Arkansas); Order in No. 23–1719 (CA8, May 26, 2023) (Missouri).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Despite those comments and developments, the agency proceeded to issue its final FIP.  <a aria-label=\"88 FR 36654\" href=\"/rio/citation/88_FR_36654\">88 Fed. Reg. 36654</a> (2023).<a aria-label=\"reference 5 of Gorsuch Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-5\" id=\"OPINION_4-5ref\"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup></a>  In response to the problem commenters raised, EPA adopted a severability provision stating that, should any jurisdiction drop out, its rule would “continue to be implemented as to any remaining jurisdictions.”  <em>Id</em>., at 36693.  But in doing so, EPA did not address whether or why the same emissions-control measures it mandated would continue to further the FIP’s stated purpose of maximizing cost-effective air-quality improvement if fewer States remained in the plan.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">D</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> After EPA issued its final FIP, litigation over the agency’s SIP disapprovals continued.  One court after another issued one stay after another.<a aria-label=\"reference 6 of Gorsuch Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-6\" id=\"OPINION_4-6ref\"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup></a>  Each new stay meant another&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\">&nbsp;State to which EPA could not apply its FIP.  See §7410(c)(1).  Ultimately, EPA recognized that it could not apply its FIP to 12 of the 23 original States.<a aria-label=\"reference 7 of Gorsuch Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-7\" id=\"OPINION_4-7ref\"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup></a>  Together, these 12 States accounted for over 70 percent of the emissions EPA had planned to address through its FIP.

Circuit.  They pointed to the Act’s provisions authorizing a court to “reverse any .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. action” taken in connection with a FIP that is “arbitrary” or “capricious.”  §7607(d)(9)(A).  And they argued that EPA’s decision to apply the FIP to them even after so many other States had dropped out met that standard.  As part of their challenge, they asked that court to stay any effort to enforce the FIP against them while their appeal unfolded.  After that court denied relief, the applicants renewed their request here.  The Court has received and reviewed over 400 pages of briefing and a voluminous record,  held over an hour of oral argument on the applications, and engaged in months of postargument deliberations as we often do for the cases we hear.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">II</h3>\n<h4 class=\"jy-center\">A</h4>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Stay applications are nothing new.  They seek a form of interim relief perhaps “as old as the judicial system of the nation.”  <em>Scripps-Howard Radio, Inc. </em>v. <em>FCC</em>, <a aria-label=\"316 U.

Like any other federal court faced with a stay request, we must provide the applicants with an answer—“grant or deny.”  <em>Labrador </em>v. <em>Poe</em>, 601 U.&nbsp;S. ___, ___ (2024) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Kavanaugh, J., </span>concurring in grant of stay) (slip op., at 2).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In deciding whether to issue a stay, we apply the same “sound .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. principles” as other federal courts.  <em>Nken </em>v. <em>Holder</em>, <a aria-label=\"556 U.

Specifically, in this litigation, we ask (1) whether the applicant is likely to succeed on the merits, (2) whether it will suffer irreparable injury without a stay, (3) whether the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceedings, and (4) where the public interest lies.  <em>Ibid.</em>; States’ Application 13; Response in Opposition for Respondent EPA in No. 23A349 etc., p. 16 (EPA Response).<a aria-label=\"reference 9 of Gorsuch Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-9\" id=\"OPINION_4-9ref\"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> When States and other parties seek to stay the enforcement of a federal regulation against them, often “the harms and equities [will be] very weighty on both sides.”  <em>Labrador</em>, 601 U.&nbsp;S., at ___ (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Kavanaugh</span>, J.) (slip op., at 3).  That is certainly the case here, for both sides have strong arguments with respect to the latter three <em>Nken</em> factors.  On one side of the ledger, the federal government points to the air-quality benefits its FIP offers downwind States.  EPA Response 48–50.  On the other side, the States observe that a FIP issued unlawfully (as they contend this one was) necessarily impairs their sovereign interests in regulating their own industries and citizens—interests the Act expressly recognizes.

S. 414\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/592/414\">592 U.&nbsp;S. 414</a>, 423 (2021).  In reviewing an agency’s action under that standard, a court may not “&nbsp;‘substitute its judgment for that of the agency.’&nbsp;”  <em>FCC</em> v. <em>Fox Television Stations, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"556 U. S. 502\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/556/502\">556 U.&nbsp;S. 502</a>, 513 (2009).  But it must ensure, among other things, that the agency has offered “a satisfactory explanation for its action[,] including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.”  <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc.</em> v. <em>State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co</em>., <a aria-label=\"463 U. S. 29\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/463/29\">463 U.&nbsp;S. 29</a>, 43 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Accordingly, an agency cannot simply ignore “an important aspect of the problem.”  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> We agree with the applicants that EPA’s final FIP likely runs afoul of these long-settled standards.  The problem stems from the way EPA chose to determine which emissions “contribute[d] significantly” to downwind States’ difficulty meeting national ozone standards.  <a aria-label=\"42 USC 7410 a 2 D i...\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7410#a_2_D_i_I\">42 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I)</a>.  Recall that EPA’s plan rested on an assumption that all 23 upwind States would adopt emissions-reduction tools up to a “uniform” level of “costs” to the point of diminishing returns.  <a aria-label=\"87 FR 20076\" href=\"/rio/citation/87_FR_20076\">87 Fed. Reg. 20076</a>, 20095; <a aria-label=\"88 FR 36661\" href=\"/rio/citation/88_FR_36661\">88 Fed. Reg. 36661</a>, 36683–36684, 36719; see Part I–C, <em>supra</em>.  But as the applicants ask:  What happens—as in fact did happen—when many of the upwind States fall out of the planned FIP and it may now cover only a fraction of the States and emissions EPA anticipated?  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., States’ Application 16–21; Application for American Forest &amp; Paper Association et&nbsp;al. 14–15, 19–20.  Does that affect the “knee in the curve,” or the point at which the remaining States might still “maximiz[e] cost-effectiv[e]” downwind ozone-level improvements?  <a aria-label=\"87 FR 20055\" href=\"/rio/citation/87_FR_20055\">87 Fed. Reg. 20055</a>.  As “the mix of states changes, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and their particular technologies and industries drop out with them,” might the point at which emissions-control measures maximize cost-effective downwind air-quality improvements also shift?  Tr. of Oral Arg. 6.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Although commenters posed this concern to EPA during the notice and comment period, see Part I–C, <em>supra</em>, EPA offered no reasoned response.  Indeed, at argument the government acknowledged that it could not represent with certainty whether the cost-effectiveness analysis it performed collectively for 23 States would yield the same results and command the same emissions-control measures if conducted for, say, just one State.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 58–59.  Perhaps &nbsp;there is some explanation why the number and identity of participating States does not affect what measures maximize cost-effective downwind air-quality improvements.  But if there is an explanation, it does not appear in the final rule.  As a result, the applicants are likely to prevail on their argument that EPA’s final rule was not “reasonably explained,” <em>Prometheus Radio Project</em>, 592 U.&nbsp;S., at 423, that the agency failed to supply “a satisfactory explanation for its action[,]” <em>State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co</em>., 463 U.&nbsp;S., at 43, and that it instead ignored “an important aspect of the problem” before it, <em>ibid</em>.  The applicants are therefore likely to be entitled to “revers[al]” of the FIP’s mandates on them.  §7607(d)(9).<a aria-label=\"reference 10 of Gorsuch Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-10\" id=\"OPINION_4-10ref\"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">III</h3>\n<h4 class=\"jy-center\">A</h4>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Resisting this conclusion, EPA advances three alternative arguments.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>First</em>, the government insists, the agency did offer a reasoned response to the applicants’ concern, just not the one they hoped.  When finalizing its rule in response to public comments, the government represents, “the agency <em>did </em>consider whether the [FIP] could cogently be applied to a subset of the 23 covered States.”  EPA Response 27; see also <em>post</em>, at 17–18 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Barrett, J.</span>, dissenting).  And that consideration, the government stresses, led EPA to add a “severability” provision to its final rule in which the agency announced that the FIP would “&nbsp;‘continue to be implemented’&nbsp;” without regard to the number of States remaining, even if just one State remained subject to its terms.  EPA Response 27<em> </em>(quoting <a aria-label=\"88 FR 36693\" href=\"/rio/citation/88_FR_36693\">88 Fed. Reg. 36693</a>).  In support of its severability provision, EPA cited, among other things, its intent to address “&nbsp;‘important public health and environmental benefits” and encourage reliance by others “on th[e] final rule in their planning.’ ”  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> None of this, however, solves the agency’s problem.  True, the severability provision highlights that EPA was aware of the applicants’ concern.  But awareness is not itself an explanation.  The severability provision highlights, too, the agency’s desire to apply its rule expeditiously and “&nbsp;‘to the greatest extent possible,’&nbsp;” no matter how many States it could cover.  <em>Ibid.  </em>But none of that, nor anything else EPA said in support of its severability provision, addresses whether and how measures found to maximize cost effectiveness in achieving downwind ozone air-quality improvements with the participation of 23 States remain so when many fewer States, responsible for a much smaller amount of the originally targeted emissions, might be subject to the agency’s plan.  Put simply, EPA’s response did not address the applicants’ concern so much as sidestep it.<a aria-label=\"reference 11 of Gorsuch Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-11\" id=\"OPINION_4-11ref\"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; <em>Second</em>, the government pivots in nearly the opposite direction.  Now, it says, if its final rule lacks a reasoned response to the applicants’ concern, it is because no one raised that concern during the public comment period.  And, the agency stresses, a litigant may pursue in court only claims premised on objections first “&nbsp;‘raised with reasonable specificity’&nbsp;” before the agency during the public comment period.  <em>Id</em>., at 19–20 (quoting §7607(d)(7)(B)); see also <em>post</em>,<em> </em>at 8–11.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> We cannot agree.  The Act’s “reasonable specificity” requirement does not call for “a hair-splitting approach.”  <em>Appalachian Power Co. </em>v.<em> EPA</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/135_F.3d_791\">135 F.&nbsp;3d 791</a>, 817 (CADC 1998).  A party need not “rehears[e]” the identical argument made before the agency; it need only confirm that the government had “notice of [the] challenge” during the public comment period and a chance to consider “in substance, if not in form, the same objection now raised” in court.  <em>Id.</em>, at 818; see also, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Bahr </em>v.<em> Regan</em>, 6 F.&nbsp;4th 1059, 1070 (CA9 2021).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Here, EPA had notice of the objection the applicants seek to press in court.  Commenters alerted the agency that, should some States no longer participate in the plan, the agency would need to return to the drawing board and “conduct a new assessment and modeling of contribution” to determine what emissions-control measures maximized cost effectiveness in securing downwind ozone air-quality improvements.  Comments of Air Stewardship Coalition, at 13–14; see also Part I–C, <em>supra</em> (noting examples of other comments).  And, as we have just seen, EPA’s own statements and actions confirm the agency appreciated that concern.  In preparing the final rule in response to public comments, the agency emphatically insists, it “<em>did</em> consider whether the [r]ule could cogently be applied to a subset of the 23 covered States.”  EPA Response 27.  And as a result of that consideration, the agency observes, it opted to add a severability provision to its final rule.  <em>Ibid.</em>  By its own words and actions, then, the agency demonstrated that it was on notice of the applicants’ concern.  Yet, as we have seen, it failed to address the concern adequately.<a aria-label=\"reference 12 of Gorsuch Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-12\" id=\"OPINION_4-12ref\"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Third</em>, the government pursues one more argument in the alternative.  As the agency sees it, the applicants must return to EPA and file a motion asking it to reconsider its final rule before presenting their objection in court.  They must, the agency says, because the “grounds for [their] objection arose after the period for public comment.”  §7607(d)(7)(B); see EPA Response 20–21.  As just discussed, however, EPA had the basis of the applicants’ objection before it during the comment period.  It chose to respond with a severability provision that in no way grappled with their concern.  Nothing requires the applicants to return to EPA to raise (again) a concern EPA already had a chance to address.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Taking the government’s argument (much) further, the dissent posits that every “objection that [a] final rule was not reasonably explained” must be raised in a motion for reconsideration.  <em>Post</em>, at 7 (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis deleted).  But there is a reason why the government does not go so far.  &nbsp;The Clean Air Act opens the courthouse doors to those with objections the agency already ignored.  If an “objection [is] raised with reasonable specificity during the period for public comment” but not reasonably addressed in the final rule, the Act permits an immediate challenge.  §7607(d)(7)(B).  A person need not go back to the agency and insist on an explanation a second time.  Tellingly, the case on which the dissent relies involves an entirely different situation:  a “&nbsp;‘logical outgrowth’ challeng[e].”  <em>Post</em>, at 7.  There, the objection was that EPA had supposedly “&nbsp;‘significantly amend[ed] the [r]ule between the proposed and final versions,’&nbsp;” making it impossible for people to comment on the rule during the comment period.  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting<em> EME Homer</em>, <a aria-label=\"795 F.3d 137\" href=\"/rio/citation/795_F.3d_137\">795 F.&nbsp;3d, at 137</a>).  That is nothing like the challenge here, where EPA failed to address an important problem the public could and did raise during the comment period.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> With the government’s theories unavailing, the dissent advances others of its own.  It begins by suggesting that the problem the applicants raise was not “&nbsp;‘<em>important</em>’&nbsp;” enough to warrant a reasoned reply from the agency because the methodology EPA employed in its FIP “appear[s] not to depend on the number of covered States.”  <em>Post</em>, at 12–17, 18–19.  Then, coming at the same point from another direction, the dissent seeks to excuse the agency’s lack of a reasoned reply as “harmless” given, again, “the apparent lack of connection between the number of States covered and the FIP’s methodology.”  <em>Post</em>, at 20.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The trouble is, if the government had arguments along these lines, it did not make them.  It did not despite its ample resources and voluminous briefing.  See <em>supra</em>, at 9.  This Court “normally decline[s] to entertain” arguments “forfeited” by the parties.  <em>Kingdomware Technologies, Inc.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"579 U. S. 162\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/579/162\">579 U.&nbsp;S. 162</a>, 173 (2016).  And we see no persuasive reason to depart from that rule here.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> If anything, we see one reason for caution after another.  Start with the fact the dissent itself expresses little confidence in its own theories, contending no more than it “<em>appear</em>[<em>s</em>]” EPA’s methodology did not depend on the number of covered States.  <em>Post</em>, at 14 (emphasis added).  Add to that the fact that, at oral argument, even the government refused to say with certainty that EPA would have reached the same conclusions regardless of which States were included in the FIP.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 59.  Combine all that with the further fact that, in developing the FIP, EPA said it used the “same regulatory framework” this Court described in <em>EME Homer City Generation, L. P. </em>v. <em>EPA</em>, <a aria-label=\"572 U. S. 489\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/572/489\">572 U.&nbsp;S. 489</a>.  <em>E</em>.<em>g</em>., EPA Response 7–8.  And, at least as the Court described that framework, state-level analyses play a significant role in EPA’s work.<a aria-label=\"reference 13 of Gorsuch Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-13\" id=\"OPINION_4-13ref\"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup></a>  Finally, observe that, while the Act seems to anticipate, as the dissent suggests, that the agency’s “procedural determinations” may be subject to harmless-error review, §7607(d)(8), the Act also seems to treat separately challenges to agency “actions” like the FIP before us, authorizing courts to “reverse any .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. action,” found to be “arbitrary” or “capricious,” §7607(d)(9)(A) (emphasis added).  With so many reasons for caution, we think sticking to our normal course of declining to consider forfeited arguments the right course here.<a aria-label=\"reference 14 of Gorsuch Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-14\" id=\"OPINION_4-14ref\"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">&nbsp;*</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The applications for a stay in Nos. 23A349, 23A350, 23A351, and 23A384 are granted.

Our conclusion is narrower:  When faced with comments like the ones it received, EPA needed to explain why it believed its rule would continue to offer cost-effective improvements in downwind air quality with only a subset of the States it originally intended to cover.  To be sure, after this Court heard argument, EPA issued a document in which it sought to provide further explanations for the course it pursued.  See <a aria-label=\"89 FR 23526\" href=\"/rio/citation/89_FR_23526\">89 Fed. Reg. 23526</a> (2024).  But the government has not suggested that we should consult this analysis in assessing the validity of the final rule.  See Letter from E. Prelogar, Solicitor General, to S. Harris, Clerk of Court 1 (Mar. 28, 2024).  Nor could it, since the Clean Air Act prevents us (and courts that may in the future assess the FIP’s merits) from consulting explanations and information offered after the rule’s promulgation.  See <a aria-label=\"42 USC 7607 d 6 C\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7607#d_6_C\">42 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §§7607(d)(6)(C)</a> (“The promulgated rule may not be based (in part or whole) on any information or data which has not been placed in the docket as of the date of such promulgation”), 7607(d)(7)(A) (restricting the “record for judicial review”).

But the dissent fails to acknowledge that, for purposes of the FIP, States are a sum of their emissions-producing facilities.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Ozone Transport Policy Analysis Final Rule TSD 12 (EPA–HQ–OAR–2021–0668, 2023) (Final Ozone Analysis).  Similarly, the dissent characterizes the comment indicating EPA would need to “conduct a new assessment and modeling” if States dropped out of the FIP as a complaint about the “sequencing” of the proposed SIP disapprovals and the FIP.  <em>Post</em>, at 10.  But why would the sequencing matter?  Because the FIP cannot apply to a State if its SIP is not disapproved.  See Part I–A, <em>supra</em>.  And why would EPA need to perform a “new assessment and modeling of contribution”?  Because it may be that “the math .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. wouldn’t necessarily turn out the same” if some States were not covered by the FIP.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 59.  Fairly on notice of the concern, EPA needed to, and by its own admission sought to, “consider” whether its FIP could apply to a subset of States.

But other statements in that rule and supporting documents also seem to suggest EPA considered state-specific information.  See Part I–C, <em>supra</em>.  If, as the dissent posits, only nationwide data informed EPA’s analysis, why would EPA say that, “for purposes of identifying the appropriate level of control,” it focused on “the 23 upwind states that were linked” to the downwind States, rather than, say, “all states in the contiguous U.S.”?  Final Ozone Analysis 3 (footnote omitted).  Why would EPA explain that its “findings regarding air quality improvement” downwind were a “central component” of picking the appropriate cost levels and so defining a State’s significant contribution?  <a aria-label=\"88 FR 36741\" href=\"/rio/citation/88_FR_36741\">88 Fed. Reg. 36741</a>.  And why would EPA bother to “determine the relationship between changes in emissions and changes in ozone contributions on a state-by-state .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. basis” and “calibrat[e]” that relationship “based on state-specific source apportionment”?

In so doing, the Court grants emergency relief in a fact-&nbsp;intensive and highly technical case without fully engaging with both the relevant law and the voluminous record.  While the Court suggests that the EPA failed to explain itself sufficiently in response to comments, this theory must surmount sizable procedural obstacles and contrary record &nbsp;evidence.  Applicants therefore cannot satisfy the stringent conditions for relief in this posture.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">I</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> I will start by setting the record straight with respect to some important background.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>First</em>, the Court downplays EPA’s statutory role in ensuring that States meet air-quality standards.  <em>Ante</em>, at 2–3.  The Clean Air Act directs EPA to “establish national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for pollutants at levels that will protect public health.”  <em>EPA</em> v. <em>EME Homer City Generation, L.&nbsp;P.</em>, <a aria-label=\"572 U. S. 489\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/572/489\">572 U.&nbsp;S. 489</a>, 498 (2014); see <a aria-label=\"42 USC\" href=\"/uscode/text/42\">42</a> U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §§<a aria-label=\"42 USC 7408\" href=\"/uscode/text/42/7408\">7408</a>, <a aria-label=\"42 USC 7409\" href=\"/uscode/text/42/7409\">7409</a>.  States must create State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to ensure that their air meets these standards.  §7410(a)(1).  But States also face an externality problem: “Pollutants generated by upwind sources are often transported by air currents .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to downwind States,” relieving upwind States “of the associated costs” and making it difficult for downwind States to “maintain satisfactory air quality.”  <em>EME</em>, 572 U.&nbsp;S., at 496.  So the Act’s Good Neighbor Provision requires SIPs to “prohibi[t]” the State’s emissions sources from “emitting any air pollutant in amounts which will .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance by, any other State with respect to any [NAAQS].”  §7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Given the incentives of upwind States to underregulate the pollution they send downwind, the Act requires EPA to determine whether a State “has failed to submit an adequate SIP.”  <em>EME</em>, 572 U.&nbsp;S<em>.</em>, at 498; see §7410(c)(1).  If a SIP does not prevent the State’s polluters from significantly contributing to nonattainment in downwind States, EPA “shall” promulgate a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) that does.  §7410(c)(1).  And EPA must stop the State’s significant contributions by the statutory deadline for the affected downwind States to achieve compliance.  See <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>EPA</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/938_F.3d_303\">938 F.&nbsp;3d 303</a>, 313–314 (CADC 2019) &nbsp;(<em>per&nbsp;curiam</em>); §7511.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Second</em>, the Court fails to recognize that EPA’s SIP disapprovals may, in fact, be valid.  EPA justified its findings that 23 States had failed to submit adequate SIPs.  It<em> </em>found that these States all significantly contributed to ozone pollution in downwind States.  See <a aria-label=\"88 FR 36656\" href=\"/rio/citation/88_FR_36656\">88 Fed. Reg. 36656</a> (2023).  But 21 of these States, including applicants, proposed to do <em>nothing </em>to reduce their ozone-precursor (<em>i.e</em>., NOx)&nbsp;emissions—arguing that they did not actually contribute to downwind nonattainment or that there were no other cost-effective emissions-reduction measures they could impose.  See <a aria-label=\"88 FR 9354\" href=\"/rio/citation/88_FR_9354\">88 Fed. Reg. 9354</a>–9361 (2023).  The other two States failed to submit a SIP at all.  See <a aria-label=\"84 FR 66614\" href=\"/rio/citation/84_FR_66614\">84 Fed. Reg. 66614</a> (2019).  While 12 of EPA’s SIP disapprovals have been <em>temporarily </em>stayed, no court yet has invalidated one.  So EPA’s replacement FIP—the Good Neighbor Plan—may yet apply to all 23 original States.  Indeed, EPA and the plaintiffs who challenged Nevada’s SIP disapproval have proposed a settlement that would lift that stay.  <a aria-label=\"89 FR 35091\" href=\"/rio/citation/89_FR_35091\">89 Fed. Reg. 35091</a> (2024).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Third</em>, the Court claims that commenters on the proposed FIP warned that its emissions limits might change if it covered fewer States, but EPA failed to respond.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6–8.  Not exactly.<em> </em>As I will elaborate below, commenters merely criticized EPA’s decision to propose a FIP before its SIP disapprovals were final.  EPA responded that this sequencing was “consistent with [its] past practice in [its] efforts to timely address good neighbor obligations”: Given the August 2024 deadline for certain States to comply with the 2015 ozone NAAQS, EPA was “obligated” to start the years-long process of promulgating a FIP so that one could be effective in time.  EPA, Response to Public Comments on Proposed Rule 149–150, (EPA–HQ–OAR–2021–0668–1127, June 2023) (Response to Comments); see <em>Wisconsin</em>, <a aria-label=\"938 F.3d 313\" href=\"/rio/citation/938_F.3d_313\">938 F.&nbsp;3d, at 313</a>–314.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Finally</em>, the Court repeatedly characterizes the FIP as relying on an “assumption that [it] would apply to all covered &nbsp;States.”  <em>Ante</em>, at 6; see <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 12.  But try as it might, the Court identifies no evidence that the FIP’s emissions limits would have been different for a different set of States or that EPA’s consideration of state-specific inputs was anything but confirmatory of the limits it calculated based on nationwide data.  See <em>ante</em>, at 5–6, 19, n. 14.  The Court leans on the fact that EPA “considered data specific to the emissions-producing facilities in [each] State” to calculate “how much each upwind State’s [NOx] emissions would fall” if the State’s emitters “adopted each [emissions-control] measure.”  <em>Ante</em>, at 5 (citing EPA, Ozone Transport Policy Analysis Proposed Rule TSD 9–10, 13, 22–23, (EPA–HQ–OAR–2021–0668–0133, Feb. 2022) (Proposed Ozone Analysis)).<em> </em>But the Proposed Ozone Analysis makes clear that EPA did these state-specific calculations to determine each State’s “emissions budget.”  Proposed Ozone Analysis 7–13.  A State’s budget consists of the “emissions that would remain” <em>after</em> the State’s power plants meet the emissions limits that EPA independently calculated.  <a aria-label=\"88 FR 36762\" href=\"/rio/citation/88_FR_36762\">88 Fed. Reg. 36762</a>; see Proposed Ozone Analysis 13 (“adjust[ed]” “unit-level emissions are summed up to the state level”); n.&nbsp;6, <em>infra</em>.  Of course each State’s emissions budget will depend on the emitters in that State.  What matters is whether the <em>limits the FIP imposes on each emitter</em> depend on the number of States the FIP covers.  Tellingly, the Court does not identify any NOx limit for any industry that relied on state-specific data.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> On the contrary, as I will explain in Part II–B, the final rule and its supporting documents suggest that EPA’s methodology for setting emissions limits did not depend on the number of States in the plan, but on nationwide data for the relevant industries—and the FIP contains many examples of emissions limits that EPA created using nationwide inputs.  Moreover, EPA has now confirmed this interpretation.  During this litigation, EPA received petitions seeking reconsideration of the FIP on the ground that it &nbsp;should not be implemented in just a subset of the original States.  EPA denied these petitions on April 4, 2024.  <a aria-label=\"89 FR 23526\" href=\"/rio/citation/89_FR_23526\">89 Fed. Reg. 23526</a>.  It thoroughly explained how its “methodology for defining” each State’s emissions obligations is “independent of the number of states included in the Plan” because it “relies on a determination regarding what emissions reductions each type of regulated source can cost-effectively achieve.”  EPA, Basis for Partial Denial of Petitions for Reconsideration on Scope 1, (EPA–HQ–OAR–2021–0668–1255, Apr. 2024) (Denial).  The “control technologies and cost-effectiveness figures the EPA consider[ed] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. do not depend in any way on the number of states included.”  <em>Id</em>., at 2.  So “[s]ources in the remaining upwind states currently regulated by the Plan .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. would bear the same actual emission reduction obligations” regardless of the number of covered States.  <em>Id.</em>, at 3–4.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">II</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> To obtain emergency relief, applicants must, at a minimum, show that they are likely to succeed on the merits, that they will be irreparably injured absent a stay, and that the balance of the equities favors them.  <em>Nken </em>v. <em>Holder</em>, <a aria-label=\"556 U. S. 418\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/556/418\">556 U.&nbsp;S. 418</a>, 425–426 (2009).  Moreover, we should grant relief only if we would be likely to grant certiorari were the applicants’ case to come to us in the usual course.  See <em>Does 1–3 </em>v. <em>Mills</em>, 595 U.&nbsp;S. ___, ___ (2021) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Barrett</span>, J., concurring in denial of application for injunctive relief&nbsp;); <em>Hollingsworth </em>v. <em>Perry</em>, <a aria-label=\"558 U. S. 183\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/558/183\">558 U.&nbsp;S. 183</a>, 190 (2010) (<em>per&nbsp;curiam</em>).  In my view, the applicants cannot satisfy the stay factors.  Most significantly, they have not shown a likelihood of success on the merits.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Court holds that applicants are likely to succeed on a claim that the Good Neighbor Plan is “arbitrary” or “capricious.”  <a aria-label=\"42 USC 7607 d 9\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7607#d_9\">42 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §7607(d)(9)</a>.  The “arbitrary-and-capricious standard requires that agency action” be both &nbsp;“[1] reasonable and [2] reasonably explained.”  <em>FCC</em> v.<em> Prometheus Radio Project</em>,<em> </em><a aria-label=\"592 U. S. 414\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/592/414\">592 U.&nbsp;S. 414</a>, 423 (2021).  The Court’s theory is that EPA did not “&nbsp;‘reasonably <em>explai[n]&nbsp;</em>’&nbsp;” “why the number and identity of participating States does not affect what measures maximize cost-effective downwind air-quality improvement.”  <em>Ante</em>, at 13 (quoting only the second part of <em>Prometheus Radio</em>’s formulation (emphasis added)).  So to be clear, the Court does not conclude that EPA’s actions were <em>substantively </em>unreasonable—<em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., that the FIP cannot rationally be applied to fewer States because a change in the number of participants would undermine its rationale or render it ineffective.  Nor could it, given the significant evidence in the record (not to mention EPA’s denial of reconsideration) that the covered States did not, in fact, affect the plan’s emissions-reduction obligations.  See Part II–B, <em>infra</em>.  Thus, the only basis for the Court’s decision is the argument that EPA failed to provide “&nbsp;‘a satisfactory explanation for its action’&nbsp;” and a “reasoned response” to comments.  <em>Ante</em>, at 12–13 (quoting <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc.</em> v. <em>State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"463 U. S. 29\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/463/29\">463 U.&nbsp;S. 29</a>, 43 (1983)).  There are at least three major barriers to success on such a claim.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">A</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The Clean Air Act imposes a procedural bar on the challenges that a plaintiff can bring in court: Only objections that were “raised with reasonable specificity during the period for public comment .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. may be raised during judicial review.”  §7607(d)(7)(B).  If it was “impracticable to raise such objection within such time or if the grounds for such objection arose after the period for public comment,” the challenger may petition for reconsideration of the rule and can obtain judicial review only if EPA refuses.  <em>Ibid.</em>  While EPA has now separately denied petitions for reconsideration of the Good Neighbor Plan, this case came to us directly; we are assessing applicants’ likelihood of success in &nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\">&nbsp;challenging the plan itself, not the denial of reconsideration.  So the procedural bar on objections not raised in the comments presents a significant obstacle—in two ways.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>First</em>, consider the Court’s basic theory: that EPA offered “no reasoned response” to comments allegedly questioning whether the plan’s emissions limits depend on the States covered.  <em>Ante</em>, at 12.  That EPA failed to adequately explain its final rule in response to comments is “an objection to the notice and comment process itself,” which applicants “obviously did not and could not have raised .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. during the period for public comment.”  <em>EME Homer City Generation, L.</em>&nbsp;<em>P. </em>v. <em>EPA</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/795_F.3d_118\">795 F.&nbsp;3d 118</a>, 137 (CADC 2015) (Kavanaugh, J.).  No one could have raised <em>during the proposal’s comment period </em>the objection that the “<em>final</em> rule was not ‘reasonably explained.’&nbsp;”  <em>Ante</em>, at 13 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The D.&nbsp;C. Circuit, on remand in <em>EME Homer</em>, considered a similar objection that EPA had “violated the Clean Air Act’s notice and comment requirements”: EPA had “significantly amend[ed] the Rule between the proposed and final versions without providing additional opportunity for notice and comment.”  <a aria-label=\"795 F.3d 137\" href=\"/rio/citation/795_F.3d_137\">795 F.&nbsp;3d, at 137</a>.  But because this procedural objection could not have been raised during the comment period, “the only appropriate path for petitioners” under §7607(d)(7)(B) was to raise it “through an initial petition for reconsideration to EPA.”  <em>Ibid.</em>  So the D.&nbsp;C. Circuit lacked “authority at th[at] time to reach this question.”  <em>Ibid.  </em>While such “logical outgrowth” challenges typically are cognizable under the Administrative Procedure Act, see <em>Shell Oil Co. </em>v. <em>EPA</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/950_F.2d_741\">950 F.&nbsp;2d 741</a>, 747 (CADC 1991), the Clean Air Act channels these challenges through reconsideration proceedings.  This Court’s failure-to-explain objection may face the same problem: It is not judicially reviewable in its current posture.<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Barrett Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-1\" id=\"DISSENT_5-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; <em>Second</em>, even putting aside this aspect of §7607(d)(7)(B), it is not clear that any commenter raised with “reasonable specificity” the underlying substantive issue: that the exclusion of some States from the FIP would undermine EPA’s cost-effectiveness analyses and resulting emissions controls.  §7607(d)(7)(B); see <em>ante</em>, at 13.  The Court concludes otherwise only by putting in the commenters’ mouths words they did not say.  It first cites a bevy of comments arguing that EPA’s “disapprovals of the SIPs were legally flawed” and noting the obvious point that EPA cannot “include a State in its FIP” unless it validly disapproves the State’s SIP.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6.  These comments do not address the continued efficacy of a FIP that applies to a subset of the originally covered States.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Another collection of the Court’s inapposite comments relates to the inclusion of specific sources, emissions controls, and industries in the proposed plan—<em>not</em> States.  See <em>ante</em>, at 7, n.&nbsp;4.  For example, one commenter argued that the “cost effectiveness of the requirement to employ SNCR will be highly variable, and is unlikely to meet EPA expecta&nbsp;tions in even the most optimistic case.”  Comments of Indiana Municipal Power Agency 9 (June 20, 2022).  That is a challenge to EPA’s endorsement of a particular emissions-control technology; it says nothing about the FIP’s dependence on a particular number of States.  See also, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., Comments of Lower Colorado River Authority 21–22 (June 21, 2022).  Similarly, another commenter argued that pulp and paper mills should not be included because the “maximum estimated improvement” in ozone levels from controlling their emissions would be “too small to even measure.”  Comments of Wisconsin Paper Council 2 (June 21, 2022).<a aria-label=\"reference 2 of Barrett Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-2\" id=\"DISSENT_5-2ref\"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a>  An argument that the <em>maximum</em> benefits from regulating an industry are too small is not an argument that those benefits <em>would become</em> too small if fewer States were covered.<a aria-label=\"reference 3 of Barrett Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-3\" id=\"DISSENT_5-3ref\"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The closest comment that the Court can find—which it quotes repeatedly—is one sentence that obliquely refers to some “new assessment and modeling of contribution” that EPA might need to perform.  Comments of Air Stewardship Coalition 13–14 (June 21, 2022).  The Court dresses up this &nbsp;comment by characterizing it as a warning about what might happen “[i]f the FIP did not wind up applying to all 23 States” and responding to the concern that a “different set of States might mean that the ‘knee in the curve’ might shift” and change the cost-effective “emissions-control measures.”  <em>Ante</em>, at 7.  But those words are the Court’s, not the commenter’s.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The commenter’s actual objection was to EPA’s sequencing of its actions—proposing a FIP before it finalized its SIP disapprovals.  The commenter titled this section “EPA Step Two Screening is Premised on the Premature Disapproval of 19 Upwind States[’] Good Neighbor SIPs.”  Air Stewardship Comments 13 (boldface omitted).  And the relevant sentence reads in full:</p>\n<p class=\"bqonly1para jy-both\">“The proposed FIP essentially prejudges the outcome of those pending SIP actions and, in the event EPA takes a different action on those SIPs than contemplated in this proposal, it would be required to conduct a new assessment and modeling of contribution and subject those findings to public comment.”  <em>Id</em>., at 14.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">This sentence says nothing about what would be required if <em>after</em> EPA finalizes its SIP disapprovals and issues a final FIP, some States drop out of the plan.  Nor does it suggest that the plan’s cost-effectiveness thresholds or emissions controls would change with a different number of States.  Nor is it clear what the comment means by its bare reference to a “new assessment and modeling of contribution”: Would EPA be required to perform a new evaluation of which upwind States cause pollution in downwind States?  A new analysis of how much pollution each source must eliminate?  A new assessment of the plan’s impact on downwind States?</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> It is therefore difficult to see how this comment raised with “reasonable specificity” the objection that the removal of some States from the final plan would invalidate EPA’s &nbsp;cost-effectiveness thresholds and chosen emissions-control measures.<a aria-label=\"reference 4 of Barrett Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-4\" id=\"DISSENT_5-4ref\"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup></a>  That is not how EPA understood it.  EPA characterized this comment as arguing that “by taking action before considering comments on the proposed disapprovals, the EPA is presupposing the outcome of its proposed rulemakings on the SIPs.”  Response to Comments 147 (noting this comment’s ID number, 0518).  And EPA explained that it “disagree[d]” with the argument that the “sequence” of its actions was “improper, unreasonable, or bad policy”; EPA had a statutory obligation to promulgate a FIP by the August 2024 NAAQS attainment deadline.  <em>Id</em>., at 150.  If<em> </em>a <em>commenter</em> had said with reasonable specificity what <em>the Court</em> says today—that “a different set of States might mean that the ‘knee in the curve’ might shift,” <em>ante</em>, at 7—EPA could have responded with more explanation of why its methodology did not depend on the number of covered States—as it has recently explained.  But EPA cannot be penalized if it did not have reasonable notice of this objection.<a aria-label=\"reference 5 of Barrett Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-5\" id=\"DISSENT_5-5ref\"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; In sum, §7607(d)(7)(B)’s procedural bar likely forecloses both the failure-to-explain objection that the Court credits and any substantive challenge to the reasonableness of applying the FIP to a subset of the originally covered States.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Even if applicants clear §7607(d)(7)(B)’s procedural bar, they face an uphill battle on the merits.  To prevail on the Court’s theory, applicants must show that EPA’s actions were “arbitrary” or “capricious.”  §§7607(d)(9)(A), (D).  “The scope of review under the ‘arbitrary and capricious’ standard is narrow and a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.”  <em>State Farm</em>, 463 U.&nbsp;S., at 43.  A rule is arbitrary and capricious if the agency “<em>entirely failed</em> to consider an <em>important</em> aspect of the problem.”  <em>Ibid. </em>(emphasis added).  But we will “&nbsp;‘uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency’s path may reasonably be discerned.’&nbsp;”  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Bowman Transp., Inc.</em> v. <em>Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"419 U. S. 281\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/419/281\">419 U.&nbsp;S. 281</a>, 286 (1974)).  Given the explanations and state-agnostic methodology apparent in the final rule and its supporting documentation—and the paucity of comments specifically raising the issue—EPA may well have done enough to justify its plan’s severability.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> To begin, the rule and its supporting documents arguably make clear that EPA’s methodology for calculating cost-effectiveness thresholds and imposing emissions controls did not depend on the number of covered States.  The rule applied EPA’s longstanding “4-step interstate transport framework” to create emissions limits that will prevent NOx sources in upwind States from significantly contributing to ozone pollution in downwind States.  <a aria-label=\"88 FR 36659\" href=\"/rio/citation/88_FR_36659\">88 Fed. Reg. 36659</a>; see <a aria-label=\"42 USC 7410 a 2 D\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7410#a_2_D\">42 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §7410(a)(2)(D)</a>.  Under that framework, EPA (1) identifies “downwind receptors that are expected to have problems attaining or maintaining the NAAQS”; (2) identifies which upwind States are “&nbsp;‘link[ed]’&nbsp;” to those downwind receptors because they contribute at least 1% of a receptor’s &nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp;ozone; (3) determines which NOx sources in the linked upwind States “significantly contribute” to downwind nonattainment or interference; and (4) implements emissions limits to stop those sources’ significant contributions.  <a aria-label=\"88 FR 36659\" href=\"/rio/citation/88_FR_36659\">88 Fed. Reg. 36659</a>; see <em>EME</em>, 572 U.&nbsp;S., at 500–501 (describing similar approach used in earlier FIP).  The first two steps determine which States the FIP must cover.  The rubber meets the road at steps 3 and 4: How much do sources in those States “significantly contribute” to downwind pollution, and what must they do about it?</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Here is how EPA explains that methodology.  A source “significantly contributes” to downwind pollution if there are cost-effective measures it could implement to reduce its emissions: It must halt those emissions that can be eliminated at a cost “under the cost threshold set by the Agency” for sources in that industry.  <em>EME</em>, 572 U.&nbsp;S., at 518 (upholding this approach).  So the “&nbsp;‘amount’ of pollution” that sources must eliminate is “that amount .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in excess of the emissions control strategies the EPA has deemed cost effective.”  <a aria-label=\"88 FR 36676\" href=\"/rio/citation/88_FR_36676\">88 Fed. Reg. 36676</a>.  EPA calculates for each type of source a “uniform level of NOx emissions control stringency” expressed as a “cost per ton of emissions reduction.”  <em>Id</em>., at 36719.  This cost-effectiveness threshold is based on the point “at which further emissions mitigation strategies become excessively costly on a per-ton basis while also delivering far fewer additional emissions reductions.”  <em>Id</em>., at 36683 (describing this “&nbsp;‘knee in the curve’&nbsp;” analysis).  The plan requires sources in each covered State to reduce their emissions accordingly.<a aria-label=\"reference 6 of Barrett Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-6\" id=\"DISSENT_5-6ref\"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; Crucially, the final rule suggests that EPA calculated cost-effectiveness thresholds based on the likely cost and impact of available emissions-reduction technology given <em>national, industry-wide data</em>.  Contrary to the Court’s speculations, <em>ante</em>, at 12, these thresholds and the FIP’s resulting emissions limits appear not to depend on the number of covered States.  Consider the plan’s approach to power plants (“electric generating units,” or EGUs).  EPA assessed the cost and impact of different NOx mitigation strategies that EGUs could implement.  One strategy was to fully operate “selective catalytic reduction” (SCR) technology.  <a aria-label=\"88 FR 36655\" href=\"/rio/citation/88_FR_36655\">88 Fed. Reg. 36655</a>; see <em>id</em>., at 36720.  EPA estimated that a “representative marginal cost” for this strategy would be $1,600 per ton, and a “reasonable level of performance” would be 0.08 lb/mmBtu—based on “nationwide” power plant “emissions data.”  <em>Id</em>., at 36720–36721.  EPA thus determined that SCR optimization was a “viable mitigation strategy for the 2023 ozone season” and built this assumption into the plan’s emissions limits.  <em>Id</em>., at 36720.  In other words, EPA relied on nationwide industry data to select cost thresholds that corresponded to how much it would cost to use particular emissions-reduction technologies, and it applied that “uniform control stringency to EGUs within the covered upwind states.”  <em>Id</em>., at 36680.<a aria-label=\"reference 7 of Barrett Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-7\" id=\"DISSENT_5-7ref\"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; In fact, some commenters criticized EPA’s reliance on a “nationwide data set” to calculate emissions limits, arguing that EPA should “limit the dataset to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. just the covered states”—an approach that <em>would</em> have made the cost-&nbsp;effectiveness thresholds depend on which States were covered.  <em>Id</em>., at 36723.  But EPA expressly defended its approach based on its “intention to identify a <em>technology-specific </em>representative emissions rate” and its interest in “the performance potential <em>of a technology</em>”—which were best served by the “largest dataset possible (<em>i</em>.<em>e</em>., <em>nationwide</em>).”  <em>Id</em>., at 36723–36724 (emphasis added).  EPA explained that it used the same approach it had successfully applied in previous rulemakings: It “derive[d] technology performance averages” based on nationwide data.  <em>Id</em>., at 36724.  Then it applied the relevant industry standard “on a uniform basis” to each emitter across the covered States.  <em>Id</em>., at 36817.<a aria-label=\"reference 8 of Barrett Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-8\" id=\"DISSENT_5-8ref\"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; The Court, perhaps recognizing the problem that the FIP’s seemingly state-agnostic methodology poses for its theory, throws at the wall a cherry-picked assortment of EPA statements mentioning state data.  See <em>ante</em>, at 5–6, 19, n. 14.  None stick.  The fundamental problem with the Court’s citations is that they discuss analyses that EPA performed <em>after</em> it chose cost thresholds and emissions limits based on nationwide industry data.  EPA did assess the impact on downwind States if particular upwind States met the proposed emissions limits, and that impact depended on the States included in the modeling.  <em>Ante</em>, at 5, 19, n. 14.  But EPA said that these “&nbsp;‘findings regarding air quality improvement,’&nbsp;” <em>ante</em>, at 19, n.&nbsp;14 (quoting <a aria-label=\"88 FR 36741\" href=\"/rio/citation/88_FR_36741\">88 Fed. Reg. 36741</a>), served only to “<em>cement</em> EPA’s identification of the selected .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. mitigation measures as the appropriate control stringency,” <a aria-label=\"88 FR 36741\" href=\"/rio/citation/88_FR_36741\">88 Fed. Reg. 36741</a> (emphasis added); see Denial 18.  EPA explained that the statutory requirement to “eliminate significant contribution” depends on the implementation of cost-effective emissions controls at individual “industrial sources,” <em>not</em> some overall impact on “downwind areas’ nonattainment and maintenance problems.”  <a aria-label=\"88 FR 36741\" href=\"/rio/citation/88_FR_36741\">88 Fed. Reg. 36741</a>.<em> </em>EPA assessed the FIP’s impact assuming the participation of particular States primarily to ensure that its emissions limits did not result in “overcontrol”—<em>i</em>.<em>e</em>., more reductions than necessary to help downwind States comply with the NAAQS.  <em>Ibid.</em>; see <em>EME Homer City</em>, 572 U.&nbsp;S., at 521.  The technical document that the Court cites, <em>ante,</em> at 5, makes this point clear: “The downwind air quality impacts are used to inform EPA’s assessment of potential overcontrol.”  Proposed Ozone Analysis 31. </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> EPA’s analysis confirmed that its chosen emissions limits would not result in overcontrol if they were implemented in the States originally covered by the FIP.  88 Fed. Reg. &nbsp;36741.  Importantly, implementing the FIP “in fewer upwind states does not (and cannot possibly) result in overcontrol” given that “there was no overcontrol even when more states, making more emission reductions, were included.”  Denial 22.  So the fact that EPA used state-specific data in its overcontrol analysis does not mean that the FIP’s emissions limits depended on the number of States it covered.  And the inclusion of fewer States in that analysis logically could not have affected the results.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Thus, EPA generally characterized the FIP’s emissions limits as dependent on nationwide data, not on any particular set of States.<a aria-label=\"reference 9 of Barrett Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-9\" id=\"DISSENT_5-9ref\"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup></a>  Confirming this interpretation, the final rule contemplates its application to a different number of States.  It recognizes that “states may replace FIPs with SIPs if EPA approves them,” and several sections explain how States may exit <em>this</em> FIP.  <a aria-label=\"88 FR 36753\" href=\"/rio/citation/88_FR_36753\">88 Fed. Reg. 36753</a>, 36838–36843.  And the rule’s severability provision explains that EPA views the plan as “severable along .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. state and/or tribal jurisdictional lines.”  <em>Id</em>., at 36693.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Moreover, EPA justified the FIP’s severability: EPA “must address good neighbor obligations as expeditiously as practicable and by no later than the next applicable attainment date”; severability serves “important public health and environmental benefits” and ensures that stakeholders can “rely on this final rule in their planning.”  <em>Ibid</em>.  These &nbsp;rationales align with EPA’s response to critics of its decision to propose a FIP before finalizing its SIP disapprovals: Quickly proposing a FIP—just like keeping the FIP in place even if some States drop out—“is a reasonable and prudent means of assuring that [EPA’s] statutory obligation to reduce air pollution affecting the health and welfare of people in downwind states is implemented without delay.”  Response to Comments 151.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Given these justifications and the state-agnostic methodology apparent in the final rule, EPA’s “&nbsp;‘path may reasonably be discerned.’&nbsp;”  <em>State Farm</em>, 463 U.&nbsp;S., at 43.  The FIP’s cost thresholds and emissions limits did not depend in any significant way on the number of States included, so the drawbacks of severability were minimal.  On the other hand, severability was necessary so that EPA could fulfill, to the greatest extent possible, its statutory obligation to eliminate the significant ozone contributions of upwind States and reduce harmful pollution in downwind States in time to meet the attainment deadlines.  See Response to Comments 150 (noting the August 2024 ozone-NAAQS attainment deadline).  If the FIP were not severable, EPA would have to go back to the drawing board for <em>all </em>States whenever a single State is removed—thwarting its mission for little reason.<a aria-label=\"reference 10 of Barrett Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-10\" id=\"DISSENT_5-10ref\"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Finally, it is unlikely that EPA’s response to comments evinces a “fail[ure] to consider an <em>important</em> aspect of the problem.”  <em>State Farm</em>, 463 U.&nbsp;S., at 43 (emphasis added).  &nbsp;An agency must respond to “&nbsp;‘<em>relevant</em>’ and ‘<em>significant</em>’ public comments,” and that requirement is not “particularly demanding”; the “agency need not respond at all to comments that are ‘purely speculative and do not disclose the factual or policy basis on which they rest.’&nbsp;”  <em>Public Citizen, Inc. </em>v. <em>FAA</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/988_F.2d_186\">988 F.&nbsp;2d 186</a>, 197 (CADC 1993) (quoting <em>Home Box Office, Inc.</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/567_F.2d_9\">567 F.&nbsp;2d 9</a>, 35, and n.&nbsp;58 (CADC 1977); emphasis added); see §7607(d)(6)(B) (EPA must respond to “significant” comments).  EPA received hundreds of comments, and its response numbered nearly 1,100 pages.  Given the likelihood that the FIP’s emissions limits did not depend on the covered States, the risk of it applying to fewer States may not be “important,” and comments purportedly raising that possibility might not be “relevant” and “significant.”  Moreover, the one comment that vaguely referred to a need for a “new assessment and modeling,” Air Stewardship Comments 14, was “purely speculative” and “disclose[d]” no “factual or policy basis”; it likely merited no response, <em>Home Box Office</em>, <a aria-label=\"567 F.2d 35\" href=\"/rio/citation/567_F.2d_35\">567 F.&nbsp;2d, at 35</a>, n.&nbsp;58.  Requiring more from EPA risks the “sort of unwarranted judicial examination of perceived procedural shortcomings” that might “seriously interfere with that process prescribed by Congress.”  <em>Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"435 U. S. 519\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/435/519\">435 U.&nbsp;S. 519</a>, 548 (1978).<a aria-label=\"reference 11 of Barrett Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-11\" id=\"DISSENT_5-11ref\"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">C</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Applicants face one more impediment: the Clean Air Act’s stringent harmless-error rule.  A court “reviewing alleged procedural errors .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. may invalidate [an EPA] rule only if &nbsp;the errors were <em>so serious</em> and related to matters of <em>such central relevance</em> to the rule that there is a <em>substantial</em> <em>likelihood</em> that the rule would have been <em>significantly changed</em> if such errors had not been made.”  §7607(d)(8) (emphasis added).  This provision appears “tailor-made to undo” any “rigid presumption of vacatur” that might apply in other contexts.  N. Bagley, Remedial Restraint in Administrative Law, 117 Colum. L.&nbsp;Rev. 253, 291 (2017).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The alleged error here plausibly is subject to §7607(d)(8)’s harmless-error rule.  As explained above, the Court does not suggest that it is<em> substantively</em> “[un]reasonable” to apply the FIP to fewer States, only that EPA did not “reasonably explai[n]” the FIP’s severability in response to comments.  <em>Prometheus</em>, 592 U.&nbsp;S., at 423. <em> </em>That is arguably an “alleged procedural error” within the meaning of §7607(d)(8).  In fact, the Act contemplates that at least some “arbitrary or capricious” challenges allege failures to “observ[e] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. procedure required by law,” and such challenges may only succeed if §7607(d)(8)’s “condition is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. met.”  §7607(d)(9)(D).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> If the Act’s harmless-error rule applies, applicants are unlikely to prevail.  Given the apparent lack of connection between the number of States covered and the FIP’s methodology for determining cost thresholds and emissions limits, it is difficult to imagine a “substantial” likelihood that the rule would have been “significantly” different had EPA just responded more thoroughly.  In fact, applicants seem to have conceded as much.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 6 (“[W]ith full candor to the Court, [the cost threshold] could be the same or even be more expensive”); <em>id</em>., at 9 (“I can’t tell you what that looks like, whether there is a difference in the obligations or not”).  And EPA, the Court says, had “notice” of the alleged concern that the cost thresholds might change with different States.  <em>Ante</em>, at 15.  Yet EPA <em>still</em> chose to make the FIP severable because of its statutory obligation to reduce downwind pollution—an obligation it repeatedly &nbsp;referenced.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <a aria-label=\"88 FR 36693\" href=\"/rio/citation/88_FR_36693\">88 Fed. Reg. 36693</a>; Response to Comments 149–151.  Would that same EPA have “significantly changed” the FIP had it just explained more thoroughly why the plan did not depend on the States covered?<a aria-label=\"reference 12 of Barrett Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-12\" id=\"DISSENT_5-12ref\"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup></a>  And on top of all this, EPA has in fact refused to reconsider the FIP now that it applies to fewer States, explaining in detail why its methodology was unaffected by the States it covered.<a aria-label=\"reference 13 of Barrett Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-13\" id=\"DISSENT_5-13ref\"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">*  *  *</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> With little to say in response to the FIP’s apparent state-agnostic methodology for setting emissions limits and the Clean Air Act’s stringent harmless-error rule, the Court resorts to raising forfeiture.  <em>Ante</em>, at 17–19.  But it is the Court that goes out of its way to develop a failure-to-explain &nbsp;theory largely absent from applicants’ briefs.  One can search diligently in the hundreds of pages of applicants’ opening briefs for the Court’s theory—that EPA failed to explain in its final rule why the FIP’s cost-effectiveness thresholds for imposing emissions limits do not shift with a different mix of States—and be left wondering where the Court found it.  That theory appears not to have crystallized until oral argument, during which counsel for the state applicants struggled to locate it in the States’ brief.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 11–12.  Consider just one illustrative example.  Given the importance to the Court’s theory of how the “knee in the curve” might change with different States, see <em>ante</em>, at 6, 7, and n.&nbsp;4, 12, one might expect to find some mention of that idea in applicants’ briefs.  One would be wrong.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Given that applicants’ theory has evolved throughout the course of this litigation, we can hardly fault EPA for failing to raise every potentially meritorious defense in its response brief.  That is particularly true given the compressed briefing schedule in this litigation’s emergency posture: The Court gave EPA less than two weeks to respond to multiple applications raising a host of general and industry-specific technical challenges, filed less than a week earlier.  Even still, EPA raised §7607(d)(7)(B)’s procedural bar.  Brief for Respondents 19.  And on the merits, EPA expressly argued that the FIP’s “viability and validity do not depend on the number of jurisdictions it covers”; the “Rule need not apply to any minimum number of States in order to operate coherently.”  <em>Id</em>., at 24.  EPA could also have demonstrated how the FIP’s state-agnostic methodology for selecting cost thresholds was apparent in the final rule.  But EPA cannot have forfeited that more specific point because applicants did not raise it to begin with.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Because EPA did not forfeit these responses to the merits of applicants’ arbitrary-or-capricious challenge, there is no need to consider whether a departure from our typical approach to forfeited arguments is justified.  See <em>ante</em>, at 18.  &nbsp;It remains <em>applicants’ </em>burden to show that the FIP’s alleged dependence on the covered States likely was an “important” problem that EPA “entirely failed to consider.”  <em>State Farm</em>, 463 U.&nbsp;S., at 43.  And that is on top of their burden to overcome §7607(d)(7)(B)’s procedural bar and the lack of “significant,” specific comments raising this issue.  §7607(d)(6)(B).  </p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Finally, I would exercise our discretion to consider §7607(d)(8)’s harmless-error rule.  Even putting aside the expedited briefing schedule and the limited discussion of the Court’s theory in applicants’ briefs, applicants bear the burden in seeking emergency relief to show a <em>likelihood</em> of success on the merits.  In other words, we must <em>predict</em> whether applicants will overcome every barrier to relief at the end of the day, after full merits briefing and argument in the lower courts and, potentially, again in this Court.  Section 7607(d)(8)’s harmless-error rule is one such important obstacle, and EPA has already signaled that it will raise it as litigation progresses.  See Denial 35, n. 38 (arguing that any failure to more fully explain “how the Rule is not interdependent” is harmless error under §7607(d)(8)).  I see no reason not to consider it now.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">III</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Given the emergency posture of this litigation, my views on the merits of the failure-to-explain objection and the&nbsp;application of the Clean Air Act’s procedural bar and&nbsp;harmless-error rule are tentative.  But even a tentative adverse conclusion can undermine applicants’ likelihood of success.  And applicants, to prevail, must run the table; they face the daunting task of surmounting <em>all</em> of these significant obstacles.  They are unlikely to succeed.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Court, seizing on a barely briefed failure-to-explain theory, grants relief anyway.  It enjoins the Good Neighbor Plan’s enforcement against any state or industry applicant pending review in the D.&nbsp;C. Circuit and any petition for cer&nbsp;tiorari.  <em>Ante</em>, at 19.  Given the number of companies included and the timelines for review, the Court’s injunction leaves large swaths of upwind States free to keep contributing significantly to their downwind neighbors’ ozone problems for the next several years—even though the temporarily stayed SIP disapprovals may all be upheld and the FIP may yet cover all the original States.  The Court justifies this decision based on an alleged procedural error that likely had no impact on the plan.  So its theory would require EPA only to confirm what we already know: EPA would have promulgated the same plan even if fewer States were covered.  Rather than require this years-long exercise in futility, the equities counsel restraint.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Our emergency docket requires us to evaluate quickly the merits of applications without the benefit of full briefing and reasoned lower court opinions.  See <em>Does 1–3</em>, 595 U.&nbsp;S., at ___ (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Barrett</span>, J.).  Given those limitations, we should proceed all the more cautiously in cases like this one with voluminous, technical records and thorny legal questions.

But in reality, it is the Court that ignores how the FIP works.

But as explained above, the comment itself said nothing about States dropping out of the final plan or the possible impact of different numbers of States on the FIP’s cost thresholds or emissions limits.  It is hard to believe that a single sentence with no elaboration or explanation of the potential issue—in a sea of thousands of pages of comments—gave EPA reasonable notice that it should have included in its final rule a detailed explanation of why the FIP’s emissions limits did not depend on the number of States.  Cf.<em> Public Citizen, Inc. </em>v. <em>FAA</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/988_F.2d_186\">988 F.&nbsp;2d 186</a>, 197 (CADC 1993) (An “agency need not respond at all to comments that are ‘purely speculative and do not disclose the factual or policy basis on which they rest’&nbsp;”).</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_5-6\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Barrett Dissent at reference 6\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-6ref\">6</a> &nbsp;For power plants, EPA implements these requirements by allocating each State an “&nbsp;‘emissions budget’ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. representing the EPA’s quantification of the emissions that would remain” if plants in that State eliminated all the emissions that EPA determines can be eliminated for less than the cost threshold.  <a aria-label=\"88 FR 36762\" href=\"/rio/citation/88_FR_36762\">88 Fed. Reg. 36762</a>.  EPA then allocates tradeable “&nbsp;‘allowances’&nbsp;” proportionally among the State’s sources, creating a marketplace for emissions.  <em>Ibid</em>.  With respect to other sources, EPA determined that nine industries in the covered States produced the most significant emissions.  <em>Id</em>., at 36817.  The rule requires sources in each of those industries to meet specific emissions limits that were calculated based on the reductions that they can cost-effectively achieve.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_5-7\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Barrett Dissent at reference 7\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-7ref\">7</a> &nbsp;EPA ultimately selected (based on nationwide data) a cost threshold of $1,800 per ton of NOx reduction that would apply in earlier years, and a cost threshold of $11,000 per ton that would apply in later years.  <a aria-label=\"88 FR 36749\" href=\"/rio/citation/88_FR_36749\">88 Fed. Reg. 36749</a>, 36846.  These cost thresholds corresponded to the cost of different emissions-control measures: For example, EGUs can “retrofi[t&nbsp;] state-of-the-art combustion controls” and “[o]ptimiz[e] idled SCRs” for less than $1,800 per ton, and they can “instal[l&nbsp; new] SCRs” for less than $11,000 per ton.  Ozone Transport Policy Analysis Final Rule TSD 5 (EPA–HQ–OAR–2021–0668–1080, Mar. 2023) (Final Ozone Analysis).  EPA then calculated each State’s emissions budget based on the assumption that the State’s EGUs would implement the emissions-reductions strategies that cost less than the chosen thresholds.  See n.&nbsp;6, <em>supra</em>; <a aria-label=\"88 FR 36762\" href=\"/rio/citation/88_FR_36762\">88 Fed. Reg. 36762</a>; Final Ozone Analysis 6, 9.  Given the likelihood that EPA selected cost thresholds based on nationwide data, each State’s budget would be the same even if the FIP covered different States.   </p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_5-8\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Barrett Dissent at reference 8\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-8ref\">8</a> &nbsp;While EPA’s methodology with respect to other industrial sources (non-EGUs) was more complicated, it also seems to have relied on nationwide data.  EPA chose a “$7,500 marginal cost-per-ton threshold,” <a aria-label=\"88 FR 36740\" href=\"/rio/citation/88_FR_36740\">88 Fed. Reg. 36740</a>, which corresponded to the point of diminishing returns (the “knee in the curve”) when EPA assessed the impact of emissions controls in the highest impact industries and in “all industries” on the total “ozone season NOx reduction potential,” Technical Memorandum, Screening Assessment of Potential Emissions Reductions, Air Quality Impacts, and Costs From Non-EGU Emissions Units for 2026, p. 4, (EPA–HQ–OAR–2021–0668–150, Feb. 2022) (boldface omitted).  This figure thus appears to have been determined based on industry-wide cost and emissions data rather than state-specific calculations.  So too with the specific emissions limits EPA decided could be implemented for less than that cost.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <a aria-label=\"88 FR 36825\" href=\"/rio/citation/88_FR_36825\">88 Fed. Reg. 36825</a> (“EPA based the proposed emissions limits for cement kilns on the types of limits being met across the nation”).</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_5-9\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Barrett Dissent at reference 9\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-9ref\">9</a> &nbsp;The Court argues that EPA equated the framework it used here with the one that we described in <em>EME Homer City</em>.  <em>Ante</em>, at 18, and n.&nbsp;13.  But even if <em>EME </em>described an<em> </em>approach that selected cost thresholds “only after” conducting downwind air-quality assessments, <em>ibid.</em>,<em> </em>it is not clear that the Good Neighbor Plan adopted <em>this</em> aspect of the <em>EME </em>framework.  In fact, there are other key similarities between this FIP and <em>EME</em>’s<em> </em>approach.  For example, the final FIP refers to <em>EME </em>in order to note that EPA’s “uniform framework of policy judgments”—<em>i</em>.<em>e</em>., applying the same cost thresholds with “[n]ationwide consistency”—was upheld in that case.  <a aria-label=\"88 FR 36673\" href=\"/rio/citation/88_FR_36673\">88 Fed. Reg. 36673</a>.  And the final FIP identifies cost thresholds that EPA chose based on nationwide data—like $1,800 based on the cost of EGUs “optimiz[ing] . . . existing SCRs and SNCRs.”  <em>Id</em>., at<em> </em>36749.    </p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_5-10\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Barrett Dissent at reference 10\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-10ref\">10</a> &nbsp;The Court claims that the severability clause is evidence that EPA “had notice of the objection the applicants seek to press in court,” yet EPA’s justifications for it did not address (alleged) concerns about how the cost-effectiveness thresholds would change with fewer States.  <em>Ante</em>, at 15–16.  But as explained above, commenters did not raise that issue with specificity; they simply pointed out that some SIP disapprovals might be invalid.  The severability clause is evidence that EPA was aware of <em>that </em>possibility, and the clause was EPA’s response to it.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_5-11\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Barrett Dissent at reference 11\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-11ref\">11</a> &nbsp;Despite the Court’s suggestion of forfeiture, <em>ante</em>, at 17, EPA could not have forfeited the argument that the comments the Court cites were too insubstantial to merit a response.  The Court relies on comments that were not raised until the applicants’ reply briefs or that were uncovered later by the Court itself.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., Reply Brief in No. 23A351, p. 11 (raising the Air Stewardship Coalition “modeling” comment for the first time).</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_5-12\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Barrett Dissent at reference 12\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-12ref\">12</a> &nbsp;The Court faults EPA for “refus[ing] to say with certainty” at oral argument that it would have reached the same conclusions if different States were included in the FIP.  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  But §7607(d)(8) does not require the Government to show that the rule would be the same; it is most naturally read to require the challenger to demonstrate a “substantial likelihood that the rule <em>would have been significantly changed</em> if such errors had not been made.”  (Emphasis added.)  And though §7607(d)(9)(A) appears to allow reversal of “&nbsp;‘any’&nbsp;” arbitrary or capricious “&nbsp;‘action,’&nbsp;” <em>ante</em>, at 19, §7607(d)(8)’s more specific harmless-error rule and §7607(d)(9)(D)’s more specific requirements for reversal based on arbitrary or capricious procedural errors would seem to control.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_5-13\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Barrett Dissent at reference 13\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_5-13ref\">13</a> &nbsp;The Court claims that the Clean Air Act prevents us from considering EPA’s denial of reconsideration.  <em>Ante</em>, at 14–15, n.&nbsp;11.  But it is not obvious that the relevant provision of the Act—§7607(d)(7)(A)’s definition of the “record for judicial review”—bars consideration of later developments for purposes of the Act’s stringent harmless-error rule, §7607(d)(8).  Even assuming that the denial of reconsideration <em>itself</em> cannot count as evidence of harmlessness, we are judging applicants’ <em>likelihood</em> of success on the merits.  On the merits, we can expect EPA to make just the sort of arguments it made in its denial: EPA likely will explain why the covered States did not matter by citing and interpreting material in the record.

Under the <em>Chevron</em> doctrine, courts have sometimes been required to defer to “permissible” agency interpretations of the statutes those agencies administer—even when a reviewing court reads the statute differently.  <em>Id.</em>, at 843.

Pp. 7–35.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">  (a)&nbsp;Article III of the Constitution assigns to the Federal Judiciary the responsibility and power to adjudicate “Cases” and “Controversies”—concrete disputes with consequences for the parties involved.  The Framers appreciated that the laws judges would necessarily apply in resolving those disputes would not always be clear, but envisioned &nbsp;that the final “interpretation of the laws” would be “the proper and peculiar province of the courts.”  The Federalist No.&nbsp;78, p. 525 (A. Hamilton).  As Chief Justice Marshall declared in the foundational decision of <em>Marbury </em>v. <em>Madison</em>, “[i]t is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.”  1 Cranch 137, 177.  In the decades following <em>Marbury</em>,<em> </em>when the meaning of a statute was at issue, the judicial role was to “interpret the act of Congress, in order to ascertain the rights of the parties.”  <em>Decatur</em> v. <em>Paulding</em>, 14 Pet. 497, 515.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">  The Court recognized from the outset, though, that exercising independent judgment often included according due respect to Executive Branch interpretations of federal statutes.  Such respect was thought especially warranted when an Executive Branch interpretation was issued roughly contemporaneously with enactment of the statute and remained consistent over time.  The Court also gave “the most respectful consideration” to Executive Branch interpretations simply because “[t]he officers concerned [were] usually able men, and masters of the subject,” who may well have drafted the laws at issue.  <em>United States </em>v. <em>Moore</em>, <a aria-label=\"95 U. S. 760\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/95/760\">95 U.&nbsp;S. 760</a>, 763.  “Respect,” though, was just that.  The views of the Executive Branch could inform the judgment of the Judiciary, but did not supersede it.  “[I]n cases where [a court’s] own judgment .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. differ[ed] from that of other high functionaries,” the court was “not at liberty to surrender, or to waive it.”  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Dickson</em>, 15 Pet. 141, 162<em>.</em></p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">  During the “rapid expansion of the administrative process” that took place during the New Deal era, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Morton Salt Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"338 U. S. 632\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/338/632\">338 U.&nbsp;S. 632</a>, 644, the Court often treated agency determinations of <em>fact</em> as binding on the courts, provided that there was “evidence to support the findings,” <em>St. Joseph Stock Yards Co.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"298 U. S. 38\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/298/38\">298 U.&nbsp;S. 38</a>, 51.  But the Court did not extend similar deference to agency resolutions of questions of <em>law</em>.  “The interpretation of the meaning of statutes, as applied to justiciable controversies,” remained “exclusively a judicial function.”  <em>United States</em> v. <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"310 U. S. 534\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/310/534\">310 U.&nbsp;S. 534</a>, 544.  The Court also continued to note that the informed judgment of the Executive Branch could be entitled to “great weight.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 549.  “The weight of such a judgment in a particular case,” the Court observed, would “depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control.”  <em>Skidmore</em> v. <em>Swift &amp; Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"323 U. S. 134\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/323/134\">323 U.&nbsp;S. 134</a>, 140.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">  Occasionally during this period, the Court applied deferential review after concluding that a particular statute empowered an agency to decide how a broad statutory term applied to specific facts found by &nbsp;the agency.  See <em>Gray</em> v. <em>Powell</em>, <a aria-label=\"314 U. S. 402\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/314/402\">314 U.&nbsp;S. 402</a>; <em>NLRB</em> v. <em>Hearst Publications, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"322 U. S. 111\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/322/111\">322 U.&nbsp;S. 111</a>.  But such deferential review, which the Court was far from consistent in applying, was cabined to factbound determinations.  And the Court did not purport to refashion the longstanding judicial approach to questions of law.  It instead proclaimed that “[u]ndoubtedly questions of statutory interpretation .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. are for the courts to resolve, giving appropriate weight to the judgment of those whose special duty is to administer the questioned statute.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 130–131.  Nothing in the New Deal era or before it thus resembled the deference rule the Court would begin applying decades later to all varieties of agency interpretations of statutes under <em>Chevron</em>.  Pp. 7–13.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">  (b)&nbsp;Congress in 1946 enacted the APA “as a check upon administrators whose zeal might otherwise have carried them to excesses not contemplated in legislation creating their offices.”  <em>Morton Salt</em>, 338 U.&nbsp;S., at 644.  The APA prescribes procedures for agency action and delineates the basic contours of judicial review of such action.  And it codifies for agency cases the unremarkable, yet elemental proposition reflected by judicial practice dating back to <em>Marbury</em>: that courts decide legal questions by applying their own judgment.  As relevant here, the APA specifies that courts, not agencies, will decide “<em>all</em> relevant questions of law” arising on review of agency action, <a aria-label=\"5 USC 706\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/706\">5 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §706</a> (emphasis added)—even those involving ambiguous laws.  It prescribes no deferential standard for courts to employ in answering those legal questions, despite mandating deferential judicial review of agency policymaking and factfinding.  See §§706(2)(A), (E).  And by directing courts to “interpret constitutional and statutory provisions” without differentiating between the two, §706, it makes clear that agency interpretations of statutes—like agency interpretations of the Constitution—are <em>not</em> entitled to deference.  The APA’s history and the contemporaneous views of various respected commentators underscore the plain meaning of its text.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">  Courts exercising independent judgment in determining the meaning of statutory provisions, consistent with the APA, may—as they have from the start—seek aid from the interpretations of those responsible for implementing particular statutes.  See <em>Skidmore</em>, 323 U.&nbsp;S., at 140.  And when the best reading of a statute is that it delegates discretionary authority to an agency, the role of the reviewing court under the APA is, as always, to independently interpret the statute and effectuate the will of Congress subject to constitutional limits.  The court fulfills that role by recognizing constitutional delegations, fixing the boundaries of the delegated authority, and ensuring the agency has engaged in “&nbsp;‘reasoned decisionmaking’&nbsp;” within those boundaries.  <em>Michigan</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, <a aria-label=\"576 U. S. 743\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/576/743\">576 U.&nbsp;S. 743</a>, 750 (quoting <em>Allentown Mack Sales &amp; Service, Inc.</em> v. <em>NLRB</em>, <a aria-label=\"522 U. S. 359\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/522/359\">522 U.&nbsp;S. 359</a>, 374).  By doing so, a court upholds the traditional conception of the judicial function that the APA adopts.  Pp. 13–18.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">  (c) The deference that <em>Chevron </em>requires of courts reviewing agency action cannot be squared with the APA.  Pp. 18–29.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">   (1)&nbsp;<em>Chevron</em>, decided in 1984 by a bare quorum of six Justices, triggered a marked departure from the traditional judicial approach of independently examining each statute to determine its meaning.  The question in the case was whether an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation was consistent with the term “stationary source” as used in the Clean Air Act.  467 U.&nbsp;S., at 840.  To answer that question, the Court articulated and employed a now familiar two-step approach broadly applicable to review of agency action.  The first step was to discern “whether Congress ha[d] directly spoken to the precise question at issue.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 842.   The Court explained that “[i]f the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter,” <em>ibid.</em>, and courts were therefore to “reject administrative constructions which are contrary to clear congressional intent,” <em>id.</em>, at 843, n.&nbsp;9.  But in a case in which “the statute [was] silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue” at hand, a reviewing court could not “simply impose its own construction on the statute, as would be necessary in the absence of an administrative interpretation.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 843 (footnote omitted)<em>.</em>  Instead, at <em>Chevron</em>’s second step, a court had to defer to the agency if it had offered “a permissible construction of the statute,” <em>ibid.</em>, even if not “the reading the court would have reached if the question initially had arisen in a judicial proceeding,” <em>ibid.</em>, n.&nbsp;11.  Employing this new test, the Court concluded that Congress had not addressed the question at issue with the necessary “level of specificity” and that EPA’s interpretation was “entitled to deference.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 865.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">  Although the Court did not at first treat <em>Chevron </em>as the watershed decision it was fated to become, the Court and the courts of appeals were soon routinely invoking its<em> </em>framework as the governing standard in cases involving statutory questions of agency authority.  The Court eventually decided that <em>Chevron</em> rested on “a presumption that Congress, when it left ambiguity in a statute meant for implementation by an agency, understood that the ambiguity would be resolved, first and foremost, by the agency, and desired the agency (rather than the courts) to possess whatever degree of discretion the ambiguity allows.”  <em>Smiley</em> v. <em>Citibank (South Dakota), N.&nbsp;A.</em>, <a aria-label=\"517 U. S. 735\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/517/735\">517 U.&nbsp;S. 735</a>, 740–741.  Pp. 18–20.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">   (2)&nbsp;Neither <em>Chevron</em> nor any subsequent decision of the Court attempted to reconcile its framework with the APA.  <em>Chevron</em> defies the command of the APA that “the reviewing court”—not the agency whose &nbsp;action it reviews—is to “decide <em>all</em> relevant questions of law” and “interpret .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. statutory provisions.”  §706 (emphasis added).  It requires a court to <em>ignore</em>, not follow, “the reading the court would have reached” had it exercised its independent judgment as required by the APA.  <em>Chevron</em>, 467 U.&nbsp;S., at 843, n.&nbsp;11.  <em>Chevron</em> insists on more than the “respect” historically given to Executive Branch interpretations; it demands that courts mechanically afford <em>binding </em>deference to agency interpretations, including those that have been inconsistent over time, see <em>id.</em>, at 863, and even when a pre-existing judicial precedent holds that an ambiguous statute means something else, <em>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn.</em> v. <em>Brand X Internet Services</em>, <a aria-label=\"545 U. S. 967\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/545/967\">545 U.&nbsp;S. 967</a>, 982.  That regime is the antithesis of the time honored approach the APA prescribes.  </p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">  <em>Chevron </em>cannot be reconciled with the APA by presuming that statutory ambiguities are implicit delegations to agencies.  That<em> </em>presumption does not approximate reality.  A statutory ambiguity does not necessarily reflect a congressional intent that an agency, as opposed to a court, resolve the resulting interpretive question.  Many or perhaps most statutory ambiguities may be unintentional.  And when courts confront statutory ambiguities in cases that do not involve agency interpretations or delegations of authority, they are not somehow relieved of their obligation to independently interpret the statutes.  Instead of declaring a particular party’s reading “permissible” in such a case, courts use every tool at their disposal to determine the best reading of the statute and resolve the ambiguity.  But in an agency case as in any other, there is a best reading all the same—“the reading the court would have reached” if no agency were involved.  <em>Chevron</em>, 467 U.&nbsp;S., at 843, n.&nbsp;11.  It therefore makes no sense to speak of a “permissible” interpretation that is not the one the court, after applying all relevant interpretive tools, concludes is best.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">  Perhaps most fundamentally, <em>Chevron</em>’s presumption is misguided because<em> </em>agencies have no special competence in resolving statutory ambiguities.  Courts do.  The Framers anticipated that courts would often confront statutory ambiguities and expected that courts would resolve them by exercising independent legal judgment.  <em>Chevron</em> gravely erred in concluding that the inquiry is fundamentally different just because an administrative interpretation is in play.  The very point of the traditional tools of statutory construction is to resolve statutory ambiguities.  That is no less true when the ambiguity is about the scope of an agency’s own power—perhaps the occasion on which abdication in favor of the agency is <em>least</em> appropriate.  Pp. 21–23.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">   (3)&nbsp;The Government responds that Congress must generally intend for agencies to resolve statutory ambiguities because agencies have subject matter expertise regarding the statutes they administer; &nbsp;because deferring to agencies purportedly promotes the uniform construction of federal law; and because resolving statutory ambiguities can involve policymaking best left to political actors, rather than courts.  See Brief for Respondents in No. 22–1219, pp. 16–19.  But none of these considerations justifies <em>Chevron</em>’s sweeping presumption of congressional intent.  </p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">  As the Court recently noted, interpretive issues arising in connection with a regulatory scheme “may fall more naturally into a judge’s bailiwick” than an agency’s.  <em>Kisor</em> v. <em>Wilkie</em>, <a aria-label=\"588 U. S. 558\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/588/558\">588 U.&nbsp;S. 558</a>, 578.  Under <em>Chevron</em>’s broad rule of deference, though, ambiguities of all stripes trigger deference, even in cases having little to do with an agency’s technical subject matter expertise.  And even when an ambiguity happens to implicate a technical matter, it does not follow that Congress has taken the power to authoritatively interpret the statute from the courts and given it to the agency.  Congress expects courts to handle technical statutory questions, and courts did so without issue in agency cases before <em>Chevron</em>.  After all, in an agency case in particular, the reviewing court will go about its task with the agency’s “body of experience and informed judgment,” among other information, at its disposal.  <em>Skidmore</em>, 323 U.&nbsp;S., at 140.  An agency’s interpretation of a statute “cannot bind a court,” but may be especially informative “to the extent it rests on factual premises within [the agency’s] expertise.”  <em>Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms</em> v. <em>FLRA</em>, <a aria-label=\"464 U. S. 89\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/464/89\">464 U.&nbsp;S. 89</a>, 98, n.&nbsp;8.  Delegating ultimate interpretive authority to agencies is simply not necessary to ensure that the resolution of statutory ambiguities is well informed by subject matter expertise.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">  Nor does a desire for the uniform construction of federal law justify <em>Chevron</em>.  It is unclear how much the <em>Chevron </em>doctrine as a whole actually promotes such uniformity, and in any event, we see no reason to presume that Congress prefers uniformity for uniformity’s sake over the correct interpretation of the laws it enacts.  </p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">  Finally, the view that interpretation of ambiguous statutory provisions amounts to policymaking suited for political actors rather than courts is especially mistaken because it rests on a profound misconception of the judicial role.  Resolution of statutory ambiguities involves legal interpretation, and that task does not suddenly become policymaking just because a court has an “agency to fall back on.”  <em>Kisor</em>, 588 U.&nbsp;S., at 575.  Courts interpret statutes, no matter the context, based on the traditional tools of statutory construction, not individual policy preferences.  To stay out of discretionary policymaking left to the political branches, judges need only fulfill their obligations under the APA to independently identify and respect such delegations of authority, police the outer statutory boundaries of those delegations, and ensure that agencies exercise their discretion consistent with the APA.  &nbsp;By forcing courts to instead pretend that ambiguities are necessarily delegations, <em>Chevron</em> prevents judges from judging.  Pp. 23–26.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">   (4)&nbsp;Because <em>Chevron</em>’s justifying presumption is, as Members of the Court have often recognized, a fiction, the Court has spent the better part of four decades imposing one limitation on <em>Chevron </em>after another.  Confronted with the byzantine set of preconditions and exceptions that has resulted, some courts have simply bypassed <em>Chevron</em> or failed to heed its various steps and nuances.  The Court, for its part, has not deferred to an agency interpretation under <em>Chevron</em> since 2016.  But because <em>Chevron</em> remains on the books, litigants must continue to wrestle with it, and lower courts—bound by even the Court’s crumbling precedents—understandably continue to apply it.  At best, <em>Chevron</em> has been a distraction from the question that matters: Does the statute authorize the challenged agency action?  And at worst, it has required courts to violate the APA by yielding to an agency the express responsibility, vested in “the reviewing <em>court</em>,” to “decide all relevant questions of law” and “interpret .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. statutory provisions.”  §706 (emphasis added).  Pp. 26–29.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">  (d)&nbsp;<em>Stare decisis</em>, the doctrine governing judicial adherence to precedent, does not require the Court to persist in the <em>Chevron </em>project.  The <em>stare decisis</em> considerations most relevant here—“the quality of [the precedent’s] reasoning, the workability of the rule it established, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and reliance on the decision,” <em>Knick </em>v. <em>Township of Scott</em>, <a aria-label=\"588 U. S. 180\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/588/180\">588 U.&nbsp;S. 180</a>, 203 (quoting <em>Janus</em> v. <em>State, County, and Municipal Employees</em>, <a aria-label=\"585 U. S. 878\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/585/878\">585 U.&nbsp;S. 878</a>, 917)—all weigh in favor of letting <em>Chevron </em>go.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">  <em>Chevron</em> has proved to be fundamentally misguided.  It reshaped judicial review of agency action without grappling with the APA, the statute that lays out how such review works.  And its flaws were apparent from the start, prompting the Court to revise its foundations and continually limit its application.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">  Experience has also shown that <em>Chevron</em> is unworkable.  The defining feature of its framework is the identification of statutory ambiguity, but the concept of ambiguity has always evaded meaningful definition.  Such an impressionistic and malleable concept “cannot stand as an every-day test for allocating” interpretive authority between courts and agencies.  <em>Swift &amp; Co.</em> v. <em>Wickham</em>, <a aria-label=\"382 U. S. 111\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/382/111\">382 U.&nbsp;S. 111</a>, 125.  The Court has also been forced to clarify the doctrine again and again, only adding to <em>Chevron</em>’s unworkability, and the doctrine continues to spawn difficult threshold questions that promise to further complicate the inquiry should <em>Chevron</em> be retained.  And its continuing import is far from clear, as courts have often declined to engage with the doctrine, saying it makes no difference.  </p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">  Nor has <em>Chevron</em> fostered meaningful reliance.  Given the Court’s constant tinkering with and eventual turn away from <em>Chevron</em>, it is &nbsp;hard to see how anyone could reasonably expect a court to rely on <em>Chevron</em> in any particular case or expect it to produce readily foreseeable outcomes.  And rather than safeguarding reliance interests, <em>Chevron</em> affirmatively destroys them by allowing agencies to change course even when Congress has given them no power to do so.  </p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both\">  The only way to “ensure that the law will not merely change erratically, but will develop in a principled and intelligible fashion,” <em>Vasquez</em> v. <em>Hillery</em>, <a aria-label=\"474 U. S. 254\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/474/254\">474 U.&nbsp;S. 254</a>, 265, is for the Court to leave <em>Chevron </em>behind.  By overruling <em>Chevron</em>, though, the Court does not call into question prior cases that relied on the <em>Chevron</em> framework.  The holdings of those cases that specific agency actions are lawful—including the Clean Air Act holding of <em>Chevron </em>itself—are still subject to statutory <em>stare decisis</em> despite the Court’s change in interpretive methodology.  See <em>CBOCS West, Inc.</em> v. <em>Humphries</em>, <a aria-label=\"553 U. S. 442\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/553/442\">553 U.&nbsp;S. 442</a>, 457.  Mere reliance on <em>Chevron</em> cannot constitute a “&nbsp;‘special justification’&nbsp;” for overruling such a  holding.  <em>Halliburton Co.</em> v. <em>Erica P. John Fund, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"573 U.

Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"467 U.S. 837\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/467/837\">467 U.&nbsp;S. 837 (1984)</a>, we have sometimes required courts to defer to “permissible” agency interpretations of the statutes those agencies administer—even when a reviewing court reads the statute differently.  In these cases we consider whether that doctrine should be overruled.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">I</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Our <em>Chevron</em> doctrine requires courts to use a two-step &nbsp;framework to interpret statutes administered by federal agencies.  After determining that a case satisfies the various preconditions we have set for <em>Chevron</em> to apply, a reviewing court must first assess “whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 842.  If, and only if, congressional intent is “clear,” that is the end of the inquiry.  <em>Ibid. </em> But if the court determines that “the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue” at hand, the court must, at <em>Chevron</em>’s second step, defer to the agency’s interpretation if it “is based on a permissible construction of the statute.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 843.  The reviewing courts in each of the cases before us applied <em>Chevron</em>’s<em> </em>framework to resolve in favor of the Government challenges to the same agency rule.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">A</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Before 1976, unregulated foreign vessels dominated fishing in the international waters off the U.&nbsp;S. coast, which began just 12 nautical miles offshore.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, S. Rep. &nbsp;No. 94–459, pp.&nbsp;2–3 (1975).  Recognizing the resultant overfishing and the need for sound management of fishery resources, Congress enacted the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA).  See <a href=\"/rio/citation/90_Stat._331\">90 Stat. 331</a> (codified as amended at <a aria-label=\"16 USC 1801\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/1801\">16 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §1801</a> <em>et&nbsp;seq</em>.).  The MSA and subsequent amendments extended the jurisdiction of the United States to 200 nautical miles beyond the U.&nbsp;S. territorial sea and claimed “exclusive fishery management authority over all fish” within that area, known as the “exclusive economic zone.”  §1811(a); see Presidential Proclamation No. 5030, <a aria-label=\"3 CFR\" href=\"/cfr/text/3\">3</a> CFR 22 (1983 Comp.); §§101, 102, <a href=\"/rio/citation/90_Stat._336\">90 Stat. 336</a>.  The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) administers the MSA under a delegation from the Secretary of Commerce.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The MSA established eight regional fishery management councils composed of representatives from the coastal States, fishery stakeholders, and NMFS.  See <a aria-label=\"16 U. S. C.\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16\">16 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C.</a> &nbsp;§§1852(a), (b).  The councils develop fishery management plans, which NMFS approves and promulgates as final regulations.  See §§1852(h), 1854(a).  In service of the statute’s fishery conservation and management goals, see §1851(a), the MSA requires that certain provisions—such as “a mechanism for specifying annual catch limits .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at a level such that overfishing does not occur,” §1853(a)(15)—be included in these plans, see §1853(a).  The plans may also include additional discretionary provisions.  See §1853(b).  For example, plans may “prohibit, limit, condition, or require the use of specified types and quantities of fishing gear, fishing vessels, or equipment,” §1853(b)(4); “reserve a portion of the allowable biological catch of the fishery for use in scientific research,” §1853(b)(11); and “prescribe such other measures, requirements, or conditions and restrictions as are determined to be necessary and appropriate for the conservation and management of the fishery,” §1853(b)(14).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Relevant here, a plan may also require that “one or more observers be carried on board” domestic vessels “for the purpose of collecting data necessary for the conservation and management of the fishery.”  §1853(b)(8).  The MSA specifies three groups that must cover costs associated with observers: (1) foreign fishing vessels operating within the exclusive economic zone (which <em>must</em> carry observers), see §§1821(h)(1)(A), (h)(4), (h)(6); (2) vessels participating in certain limited access privilege programs, which impose quotas permitting fishermen to harvest only specific quantities of a fishery’s total allowable catch, see §§1802(26), 1853a(c)(1)(H), (e)(2), 1854(d)(2); and (3) vessels within the jurisdiction of the North Pacific Council, where many of the largest and most successful commercial fishing enterprises in the Nation operate, see §1862(a).  In the latter two cases, the MSA expressly caps the relevant fees at two or three percent of the value of fish harvested on the vessels.  See §§1854(d)(2)(B), 1862(b)(2)(E).  And in general, it author&nbsp;izes the Secretary to impose “sanctions” when “any payment required for observer services provided to or contracted by an owner or operator .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. has not been paid.”  §1858(g)(1)(D).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The MSA does not contain similar terms addressing whether Atlantic herring fishermen may be required to bear costs associated with any observers a plan may mandate.  And at one point, NMFS fully funded the observer coverage the New England Fishery Management Council required in its plan for the Atlantic herring fishery.  See <a aria-label=\"79 FR 8792\" href=\"/rio/citation/79_FR_8792\">79 Fed. Reg. 8792</a> (2014).  In 2013, however, the council proposed amending its fishery management plans to empower it to require fishermen to pay for observers if federal funding became unavailable.  Several years later, NMFS promulgated a rule approving the amendment.  See <a aria-label=\"85 FR 7414\" href=\"/rio/citation/85_FR_7414\">85 Fed. Reg. 7414</a> (2020).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> With respect to the Atlantic herring fishery, the Rule created an industry funded program that aims to ensure observer coverage on 50 percent of trips undertaken by vessels with certain types of permits.  Under that program, vessel representatives must “declare into” a fishery before beginning a trip by notifying NMFS of the trip and announcing the species the vessel intends to harvest.  If NMFS determines that an observer is required, but declines to assign a Government-paid one, the vessel must contract with and pay for a Government-certified third-party observer.  NMFS estimated that the cost of such an observer would be up to $710 per day, reducing annual returns to the vessel owner by up to 20 percent.  See <em>id.</em>, at 7417–7418.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Petitioners Loper Bright Enterprises, Inc., H&amp;L Axelsson, Inc., Lund Marr Trawlers LLC, and Scombrus One LLC are family businesses that operate in the Atlantic herring fishery.  In February 2020, they challenged the Rule under the MSA, <a aria-label=\"16 USC 1855\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/1855\">16 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §1855</a>(f&nbsp;), which incorporates &nbsp;the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), <a aria-label=\"5 USC 551\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/551\">5 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §551</a> <em>et&nbsp;seq.</em>  In relevant part, they argued that the MSA does not authorize NMFS to mandate that they pay for observers required by a fishery management plan.  The District Court granted summary judgment to the Government.  It concluded that the MSA authorized the Rule, but noted that even if these petitioners’ “arguments were enough to raise an ambiguity in the statutory text,” deference to the agency’s interpretation would be warranted under <em>Chevron</em>.  544 F.&nbsp;Supp.&nbsp;3d 82, 107 (DC 2021); see <em>id.</em>, at 103–107.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> A divided panel of the D.&nbsp;C. Circuit affirmed.  See 45 F.&nbsp;4th 359 (2022).  The majority addressed various provisions of the MSA and concluded that it was not “wholly unambiguous” whether NMFS may require Atlantic herring fishermen to pay for observers.  <em>Id.</em>, at 366.  Because there remained “some question” as to Congress’s intent, <em>id.</em>, at 369, the court proceeded to <em>Chevron</em>’s second step and deferred to the agency’s interpretation as a “reasonable” construction of the MSA, 45 F.&nbsp;4th, at 370.  In dissent, Judge Walker concluded that Congress’s silence on industry funded observers for the Atlantic herring fishery—coupled with the express provision for such observers in other fisheries and on foreign vessels—unambiguously indicated that NMFS lacked the authority to “require [Atlantic herring] fishermen to pay the wages of at-sea monitors.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 375.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">C</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Petitioners Relentless Inc., Huntress Inc., and Seafreeze Fleet LLC own two vessels that operate in the Atlantic herring fishery: the F/V <em>Relentless</em> and the F/V <em>Persistence</em>.<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Roberts Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-1\" id=\"OPINION_4-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a>  These vessels use small-mesh bottom-trawl gear and can freeze fish at sea, so they can catch more species of fish and take longer trips than other vessels (about 10 to 14 days, as &nbsp;opposed to the more typical 2 to 4).  As a result, they generally declare into multiple fisheries per trip so they can catch whatever the ocean offers up.  If the vessels declare into the Atlantic herring fishery for a particular trip, they must carry an observer for that trip if NMFS selects the trip for coverage, even if they end up harvesting fewer herring than other vessels—or no herring at all.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This set of petitioners, like those in the D.&nbsp;C. Circuit case, filed a suit challenging the Rule as unauthorized by the MSA.  The District Court, like the D.&nbsp;C. Circuit, deferred to NMFS’s contrary interpretation under <em>Chevron</em> and thus granted summary judgment to the Government.  See 561 F.&nbsp;Supp. 3d&nbsp;226, 234–238 (RI 2021).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The First Circuit affirmed.  See 62 F.&nbsp;4th 621 (2023).  It relied on a “default norm” that regulated entities must bear compliance costs, as well as the MSA’s sanctions provision, Section 1858(g)(1)(D).  See <em>id.</em>, at 629–631.  And it rejected petitioners’ argument that the express statutory authorization of three industry funding programs demonstrated that NMFS lacked the broad implicit authority it asserted to impose such a program for the Atlantic herring fishery.  See <em>id.</em>, at 631–633.  The court ultimately concluded that the “[a]gency’s interpretation of its authority to require at-sea monitors who are paid for by owners of regulated vessels does not ‘exceed[&nbsp;] the bounds of the permissible.’&nbsp;”  <em>Id.</em>, at 633–634 (quoting <em>Barnhart</em> v. <em>Walton</em>, <a aria-label=\"535 U. S. 212\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/535/212\">535 U.&nbsp;S. 212</a>, 218 (2002); alteration in original).  In reaching that conclusion, the First Circuit stated that it was applying <em>Chevron</em>’s two-step framework.  62 F.&nbsp;4th, at 628.  But it did not explain which aspects of its analysis were relevant to which of <em>Chevron</em>’s two steps.<em> </em>Similarly, it declined to decide whether the result was “a product of <em>Chevron</em> step one or step two.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 634.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> We granted certiorari in both cases, limited to the question whether <em>Chevron</em> should be overruled or clarified.

The Framers appreciated that the laws judges would necessarily apply in resolving those disputes would not always be clear.  Cognizant of the limits of human language and foresight, they anticipated that “[a]ll new laws, though penned with the greatest technical skill, and passed on the fullest and most mature deliberation,” would be “more or less obscure and equivocal, until their meaning” was settled “by a series of particular discussions and adjudications.”  The Federalist No.&nbsp;37, p.&nbsp;236 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (J. Madison).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Framers also envisioned that the final “interpretation of the laws” would be “the proper and peculiar province of the courts.”  <em>Id.</em>, No.&nbsp;78, at 525 (A. Hamilton).  Unlike the political branches, the courts would by design exercise “neither Force nor Will, but merely judgment.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 523.  To ensure the “steady, upright and impartial administration of the laws,” the Framers structured the Constitution to allow judges to exercise that judgment independent of influence from the political branches.  <em>Id.</em>, at 522; see <em>id.</em>, at 522–524; <em>Stern</em> v. <em>Marshall</em>, <a aria-label=\"564 U. S. 462\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/564/462\">564 U.&nbsp;S. 462</a>, 484 (2011).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This Court embraced the Framers’ understanding of the judicial function early on.  In the foundational decision of <em>Marbury </em>v. <em>Madison</em>, Chief Justice Marshall famously declared that “[i]t is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.”  1 Cranch 137, &nbsp;177 (1803).  And in the following decades, the Court understood “interpret[ing] the laws, in the last resort,” to be a “solemn duty” of the Judiciary.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Dickson</em>, 15 Pet. 141, 162 (1841) (Story, J., for the Court).  When the meaning of a statute was at issue, the judicial role was to “interpret the act of Congress, in order to ascertain the rights of the parties.”  <em>Decatur</em> v. <em>Paulding</em>, 14 Pet. 497, 515 (1840).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Court also recognized from the outset, though, that exercising independent judgment often included according due respect to Executive Branch interpretations of federal statutes.  For example, in <em>Edwards’ Lessee</em> v. <em>Darby</em>, 12 Wheat. 206 (1827), the Court explained that “[i]n the construction of a doubtful and ambiguous law, the contemporaneous construction of those who were called upon to act under the law, and were appointed to carry its provisions into effect, is entitled to very great respect.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 210; see also <em>United States</em> v. <em>Vowell</em>, 5 Cranch 368, 372 (1809) (Marshall, C.&nbsp;J., for the Court).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Such respect was thought especially warranted when an Executive Branch interpretation was issued roughly contemporaneously with enactment of the statute and remained consistent over time.  See <em>Dickson</em>, 15 Pet., at 161; <em>United States</em> v. <em>Alabama Great Southern R. Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"142 U. S. 615\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/142/615\">142 U.&nbsp;S. 615</a>, 621 (1892); <em>National Lead Co.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"252 U. S. 140\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/252/140\">252 U.&nbsp;S. 140</a>, 145–146 (1920).  That is because “the longstanding ‘practice of the government’&nbsp;”—like any other interpretive aid—“can inform [a court’s] determination of ‘what the law is.’&nbsp;”  <em>NLRB</em> v. <em>Noel Canning</em>, <a aria-label=\"573 U. S. 513\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/573/513\">573 U.&nbsp;S. 513</a>, 525 (2014)<em> </em>(first quoting <em>McCulloch</em> v. <em>Maryland</em>, 4 Wheat. 316, 401 (1819); then quoting <em>Marbury</em>, 1 Cranch, at 177).  The Court also gave “the most respectful consideration” to Executive Branch interpretations simply because “[t]he officers concerned [were] usually able men, and masters of the subject,” who were “[n]ot unfrequently .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the draftsmen of the laws they [were] afterwards called upon to interpret.”  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Moore</em>, <a aria-label=\"95 U. S. 760\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/95/760\">95 U.&nbsp;S. 760</a>, 763 (1878); see also <em>Jacobs</em> v. <em>Prichard</em>, <a aria-label=\"223 U. S. 200\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/223/200\">223 U.&nbsp;S. 200</a>, 214 (1912).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> “Respect,” though, was just that.  The views of the Executive Branch could inform the judgment of the Judiciary, but did not supersede it.  Whatever respect an Executive Branch interpretation was due, a judge “certainly would not be bound to adopt the construction given by the head of a department.”  <em>Decatur</em>, 14 Pet., at 515; see also <em>Burnet</em> v. <em>Chicago Portrait Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"285 U. S. 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/285/1\">285 U.&nbsp;S. 1</a>, 16 (1932).  Otherwise, judicial judgment would not be independent at all.  As Justice Story put it, “in cases where [a court’s] own judgment .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. differ[ed] from that of other high functionaries,” the court was “not at liberty to surrender, or to waive it.”  <em>Dickson</em>, 15 Pet., at 162.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The New Deal ushered in a “rapid expansion of the administrative process.”  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Morton Salt Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"338 U. S. 632\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/338/632\">338 U.&nbsp;S. 632</a>, 644 (1950).  But as new agencies with new powers proliferated, the Court continued to adhere to the traditional understanding that questions of law were for courts to decide, exercising independent judgment.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> During this period, the Court often treated agency determinations of <em>fact</em> as binding on the courts, provided that there was “evidence to support the findings.”  <em>St. Joseph Stock Yards Co.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"298 U. S. 38\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/298/38\">298 U.&nbsp;S. 38</a>, 51 (1936).  “When the legislature itself acts within the broad field of legislative discretion,” the Court reasoned, “its determinations are conclusive.”  <em>Ibid.</em>  Congress could therefore “appoint[&nbsp;] an agent to act within that sphere of legislative authority” and “endow the agent with power to make <em>findings of fact</em> which are conclusive, provided the requirements of due process which are specially applicable to such an agency are met, as in according a fair hearing and acting upon evidence and not arbitrarily.”  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> But the Court did not extend similar deference to agency &nbsp;resolutions of questions of <em>law</em>.  It instead made clear, repeatedly, that “[t]he interpretation of the meaning of statutes, as applied to justiciable controversies,” was “exclusively a judicial function.”  <em>United States</em> v. <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"310 U. S. 534\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/310/534\">310 U.&nbsp;S. 534</a>, 544 (1940); see also <em>Social Security Bd.</em> v. <em>Nierotko</em>, <a aria-label=\"327 U. S. 358\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/327/358\">327 U.&nbsp;S. 358</a>, 369 (1946); <em>Medo Photo Supply Corp.</em> v. <em>NLRB</em>, <a aria-label=\"321 U. S. 678\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/321/678\">321 U.&nbsp;S. 678</a>, 681–682, n.&nbsp;1 (1944).  The Court understood, in the words of Justice Brandeis, that “[t]he supremacy of law demands that there shall be opportunity to have some court decide whether an erroneous rule of law was applied.”<em>  St. Joseph Stock Yards</em>, 298 U.&nbsp;S., at 84 (concurring opinion).  It also continued to note, as it long had, that the informed judgment of the Executive Branch—especially in the form of an interpretation issued contemporaneously with the enactment of the statute—could be entitled to “great weight.”  <em>American Trucking Assns.</em>, 310 U.&nbsp;S., at 549.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Perhaps most notably along those lines, in <em>Skidmore</em> v. <em>Swift &amp; Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"323 U.S. 134\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/323/134\">323 U.&nbsp;S. 134 (1944)</a>, the Court explained that the “interpretations and opinions” of the relevant agency, “made in pursuance of official duty” and “based upon .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. specialized experience,” “constitute[d] a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants [could] properly resort for guidance,” even on legal questions.  <em>Id.</em>, at 139–140.  “The weight of such a judgment in a particular case,” the Court observed, would “depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 140.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> On occasion, to be sure, the Court applied deferential review upon concluding that a particular statute empowered an agency to decide how a broad statutory term applied to specific facts found by the agency.  For example, in <em>Gray</em> v. <em>Powell</em>, <a aria-label=\"314 U.S. 402\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/314/402\">314 U.&nbsp;S. 402 (1941)</a>, the Court deferred to an administrative conclusion that a coal-burning railroad that &nbsp;had arrangements with several coal mines was not a coal “producer” under the Bituminous Coal Act of 1937.  Congress had “specifically” granted the agency the authority to make that determination.  <em>Id.</em>, at 411.  The Court thus reasoned that “[w]here, as here, a determination has been left to an administrative body, this delegation will be respected and the administrative conclusion left untouched” so long as the agency’s decision constituted “a sensible exercise of judgment.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 412–413.  Similarly, in <em>NLRB</em> v. <em>Hearst Publications, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"322 U.S. 111\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/322/111\">322 U.&nbsp;S. 111 (1944)</a>, the Court deferred to the determination of the National Labor Relations Board that newsboys were “employee[s]” within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act.  The Act had, in the Court’s judgment, “assigned primarily” to the Board the task of marking a “definitive limitation around the term ‘employee.’&nbsp;”  <em>Id.</em>, at 130.  The Court accordingly viewed its own role as “limited” to assessing whether the Board’s determination had a “&nbsp;‘warrant in the record’ and a reasonable basis in law.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 131.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Such deferential review, though, was cabined to factbound determinations like those at issue in <em>Gray </em>and <em>Hearst</em>.  Neither <em>Gray </em>nor <em>Hearst</em> purported to refashion the longstanding judicial approach to questions of law.  In <em>Gray</em>, after deferring to the agency’s determination that a particular entity was not a “producer” of coal, the Court went on to discern, based on its own reading of the text, whether another statutory term—“other disposal” of coal—encompassed a transaction lacking a transfer of title.  See 314 U.&nbsp;S., at 416–417.  The Court evidently perceived no basis for deference to the agency with respect to that pure legal question.  And in <em>Hearst</em>, the Court proclaimed that “[u]ndoubtedly questions of statutory interpretation .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. are for the courts to resolve, giving appropriate weight to the judgment of those whose special duty is to administer the questioned statute.”  322 U.&nbsp;S., at 130–131.  At least with &nbsp;respect to questions it regarded as involving “statutory interpretation,” the Court thus did not disturb the traditional rule.  It merely thought that a different approach should apply where application of a statutory term was sufficiently intertwined with the agency’s factfinding.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In any event, the Court was far from consistent in reviewing deferentially even such factbound statutory determinations.  Often the Court simply interpreted and applied the statute before it.  See K. Davis, Administrative Law §248, p.&nbsp;893 (1951) (“The one statement that can be made with confidence about applicability of the doctrine of Gray v. Powell is that sometimes the Supreme Court applies it and sometimes it does not.”); B. Schwartz, Gray vs. Powell and the Scope of Review, 54 Mich. L.&nbsp;Rev. 1, 68 (1955) (noting an “embarrassingly large number of Supreme Court decisions that do not adhere to the doctrine of <em>Gray v. Powell</em>”).  In one illustrative example, the Court rejected the U.&nbsp;S. Price Administrator’s determination that a particular warehouse was a “public utility” entitled to an exemption from the Administrator’s General Maximum Price Regulation.  Despite the striking resemblance of that administrative determination to those that triggered deference in <em>Gray</em> and <em>Hearst</em>, the Court declined to “accept the Administrator’s view in deference to administrative construction.”  <em>Davies Warehouse Co.</em> v. <em>Bowles</em>, <a aria-label=\"321 U. S. 144\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/321/144\">321 U.&nbsp;S. 144</a>, 156 (1944).  The Administrator’s view, the Court explained, had “hardly seasoned or broadened into a settled administrative practice,” and thus did not “overweigh the considerations” the Court had “set forth as to the proper construction of the statute.”  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Nothing in the New Deal era or before it thus resembled the deference rule the Court would begin applying decades later to all varieties of agency interpretations of statutes.  Instead, just five years after <em>Gray</em> and two after <em>Hearst</em>, Congress codified the opposite rule: the traditional understanding that <em>courts</em> must “decide all relevant questions of &nbsp;law.”  <a aria-label=\"5 USC 706\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/706\">5 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §706</a>.<a aria-label=\"reference 3 of Roberts Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-3\" id=\"OPINION_4-3ref\"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">C</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Congress in 1946 enacted the APA “as a check upon administrators whose zeal might otherwise have carried them to excesses not contemplated in legislation creating their offices.”  <em>Morton Salt</em>, 338 U.&nbsp;S., at 644.  It was the culmination of a “comprehensive rethinking of the place of administrative agencies in a regime of separate and divided powers.”  <em>Bowen</em> v. <em>Michigan Academy of Family Physicians</em>, <a aria-label=\"476 U. S. 667\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/476/667\">476 U.&nbsp;S. 667</a>, 670–671 (1986).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In addition to prescribing procedures for agency action, the APA delineates the basic contours of judicial review of such action.  As relevant here, Section 706 directs that “[t]o &nbsp;the extent necessary to decision and when presented, the reviewing court shall decide all relevant questions of law, interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, and determine the meaning or applicability of the terms of an agency action.”  <a aria-label=\"5 USC 706\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/706\">5 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §706</a>.  It further requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not in accordance with law.”  §706(2)(A).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The APA thus codifies for agency cases the unremarkable, yet elemental proposition reflected by judicial practice dating back to <em>Marbury</em>: that courts decide legal questions by applying their own judgment.  It specifies that courts, not agencies, will decide “<em>all</em> relevant questions of law” arising on review of agency action, §706 (emphasis added)—even those involving ambiguous laws—and set aside any such action inconsistent with the law as they interpret it.  And it prescribes no deferential standard for courts to employ in answering those legal questions.  That omission is telling, because Section 706 <em>does</em> mandate that judicial review of agency policymaking and factfinding be deferential.  See §706(2)(A) (agency action to be set aside if “arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion”); §706(2)(E) (agency factfinding in formal proceedings to be set aside if “unsupported by substantial evidence”).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In a statute designed to “serve as the fundamental charter of the administrative state,” <em>Kisor</em> v. <em>Wilkie</em>, <a aria-label=\"588 U. S. 558\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/588/558\">588 U.&nbsp;S. 558</a>, 580 (2019) (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted), Congress surely would have articulated a similarly deferential standard applicable to questions of law had it intended to depart from the settled pre-APA understanding that deciding such questions was “exclusively a judicial function,” <em>American Trucking Assns.</em>, 310 U.&nbsp;S., at 544.  But nothing in the APA hints at such a dramatic departure.  On the contrary, by directing courts to “interpret constitutional and statutory provisions” without differentiating between the two, Section 706 makes clear that &nbsp;agency interpretations of statutes—like agency interpretations of the Constitution—are <em>not</em> entitled to deference.  Under the APA, it thus “remains the responsibility of the court to decide whether the law means what the agency says.”  <em>Perez</em> v. <em>Mortgage Bankers Assn.</em>, <a aria-label=\"575 U. S. 92\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/575/92\">575 U.&nbsp;S. 92</a>, 109 (2015) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).<a aria-label=\"reference 4 of Roberts Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-4\" id=\"OPINION_4-4ref\"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The text of the APA means what it says.  And a look at its history if anything only underscores that plain meaning.  According to both the House and Senate Reports on the legislation, Section 706 “provide[d] that questions of law are for courts <em>rather than agencies</em> to decide in the last analysis.”  H.&nbsp;R. Rep. No. 1980, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 44 (1946) (emphasis added); accord, S.&nbsp;Rep. No. 752, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 28 (1945).  Some of the legislation’s most prominent supporters articulated the same view.  See 92 Cong. Rec. 5654 (1946) (statement of Rep. Walter); P. McCarran, Improving “Administrative Justice”: Hearings and Evidence; Scope of Judicial Review, 32 A.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;J. 827, 831 (1946).  Even the Department of Justice—an agency with every incentive to endorse a view of the APA favorable to the Executive Branch—opined after its enactment that Section 706 merely “restate[d] the present law as to the scope of judicial review.”  Dept. of Justice, Attorney General’s Manual on the &nbsp;Administrative Procedure Act 108 (1947); see also <em>Kisor</em>, 588 U.&nbsp;S., at 582 (plurality opinion) (same).  That “present law,” as we have described, adhered to the traditional conception of the judicial function.  See <em>supra</em>, at 9–13.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Various respected commentators contemporaneously maintained that the APA required reviewing courts to exercise independent judgment on questions of law.  Professor John Dickinson, for example, read the APA to “impose a clear mandate that all [questions of law] shall be decided by the reviewing Court itself, and in the exercise of its own independent judgment.”  Administrative Procedure Act: Scope and Grounds of Broadened Judicial Review, 33 A.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;J. 434, 516 (1947).  Professor Bernard Schwartz noted that §706 “would seem .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to be merely a legislative restatement of the familiar review principle that questions of law are for the reviewing court, at the same time leaving to the courts the task of determining in each case what are questions of law.”  Mixed Questions of Law and Fact and the Administrative Procedure Act, 19 Ford. L.&nbsp;Rev. 73, 84–85 (1950).  And Professor Louis Jaffe, who had served in several agencies at the advent of the New Deal, thought that §706 leaves it up to the reviewing “court” to “decide as a ‘question of law’ whether there is ‘discretion’ in the premises”—that is, whether the statute at issue delegates particular discretionary authority to an agency.  Judicial Control of Administrative Action 570 (1965).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The APA, in short, incorporates the traditional understanding of the judicial function, under which courts must exercise independent judgment in determining the meaning of statutory provisions.  In exercising such judgment, though, courts may—as they have from the start—seek aid from the interpretations of those responsible for implementing particular statutes.  Such interpretations “constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance” consistent with the APA.  <em>Skidmore</em>, 323 U.&nbsp;S., at 140.  And &nbsp;interpretations issued contemporaneously with the statute at issue, and which have remained consistent over time, may be especially useful in determining the statute’s meaning.  See <em>ibid.</em>; <em>American Trucking</em> <em>Assns.</em>, 310 U.&nbsp;S., at 549.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In a case involving an agency, of course, the statute’s meaning may well be that the agency is authorized to exercise a degree of discretion.  Congress has often enacted such statutes.  For example, some statutes “expressly delegate[&nbsp;]” to an agency the authority to give meaning to a particular statutory term.  <em>Batterton</em> v. <em>Francis</em>, <a aria-label=\"432 U. S. 416\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/432/416\">432 U.&nbsp;S. 416</a>, 425 (1977) (emphasis deleted).<a aria-label=\"reference 5 of Roberts Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-5\" id=\"OPINION_4-5ref\"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup></a>  Others empower an agency to prescribe rules to “fill up the details” of a statutory scheme, <em>Wayman</em> v. <em>Southard</em>, 10 Wheat. 1, 43 (1825), or to regulate subject to the limits imposed by a term or phrase that “leaves agencies with flexibility,” <em>Michigan</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, <a aria-label=\"576 U. S. 743\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/576/743\">576 U.&nbsp;S. 743</a>, 752 (2015), such as “appropriate” or “reasonable.”<a aria-label=\"reference 6 of Roberts Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-6\" id=\"OPINION_4-6ref\"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> When the best reading of a statute is that it delegates &nbsp;discretionary authority to an agency, the role of the reviewing court under the APA is, as always, to independently interpret the statute and effectuate the will of Congress subject to constitutional limits.  The court fulfills that role by recognizing constitutional delegations, “fix[ing] the boundaries of [the] delegated authority,” H. Monaghan, <em>Marbury</em> and the Administrative State, 83 Colum. L.&nbsp;Rev. 1, 27 (1983), and ensuring the agency has engaged in “&nbsp;‘reasoned decisionmaking’&nbsp;” within those boundaries, <em>Michigan</em>, 576 U.&nbsp;S., at 750 (quoting <em>Allentown Mack Sales &amp; Service, Inc.</em> v. <em>NLRB</em>, <a aria-label=\"522 U. S. 359\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/522/359\">522 U.&nbsp;S. 359</a>, 374 (1998)); see also <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc.</em> v. <em>State Farm Mut.

By doing so, a court upholds the traditional conception of the judicial function that the APA adopts.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">III</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The deference that <em>Chevron </em>requires of courts reviewing agency action cannot be squared with the APA.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">A</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> In the decades between the enactment of the APA and this Court’s decision in <em>Chevron</em>, courts generally continued to review agency interpretations of the statutes they administer by independently examining each statute to determine its meaning.  Cf. T. Merrill, Judicial Deference to Executive Precedent, 101 Yale L.&nbsp;J. 969, 972–975 (1992).  As an early proponent (and later critic) of <em>Chevron </em>recounted, courts during this period thus identified delegations of discretionary authority to agencies on a “statute-by-statute basis.”  A. Scalia, Judicial Deference to Administrative Interpretations of Law, 1989 Duke L.&nbsp;J. 511, 516.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Chevron</em>, decided in 1984 by a bare quorum of six Justices, triggered a marked departure from the traditional approach.  The question in the case was whether an EPA regulation “allow[ing] States to treat all of the pollution-&nbsp;emitting devices within the same industrial grouping as though they were encased within a single ‘bubble’&nbsp;” was consistent with the term “stationary source” as used in the Clean Air Act.  467 U.&nbsp;S., at 840.  To answer that question of statutory interpretation, the Court articulated and employed a now familiar two-step approach broadly applicable to review of agency action.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The first step was to discern “whether Congress ha[d] directly spoken to the precise question at issue.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 842.  The Court explained that “[i]f the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter,” <em>ibid.</em>, and courts were therefore to “reject administrative constructions which are contrary to clear congressional intent,” <em>id.</em>, at 843, n.&nbsp;9.  To discern such intent, the Court noted, a reviewing court was to “employ[&nbsp;] traditional tools of statutory construction.”  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Without mentioning the APA, or acknowledging any doctrinal shift, the Court articulated a second step applicable when “Congress ha[d] not directly addressed the precise question at issue.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 843.  In such a case—that is, a case in which “the statute [was] silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue” at hand<em>—</em>a reviewing court could not “simply impose its own construction on the statute, as would be necessary in the absence of an administrative interpretation.”  <em>Ibid.</em> (footnote omitted).  A court instead had to set aside the traditional interpretive tools and defer to the agency if it had offered “a permissible construction of the statute,” <em>ibid.</em>, even if not “the reading the court would have reached if the question initially had arisen in a judicial proceeding,” <em>ibid.</em>, n.&nbsp;11.  That directive was justified, according to the Court, by the understanding that administering statutes “requires the formulation of policy” to fill statutory “gap[s]”; by the long judicial tradition of according “considerable weight” to Executive Branch interpretations; and by a host of other considerations, including the complexity of the regulatory scheme, EPA’s “detailed &nbsp;and reasoned” consideration, the policy-laden nature of the judgment supposedly required, and the agency’s indirect accountability to the people through the President.  <em>Id.</em>, at 843, 844, and n.&nbsp;14, 865.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Employing this new test, the Court concluded that Congress had not addressed the question at issue with the necessary “level of specificity” and that EPA’s interpretation was “entitled to deference.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 865.  It did not matter <em>why </em>Congress, as the Court saw it, had not squarely addressed the question, see <em>ibid.</em>, or that “the agency ha[d] from time to time changed its interpretation,” <em>id.</em>, at 863.  The latest EPA interpretation was a permissible reading of the Clean Air Act, so under the Court’s new rule, that reading controlled.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Initially, <em>Chevron</em> “seemed destined to obscurity.”  T. Merrill, The Story of <em>Chevron</em>: The Making of an Accidental Landmark, 66 Admin. L.&nbsp;Rev. 253, 276 (2014).  The Court did not at first treat it as the watershed decision it was fated to become; it was hardly cited in cases involving statutory questions of agency authority.  See <em>ibid.</em>  But within a few years, both this Court and the courts of appeals were routinely invoking its two-step framework as the governing standard in such cases.  See <em>id.</em>, at 276–277.  As the Court did so, it revisited the doctrine’s justifications.  Eventually, the Court decided that <em>Chevron</em> rested on “a presumption that Congress, when it left ambiguity in a statute meant for implementation by an agency, understood that the ambiguity would be resolved, first and foremost, by the agency, and desired the agency (rather than the courts) to possess whatever degree of discretion the ambiguity allows.”  <em>Smiley</em> v. <em>Citibank (South Dakota), N.&nbsp;A.</em>, <a aria-label=\"517 U. S. 735\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/517/735\">517 U.&nbsp;S. 735</a>, 740–741 (1996); see also, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Cuozzo Speed Technologies, LLC</em> v. <em>Lee</em>, <a aria-label=\"579 U.

The “law of deference” that this Court has built on the foundation laid in <em>Chevron </em>has instead been “[h]eedless of the original design” of the APA.  <em>Perez</em>, 575 U.&nbsp;S., at 109 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">1</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"><em> Chevron</em> defies the command of the APA that “the reviewing court”—not the agency whose action it reviews—is to “decide <em>all</em> relevant questions of law” and “interpret .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. statutory provisions.”  §706 (emphasis added).  It requires a court to <em>ignore</em>, not follow, “the reading the court would have reached” had it exercised its independent judgment as required by the APA.  <em>Chevron</em>, 467 U.&nbsp;S., at 843, n.&nbsp;11.  And although exercising independent judgment is consistent with the “respect” historically given to Executive Branch interpretations, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Edwards’ Lessee</em>, 12 Wheat., at 210; <em>Skidmore</em>, 323 U.&nbsp;S., at 140, <em>Chevron</em> insists on much more.  It demands that courts mechanically afford <em>binding </em>deference to agency interpretations, including those that have been inconsistent over time.  See 467 U.&nbsp;S., at 863.  Still worse, it forces courts to do so even when a pre-existing judicial precedent holds that the statute means something else—unless the prior court happened to also say that the statute is “unambiguous.”  <em>Brand X</em>, 545 U.&nbsp;S., at 982.  That regime is the antithesis of the time honored approach the APA prescribes.  In fretting over the prospect of “allow[ing]” a judicial interpretation of a statute “to override an agency’s” in a dispute before a court, <em>ibid.</em>, <em>Chevron</em> turns the statutory scheme for judicial review of agency action upside down.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Chevron </em>cannot be reconciled with the APA, as the Government and the dissent contend, by presuming that statutory ambiguities are implicit delegations to agencies.  See &nbsp;Brief for Respondents in No. 22–1219, pp.&nbsp;13, 37–38; <em>post</em>, at 4–15 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Kagan</span>, J.).  Presumptions have their place in statutory interpretation, but only to the extent that they approximate reality.  <em>Chevron</em>’s presumption does not, because “[a]n ambiguity is simply not a delegation of law-interpreting power.  <em>Chevron </em>confuses the two.”  C. Sunstein, Interpreting Statutes in the Regulatory State, 103 Harv. L.&nbsp;Rev. 405, 445 (1989).  As <em>Chevron </em>itself noted, ambiguities may result from an inability on the part of Congress to squarely answer the question at hand, or from a failure to even “consider the question” with the requisite precision.  467 U.&nbsp;S., at 865.  In neither case does an ambiguity necessarily reflect a congressional intent that an agency, as opposed to a court, resolve the resulting interpretive question.  And many or perhaps most statutory ambiguities may be unintentional.  As the Framers recognized, ambiguities will inevitably follow from “the complexity of objects, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the imperfection of the human faculties,” and the simple fact that “no language is so copious as to supply words and phrases for every complex idea.”  The Federalist No. 37, at 236.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Courts, after all, routinely confront statutory ambiguities in cases having nothing to do with <em>Chevron</em>—cases that do not involve agency interpretations or delegations of authority.  Of course, when faced with a statutory ambiguity in such a case, the ambiguity is not a delegation to anybody, and a court is not somehow relieved of its obligation to independently interpret the statute.  Courts in that situation do not throw up their hands because “Congress’s instructions have” supposedly “run out,” leaving a statutory “gap.”  <em>Post</em>, at 2 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Kagan</span>, J.).  Courts instead understand that such statutes, no matter how impenetrable, do—in fact, must—have a single, best meaning.  That is the whole point of having written statutes; “every statute’s meaning is fixed at the time of enactment.”  <em>Wisconsin Central Ltd.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"585 U. S. 274\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/585/274\">585 U.&nbsp;S. 274</a>, 284 (2018) (emphasis deleted).  So instead of declaring a particular party’s reading “permissible” in such a case, courts use every tool at their disposal to determine the best reading of the statute and resolve the ambiguity.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In an agency case as in any other, though, even if some judges might (or might not) consider the statute ambiguous, there is a best reading all the same—“the reading the court would have reached” if no agency were involved.  <em>Chevron</em>, 467 U.&nbsp;S., at 843, n.&nbsp;11.  It therefore makes no sense to speak of a “permissible” interpretation that is not the one the court, after applying all relevant interpretive tools, concludes is best.  In the business of statutory interpretation, if it is not the best, it is not permissible.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"><em> </em>Perhaps most fundamentally, <em>Chevron</em>’s presumption is misguided because<em> </em>agencies have no special competence in resolving statutory ambiguities.  Courts do.  The Framers, as noted, anticipated that courts would often confront statutory ambiguities and expected that courts would resolve them by exercising independent legal judgment.  And even <em>Chevron </em>itself reaffirmed that “[t]he judiciary is the final authority on issues of statutory construction” and recognized that “in the absence of an administrative interpretation,” it is “necessary” for a court to “impose its own construction on the statute.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 843, and n.&nbsp;9.  <em>Chevron</em> gravely erred, though, in concluding that the inquiry is fundamentally different just because an administrative interpretation is in play.  The very point of the traditional tools of statutory construction—the tools courts use every day—is to resolve statutory ambiguities.  That is no less true when the ambiguity is about the scope of an agency’s own power—perhaps the occasion on which abdication in favor of the agency is <em>least</em> appropriate.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">2</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The Government responds that Congress must generally &nbsp;intend for agencies to resolve statutory ambiguities because agencies have subject matter expertise regarding the statutes they administer; because deferring to agencies purportedly promotes the uniform construction of federal law; and because resolving statutory ambiguities can involve policymaking best left to political actors, rather than courts.  See Brief for Respondents in No. 22–1219, pp.&nbsp;16–19.  The dissent offers more of the same.  See <em>post</em>, at 9–14.  But none of these considerations justifies <em>Chevron</em>’s sweeping presumption of congressional intent.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Beginning with expertise, we recently noted that interpretive issues arising in connection with a regulatory scheme often “may fall more naturally into a judge’s bailiwick” than an agency’s.  <em>Kisor</em>, 588 U.&nbsp;S., at 578 (opinion of the Court).  We thus observed that “[w]hen the agency has no comparative expertise in resolving a regulatory ambiguity, Congress presumably would not grant it that authority.”  <em>Ibid.</em> <em>Chevron</em>’s broad rule of deference, though, demands that courts presume just the opposite.  Under that rule, ambiguities of all stripes trigger deference.  Indeed, the Government and, seemingly, the dissent continue to defend the proposition that <em>Chevron</em> applies even in cases having little to do with an agency’s technical subject matter expertise.  See Brief for Respondents in No. 22–1219, p.&nbsp;17; <em>post</em>, at 10.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> But even when an ambiguity happens to implicate a technical matter, it does not follow that Congress has taken the power to authoritatively interpret the statute from the courts and given it to the agency.  Congress expects courts to handle technical statutory questions.  “[M]any statutory cases” call upon “courts [to] interpret the mass of technical detail that is the ordinary diet of the law,” <em>Egelhoff</em> v. <em>Egelhoff</em>, <a aria-label=\"532 U. S. 141\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/532/141\">532 U.&nbsp;S. 141</a>, 161 (2001) (Breyer, J., dissenting), and courts did so without issue in agency cases before <em>Chevron</em>, see <em>post</em>, at 30 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Gorsuch, J.,</span> concurring).  Courts, after all, do not decide such questions blindly.  The parties and <em>amici</em> in such cases are steeped in the subject matter, and reviewing courts have the benefit of their perspectives.  In an agency case in particular, the court will go about its task with the agency’s “body of experience and informed judgment,” among other information, at its disposal.  <em>Skidmore</em>, 323 U.&nbsp;S., at 140.  And although an agency’s interpretation of a statute “cannot bind a court,” it may be especially informative “to the extent it rests on factual premises within [the agency’s] expertise.”  <em>Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms</em> v. <em>FLRA</em>, <a aria-label=\"464 U. S. 89\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/464/89\">464 U.&nbsp;S. 89</a>, 98, n.&nbsp;8 (1983).  Such expertise has always been one of the factors which may give an Executive Branch interpretation particular “power to persuade, if lacking power to control.”  <em>Skidmore</em>,<em> </em>323 U.&nbsp;S., at 140; see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>County of Maui</em> v. <em>Hawaii Wildlife Fund</em>, <a aria-label=\"590 U. S. 165\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/590/165\">590 U.&nbsp;S. 165</a>, 180 (2020); <em>Moore</em>, 95 U.&nbsp;S., at 763.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> For those reasons, delegating ultimate interpretive authority to agencies is simply not necessary to ensure that the resolution of statutory ambiguities is well informed by subject matter expertise.  The better presumption is therefore that Congress expects courts to do their ordinary job of interpreting statutes, with due respect for the views of the Executive Branch.  And to the extent that Congress and the Executive Branch may disagree with how the courts have performed that job in a particular case, they are of course always free to act by revising the statute.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Nor does a desire for the uniform construction of federal law justify <em>Chevron</em>.  Given inconsistencies in how judges apply <em>Chevron</em>, see <em>infra</em>, at 30–33, it is unclear how much the doctrine as a whole (as opposed to its highly deferential second step) actually promotes such uniformity.  In any event, there is little value in imposing a uniform interpretation of a statute if that interpretation is wrong.  We see no reason to presume that Congress prefers uniformity for uniformity’s sake over the correct interpretation of the laws it enacts.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; The view that interpretation of ambiguous statutory provisions amounts to policymaking suited for political actors rather than courts is especially mistaken, for it rests on a profound misconception of the judicial role.  It is reasonable to assume that Congress intends to leave policymaking to political actors.  But resolution of statutory ambiguities involves legal interpretation.  That task does not suddenly become policymaking just because a court has an “agency to fall back on.”  <em>Kisor</em>, 588 U.&nbsp;S., at 575 (opinion of the Court).  Courts interpret statutes, no matter the context, based on the traditional tools of statutory construction, not individual policy preferences.  Indeed, the Framers crafted the Constitution to ensure that federal judges could exercise judgment free from the influence of the political branches.  See The Federalist, No. 78, at 522–525.  They were to construe the law with “[c]lear heads .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and honest hearts,” not with an eye to policy preferences that had not made it into the statute.  1 Works of James Wilson 363 (J. Andrews ed. 1896).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> That is not to say that Congress cannot or does not confer discretionary authority on agencies.  Congress may do so, subject to constitutional limits, and it often has.  But to stay out of discretionary policymaking left to the political branches, judges need only fulfill their obligations under the APA to independently identify and respect such delegations of authority, police the outer statutory boundaries of those delegations, and ensure that agencies exercise their discretion consistent with the APA.  By forcing courts to instead pretend that ambiguities are necessarily delegations, <em>Chevron</em> does not prevent judges from making policy.  It prevents them from judging.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">3</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> In truth, <em>Chevron</em>’s justifying presumption is, as Members of this Court have often recognized, a fiction.  See <em>Buffington</em> v. <em>McDonough</em>, 598 U.&nbsp;S. ___, ___ (2022) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Gorsuch</span>, &nbsp;J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (slip op., at 11); <em>Cuozzo</em>, 579 U.&nbsp;S., at 286 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas</span>, J., concurring); Scalia, 1989 Duke L.&nbsp;J., at 517; see also <em>post</em>, at 15 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Kagan</span>, J.).  So we have spent the better part of four decades imposing one limitation on <em>Chevron </em>after another, pruning its presumption on the understanding that “where it is in doubt that Congress actually intended to delegate particular interpretive authority to an agency, <em>Chevron</em> is ‘inapplicable.’&nbsp;”  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Mead Corp.</em>, <a aria-label=\"533 U. S. 218\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/533/218\">533 U.&nbsp;S. 218</a>, 230 (2001) (quoting <em>Christensen</em> v. <em>Harris County</em>, <a aria-label=\"529 U. S. 576\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/529/576\">529 U.&nbsp;S. 576</a>, 597 (2000) (Breyer, J., dissenting)); see also <em>Adams Fruit Co.</em> v. <em>Barrett</em>, <a aria-label=\"494 U. S. 638\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/494/638\">494 U.&nbsp;S. 638</a>, 649 (1990).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Consider the many refinements we have made in an effort to match <em>Chevron</em>’s presumption to reality.  We have said that <em>Chevron</em> applies only “when it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.”  <em>Mead</em>, 533 U.&nbsp;S., at 226–227.  In practice, that threshold requirement—sometimes called <em>Chevron </em>“step zero”—largely limits <em>Chevron</em> to “the fruits of notice-and-comment rulemaking or formal adjudication.”  533 U.&nbsp;S., at 230.  But even when those processes are used, deference is still not warranted “where the regulation is ‘procedurally defective’—that is, where the agency errs by failing to follow the correct procedures in issuing the regulation.”  <em>Encino Motorcars, LLC</em> v. <em>Navarro</em>, <a aria-label=\"579 U. S. 211\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/579/211\">579 U.&nbsp;S. 211</a>, 220 (2016) (quoting <em>Mead</em>, 533 U.&nbsp;S., at 227).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Even where those procedural hurdles are cleared, substantive ones remain.  Most notably, <em>Chevron</em> does not apply if the question at issue is one of “deep ‘economic and political significance.’&nbsp;”  <em>King</em> v. <em>Burwell</em>, <a aria-label=\"576 U. S. 473\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/576/473\">576 U.&nbsp;S. 473</a>, 486 (2015).  We have instead expected Congress to delegate such authority “expressly” if at all, <em>ibid.</em>, for “[e]xtraordinary grants of regulatory authority are rarely accomplished through ‘modest words,’ ‘vague terms,’ or ‘subtle device[s],’&nbsp;” <em>West Virginia</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, <a aria-label=\"597 U. S. 697\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/597/697\">597 U.&nbsp;S. 697</a>, 723 (2022) (quoting <em>Whitman</em> v. <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"531 U. S. 457\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/531/457\">531 U.&nbsp;S. 457</a>, 468 (2001); alteration in original).  Nor have we applied <em>Chevron</em> to agency interpretations of judicial review provisions, see <em>Adams Fruit Co.</em>, 494 U.&nbsp;S., at 649–650, or to statutory schemes not administered by the agency seeking deference, see <em>Epic Systems Corp.</em> v. <em>Lewis</em>, <a aria-label=\"584 U. S. 497\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/584/497\">584 U.&nbsp;S. 497</a>, 519–520 (2018).  And we have sent mixed signals on whether <em>Chevron </em>applies when a statute has criminal applications.  Compare <em>Abramski</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"573 U. S. 169\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/573/169\">573 U.&nbsp;S. 169</a>, 191 (2014), with <em>Babbitt</em> v. <em>Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore.</em>, <a aria-label=\"515 U. S. 687\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/515/687\">515 U.&nbsp;S. 687</a>, 704, n.&nbsp;18 (1995).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Confronted with this byzantine set of preconditions and exceptions, some courts have simply bypassed <em>Chevron</em>, saying it makes no difference for one reason or another.<a aria-label=\"reference 7 of Roberts Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-7\" id=\"OPINION_4-7ref\"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup></a>  And even when they do invoke <em>Chevron</em>, courts do not always heed the various steps and nuances of that evolving doctrine.  In one of the cases before us today, for example, the First Circuit both skipped “step zero,” see 62 F.&nbsp;4th, at 628, and refused to “classify [its] conclusion as a product of <em>Chevron</em> step one or step two”—though it ultimately appears to have deferred under step two, <em>id.</em>, at 634.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; This Court, for its part, has not deferred to an agency interpretation under <em>Chevron</em> since 2016.  See <em>Cuozzo</em>, 579 U.&nbsp;S., at 280 (most recent occasion).  But <em>Chevron</em> remains on the books.  So litigants must continue to wrestle with it, and lower courts—bound by even our crumbling precedents, see <em>Agostini</em> v. <em>Felton</em>, <a aria-label=\"521 U. S. 203\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/521/203\">521 U.&nbsp;S. 203</a>, 238 (1997)—understandably continue to apply it.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The experience of the last 40 years has thus done little to rehabilitate <em>Chevron</em>.  It has only made clear that <em>Chevron</em>’s fictional presumption of congressional intent was always unmoored from the APA’s demand that courts exercise independent judgment in construing statutes administered by agencies.  At best, our intricate <em>Chevron</em> doctrine has been nothing more than a distraction from the question that matters: Does the statute authorize the challenged agency action?  And at worst, it has required courts to violate the APA by yielding to an agency the express responsibility, vested in “the reviewing <em>court</em>,” to “decide all relevant questions of law” and “interpret .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. statutory provisions.”  §706 (emphasis added).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">IV</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The only question left is whether <em>stare decisis</em>, the doctrine governing judicial adherence to precedent,<em> </em>requires us to persist in the <em>Chevron </em>project.  It does not.  <em>Stare decisis</em> is not an “inexorable command,” <em>Payne</em> v. <em>Tennessee</em>, <a aria-label=\"501 U. S. 808\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/501/808\">501 U.&nbsp;S. 808</a>, 828 (1991), and the <em>stare decisis</em> considerations most relevant here—“the quality of [the precedent’s] reasoning, the workability of the rule it established, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and reliance on the decision,” <em>Knick </em>v. <em>Township of Scott</em>, <a aria-label=\"588 U. S. 180\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/588/180\">588 U.&nbsp;S. 180</a>, 203 (2019) (quoting <em>Janus</em> v. <em>State, County, and Municipal Employees</em>, <a aria-label=\"585 U. S. 878\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/585/878\">585 U.&nbsp;S. 878</a>, 917 (2018))—all weigh in favor of letting <em>Chevron </em>go.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Chevron </em>has proved to be fundamentally misguided.  Despite reshaping judicial review of agency action, neither it nor any case of ours applying it grappled with the APA—&nbsp;the statute that lays out how such review works.  Its flaws were nonetheless apparent from the start, prompting this Court to revise its foundations and continually limit its application.  It has launched and sustained a cottage industry of scholars attempting to decipher its basis and meaning.  And Members of this Court have long questioned its premises.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Pereira </em>v. <em>Sessions</em>, <a aria-label=\"585 U. S. 198\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/585/198\">585 U.&nbsp;S. 198</a>, 219–221 (2018) (Kennedy,&nbsp;J., concurring); <em>Michigan</em>, 576 U.&nbsp;S., at 760–764 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas</span>,&nbsp;J., concurring); <em>Buffington</em>, 598 U.&nbsp;S. ___ (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Gorsuch</span>,&nbsp;J.); B. Kavanaugh, Fixing Statutory Interpretation, 129 Harv. L.&nbsp;Rev. 2118, 2150–2154 (2016).  Even Justice Scalia, an early champion of <em>Chevron</em>, came to seriously doubt whether it could be reconciled with the APA.  See <em>Perez</em>, 575 U.&nbsp;S., at 109–110 (opinion concurring in judgment).  For its entire existence, <em>Chevron </em>has been a “rule in search of a justification,” <em>Knick</em>, 588 U.&nbsp;S., at 204, if it was ever coherent enough to be called a rule at all.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Experience has also shown that <em>Chevron </em>is unworkable.  The defining feature of its framework is the identification of statutory ambiguity, which requires deference at the doctrine’s second step.  But the concept of ambiguity has always evaded meaningful definition.  As Justice Scalia put the dilemma just five years after <em>Chevron</em> was decided: “How clear is clear?”  1989 Duke L.&nbsp;J., at 521.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> We are no closer to an answer to that question than we were four decades ago.  “&nbsp;‘[A]mbiguity’ is a term that may have different meanings for different judges.” <em> Exxon Mobil Corp.</em> v. <em>Allapattah Services, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"545 U. S. 546\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/545/546\">545 U.&nbsp;S. 546</a>, 572 (2005) (Stevens, J., dissenting).  One judge might see ambiguity everywhere; another might never encounter it.  Compare L. Silberman, Chevron—The Intersection of Law &amp; Policy, 58 Geo. Wash. L.&nbsp;Rev. 821, 822 (1990), with R. Kethledge, Ambiguities and Agency Cases: Reflections After (Almost) Ten Years on the Bench, 70 Vand. L.&nbsp;Rev. En Banc 315, 323 (2017).  A rule of law that is so wholly “in the eye of the &nbsp;beholder,” <em>Exxon Mobil Corp.</em>, 545 U.&nbsp;S., at 572 (Stevens, J., dissenting), invites different results in like cases and is therefore “arbitrary in practice,” <em>Gulfstream Aerospace Corp.</em> v. <em>Mayacamas Corp.</em>, <a aria-label=\"485 U. S. 271\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/485/271\">485 U.&nbsp;S. 271</a>, 283 (1988).  Such an impressionistic and malleable concept “cannot stand as an every-day test for allocating” interpretive authority between courts and agencies.  <em>Swift &amp; Co.</em> v. <em>Wickham</em>, <a aria-label=\"382 U. S. 111\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/382/111\">382 U.&nbsp;S. 111</a>, 125 (1965).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The dissent proves the point.  It tells us that a court should reach <em>Chevron</em>’s second step when it finds, “at the end of its interpretive work,” that “Congress has left an ambiguity or gap.”  <em>Post</em>, at 1–2.  (The Government offers a similar test.  See Brief for Respondents in No. 22–1219, pp.&nbsp;7, 10, 14; Tr. of Oral Arg. 113–114, 116.)  That is no guide at all.  Once more, the basic nature and meaning of a statute does not change when an agency happens to be involved.  Nor does it change just because the agency has happened to offer its interpretation through the sort of procedures necessary to obtain deference, or because the other preconditions for <em>Chevron</em> happen to be satisfied.  The statute still has a best meaning, necessarily discernible by a court deploying its full interpretive toolkit.  So for the dissent’s test to have any meaning, it must think that in an agency case (unlike in any other), a court should give up on its “interpretive work” before it has identified that best meaning.  But how does a court know when to do so?  On that point, the dissent leaves a gap of its own.  It protests only that some other interpretive tools—all with pedigrees more robust than <em>Chevron</em>’s, and all designed to help courts identify the meaning of a text rather than allow the Executive Branch to displace it—also apply to ambiguous texts.  See <em>post</em>, at 27.<em> </em>That this is all the dissent can come up with, after four decades of judicial experience attempting to identify ambiguity under <em>Chevron</em>, reveals the futility of the &nbsp;exercise.<a aria-label=\"reference 8 of Roberts Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-8\" id=\"OPINION_4-8ref\"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Because <em>Chevron </em>in its original, two-step form was so indeterminate and sweeping, we have instead been forced to clarify the doctrine again and again.  Our attempts to do so have only added to <em>Chevron</em>’s unworkability, transforming the original two-step into a dizzying breakdance.  See <em>Adams Fruit Co.</em>, 494 U.&nbsp;S., at 649–650; <em>Mead</em>, 533 U.&nbsp;S., at 226–227; <em>King</em>, 576 U.&nbsp;S., at 486; <em>Encino Motorcars</em>, 579 U.&nbsp;S., at 220; <em>Epic Systems</em>, 584 U.&nbsp;S., at 519–520; on and on.  And the doctrine continues to spawn difficult threshold questions that promise to further complicate the inquiry should <em>Chevron</em> be retained.  See, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Cargill</em> v. <em>Garland</em>, 57 F. 4th 447, 465–468 (CA5 2023) (plurality opinion) (May the Government waive reliance on <em>Chevron</em>?  Does <em>Chevron</em> apply to agency interpretations of statutes imposing criminal penalties?  Does <em>Chevron</em> displace the rule of lenity?), aff&nbsp;’d, 602 U.&nbsp;S. ___ (2024).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Four decades after its inception, <em>Chevron </em>has thus become an impediment, rather than an aid, to accomplishing the basic judicial task of “say[ing] what the law is.”  <em>Marbury</em>, 1 Cranch, at 177.  And its continuing import is far from clear.  Courts have often declined to engage with the doctrine, saying it makes no difference.  See n.&nbsp;7, <em>supra</em>.  And as noted, we have avoided deferring under <em>Chevron </em>since 2016.  That trend is nothing new; for decades, we have often declined to invoke <em>Chevron</em> even in those cases where it might appear to be applicable.  See W. Eskridge &amp; L. Baer, The Continuum of Deference: Supreme Court Treatment of Agency Statutory Interpretations From <em>Chevron</em> to <em>Hamdan</em>, 96 Geo. L.&nbsp;J. 1083, 1125 (2008).  At this point, all &nbsp;that remains of <em>Chevron </em>is a decaying husk with bold pretensions.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Nor has <em>Chevron</em> been the sort of “&nbsp;‘stable background’ rule” that fosters meaningful reliance.  <em>Post</em>, at 8, n.&nbsp;1 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Kagan, J.</span>) (quoting <em>Morrison</em> v. <em>National Australia Bank Ltd.</em>, <a aria-label=\"561 U. S. 247\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/561/247\">561 U.&nbsp;S. 247</a>, 261 (2010)).  Given our constant tinkering with and eventual turn away from <em>Chevron</em>, and its inconsistent application by the lower courts, it instead is hard to see how anyone—Congress included—could reasonably expect a court to rely on <em>Chevron </em>in any particular case.  And even if it were possible to predict accurately when courts will apply <em>Chevron</em>,<em> </em>the doctrine<em> </em>“does not provide ‘a clear or easily applicable standard, so arguments for reliance based on its clarity are misplaced.’&nbsp;”  <em>Janus</em>, 585 U.&nbsp;S., at 927 (quoting <em>South Dakota</em> v. <em>Wayfair, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"585 U. S. 162\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/585/162\">585 U.&nbsp;S. 162</a>, 186 (2018)).  To plan on <em>Chevron </em>yielding a particular result is to gamble not only that the doctrine will be invoked, but also that it will produce readily foreseeable outcomes and the stability that comes with them.  History has proved neither bet to be a winning proposition.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Rather than safeguarding reliance interests, <em>Chevron</em> affirmatively destroys them.  Under <em>Chevron</em>, a statutory ambiguity, no matter why it is there, becomes a license authorizing an agency to change positions as much as it likes, with “[u]nexplained inconsistency” being “at most .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a reason for holding an interpretation to be .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. arbitrary and capricious.”  <em>Brand X</em>, 545 U.&nbsp;S., at 981.  But statutory ambiguity, as we have explained, is not a reliable indicator of actual delegation of discretionary authority to agencies.  <em>Chevron </em>thus allows agencies to change course even when Congress has given them no power to do so.  By its sheer breadth, <em>Chevron</em> fosters unwarranted instability in the law, leaving those attempting to plan around agency action in an eternal fog of uncertainty.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"><em> Chevron</em> accordingly has undermined the very “rule of law” values that <em>stare decisis</em> exists to secure.  <em>Michigan</em> v. <em>Bay Mills Indian Community</em>, <a aria-label=\"572 U. S. 782\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/572/782\">572 U.&nbsp;S. 782</a>, 798 (2014).  And it<em> </em>cannot be constrained by admonishing courts to be extra careful, or by tacking on a new batch of conditions.  We would need to once again “revis[e] its theoretical basis .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in order to cure its practical deficiencies.”  <em>Montejo</em> v. <em>Louisiana</em>, <a aria-label=\"556 U. S. 778\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/556/778\">556 U.&nbsp;S. 778</a>, 792 (2009).  <em>Stare decisis</em> does not require us to do so, especially because any refinements we might make would only point courts back to their duties under the APA to “decide all relevant questions of law” and “interpret .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. statutory provisions.”  §706.  Nor is there any reason to wait helplessly for Congress to correct our mistake.  The Court has jettisoned many precedents that Congress likewise could have legislatively overruled.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Patterson</em> v. <em>McLean Credit Union</em>, <a aria-label=\"485 U. S. 617\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/485/617\">485 U.&nbsp;S. 617</a>, 618 (1988) (<em>per curiam</em>) (collecting cases).  And part of “judicial humility,” <em>post</em>, at 3, 25 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Kagan</span>, J.,), is admitting and in certain cases correcting our own mistakes, especially when those mistakes are serious, see <em>post</em>, at 8–9 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Gorsuch</span>, J.).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This is one of those cases.  <em>Chevron </em>was a judicial invention that required judges to disregard their statutory duties.  And the only way to “ensure that the law will not merely change erratically, but will develop in a principled and intelligible fashion,” <em>Vasquez</em> v. <em>Hillery</em>, <a aria-label=\"474 U. S. 254\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/474/254\">474 U.&nbsp;S. 254</a>, 265 (1986), is for us to leave <em>Chevron </em>behind.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> By doing so, however, we do not call into question prior cases that relied on the <em>Chevron</em> framework.  The holdings of those cases that specific agency actions are lawful—including the Clean Air Act holding of <em>Chevron </em>itself—are still subject to statutory <em>stare decisis</em> despite our change in interpretive methodology.  See <em>CBOCS West, Inc.</em> v. <em>Humphries</em>, <a aria-label=\"553 U. S. 442\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/553/442\">553 U.&nbsp;S. 442</a>, 457 (2008).  Mere reliance on <em>Chevron </em>cannot constitute a “&nbsp;‘special justification’&nbsp;” for overruling such a holding, because to say a precedent relied on <em>Chevron</em> is, at best, “just an argument that the precedent was wrongly decided.”  <em>Halliburton Co.</em> v. <em>Erica P. John Fund, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"573 U. S. 258\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/573/258\">573 U.&nbsp;S. 258</a>, 266 (2014) (quoting <em>Dickerson</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"530 U. S. 428\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/530/428\">530 U.&nbsp;S. 428</a>, 443 (2000)).  That is not enough to justify overruling a statutory precedent.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">*  *  *</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The dissent ends by quoting <em>Chevron</em>: “&nbsp;‘Judges are not experts in the field.’&nbsp;”  <em>Post</em>, at 31 (quoting 467 U.&nbsp;S., at 865).  That depends, of course, on what the “field” is.  If it is legal interpretation, that has been, “emphatically,” “the province and duty of the judicial department” for at least 221 years.  <em>Marbury</em>, 1 Cranch, at 177.  The rest of the dissent’s selected epigraph is that judges “&nbsp;‘are not part of either political branch.’&nbsp;”  <em>Post</em>, at 31 (quoting <em>Chevron</em>,<em> </em>467 U.&nbsp;S., at 865).  Indeed.  Judges have always been expected to apply their “judgment” <em>independent</em> of the political branches when interpreting the laws those branches enact.  The Federalist No. 78, at 523.  And one of those laws, the APA, bars judges from disregarding that responsibility just because an Executive Branch agency views a statute differently.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"><em> Chevron </em>is overruled.  Courts must exercise their independent judgment in deciding whether an agency has acted within its statutory authority, as the APA requires.  Careful attention to the judgment of the Executive Branch may help inform that inquiry.  And when a particular statute delegates authority to an agency consistent with constitutional limits, courts must respect the delegation, while ensuring that the agency acts within it.  But courts need not and under the APA may not defer to an agency interpretation of the law simply because a statute is ambiguous.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Because the D.&nbsp;C. and First Circuits relied on <em>Chevron </em>in deciding whether to uphold the Rule, their judgments are vacated, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"></p>\n<p class=\"flushrgtpara jy-right\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<h3 class=\"fnheader\">Notes</h3>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-1\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Roberts Opinion at reference 1\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-1ref\">1</a> &nbsp;For any landlubbers, “F/V” is simply the designation for a fishing vessel.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-2\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Roberts Opinion at reference 2\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-2ref\">2</a> &nbsp;Both petitions also presented questions regarding the consistency of the Rule with the MSA.

We did not grant certiorari with respect to those questions and thus do not reach them.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-3\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Roberts Opinion at reference 3\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-3ref\">3</a> &nbsp;The dissent plucks out <em>Gray</em>, <em>Hearst</em>, and—to “gild the lily,” in its telling—three more 1940s decisions, claiming they reflect the relevant historical tradition of judicial review.  <em>Post</em>, at 21–22, and n.&nbsp;6 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Kagan</span>, J.).  But it has no substantial response to the fact that <em>Gray</em> and <em>Hearst</em> themselves endorsed, implicitly in one case and explicitly in the next, the traditional rule that “questions of statutory interpretation .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. are for the courts to resolve, giving appropriate weight”—not outright deference—“to the judgment of those whose special duty is to administer the questioned statute.”  <em>Hearst</em>, 322 U.&nbsp;S., at 130–131.  And it fails to recognize the deep roots that<em> </em>this<em> </em>rule has in our Nation’s judicial tradition, to the limited extent it engages with that tradition at all.  See <em>post</em>, at 20–21, n.&nbsp;5.  Instead, like the Government, it strains to equate the “respect” or “weight” traditionally afforded to Executive Branch interpretations with binding deference.  See <em>ibid.</em>; Brief for Respondents in No. 22–1219, pp.&nbsp;21–24.  That supposed equivalence is a fiction.  The dissent’s cases establish that a “<em>contemporaneous</em> construction” shared by “not <em>only</em> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the courts” but also “the departments” could be “controlling,” <em>Schell’s Executors</em> v. <em>Fauché</em>, <a aria-label=\"138 U. S. 562\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/138/562\">138 U.&nbsp;S. 562</a>, 572 (1891) (emphasis added), and that courts might “lean in favor” of a “contemporaneous” and “continued” construction of the Executive Branch as strong evidence of a statute’s meaning, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Alabama Great Southern R. Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"142 U. S. 615\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/142/615\">142 U.&nbsp;S. 615</a>, 621 (1892).  They do not establish that Executive Branch interpretations of ambiguous statutes—no matter how inconsistent, late breaking, or flawed—always <em>bound</em> the courts.  In reality, a judge was never “bound to adopt the construction given by the head of a department.”  <em>Decatur </em>v. <em>Paulding</em>, 14 Pet. 497, 515 (1840).</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-4\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Roberts Opinion at reference 4\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-4ref\">4</a> &nbsp;The dissent observes that Section 706 does not say expressly that courts are to decide legal questions using “a <em>de&nbsp;novo</em> standard of review.”  <em>Post</em>, at 16.  That much is true.  But statutes can be sensibly understood only “by reviewing text in context.”  <em>Pulsifer</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"601 U. S. 124\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/601/124\">601 U.&nbsp;S. 124</a>, 133 (2024).  Since the start of our Republic, courts have “decide[d] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. questions of law” and “interpret[ed] constitutional and statutory provisions” by applying their own legal judgment.  §706.  Setting aside its misplaced reliance on <em>Gray </em>and <em>Hearst</em>,<em> </em>the dissent does not and could not deny that tradition.  But it nonetheless insists that to codify that tradition, Congress needed to expressly reject a sort of deference the courts had never before applied—and would not apply for several decades to come.  It did not.  “The notion that some things ‘go without saying’ applies to legislation just as it does to everyday life.”  <em>Bond</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"572 U.

Because the judicial power requires judges to exercise their independent judgment, the deference that <em>Chevron</em> requires contravenes Article III’s mandate.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Chevron</em> deference also permits the Executive Branch to exercise powers not given to it.  “When the Government is called upon to perform a function that requires an exercise of legislative, executive, or judicial power, only the vested recipient of that power can perform it.”  <em>Department of Transportation</em> v. <em>Association of American Railroads</em>, <a aria-label=\"575 U. S. 43\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/575/43\">575 U.&nbsp;S. 43</a>, 68 (2015) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas, J.</span>, concurring in judgment).  Because the Constitution gives the Executive Branch only “[t]he executive Power,” executive agencies may constitutionally exercise only that power.  Art.&nbsp;II, §1, cl.&nbsp;1.  But, <em>Chevron</em> gives agencies license to exercise judicial power.  By allowing agencies to definitively interpret laws so long as they are ambiguous, <em>Chevron</em> “transfer[s]” the Judiciary’s “interpretive judgment to the agency.”  <em>Perez</em>, 575 U.&nbsp;S., at 124 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas, J.</span>); see also <em>Baldwin</em>, 589 U.&nbsp;S., at ___ (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas, J.</span>) (slip op., at 4); <em>Michigan</em>, 576 U.&nbsp;S., at 761–762 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas, J.</span>); <em>post</em>, at 18 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Gorsuch, J.</span>, concurring).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Chevron</em> deference “cannot be salvaged” by recasting it as deference to an agency’s “formulation of policy.”  <em>Baldwin</em>, 589 U.&nbsp;S., at ___ (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas, J.</span>) (internal quotation marks omitted) (slip op., at 3).  If that were true, <em>Chevron</em> &nbsp;would mean that “agencies are unconstitutionally exercising ‘legislative Powers’ vested in Congress.”  <em>Baldwin</em>, 589 U.&nbsp;S., at ___ (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas</span>, J.) (slip op., at 3) (quoting Art. I, §1).  By “giv[ing] the force of law to agency pronouncements on matters of private conduct as to which Congress did not actually have an intent,” <em>Chevron</em> “permit[s] a body other than Congress to perform a function that requires an exercise of legislative power.”  <em>Michigan</em>, 576 U.&nbsp;S., at 762 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas, J.</span>) (internal quotation marks omitted).  No matter the gloss put on it, <em>Chevron</em> expands agencies’ power beyond the bounds of Article II by permitting them to exercise powers reserved to another branch of Government.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Chevron</em> deference was “not a harmless transfer of power.”  <em>Baldwin</em>, 589 U.&nbsp;S., at ___ (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas, J.</span>) (slip op., at 3).  “The Constitution carefully imposes structural constraints on all three branches, and the exercise of power free of those accompanying restraints subverts the design of the Constitution’s ratifiers.”  <em>Ibid</em>.  In particular, the Founders envisioned that “the courts [would] check the Executive by applying the correct interpretation of the law.”  <em>Id</em>., at ___ (slip op., at 4).  <em>Chevron</em> was thus a fundamental disruption of our separation of powers.  It improperly strips courts of judicial power by simultaneously increasing the power of executive agencies.  By overruling <em>Chevron</em>, we restore this aspect of our separation of powers.  To safeguard individual liberty, “[s]tructure is everything.”  A. Scalia, Foreword: The Importance of Structure in Constitutional Interpretation, 83 Notre Dame L.&nbsp;Rev. 1417, 1418 (2008).  Although the Court finally ends our 40-year misadventure with <em>Chevron</em> deference, its more profound problems should not be overlooked.  Regardless of what a statute says, the type of deference required by <em>Chevron</em> violates the Constitution.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<h3 class=\"fnheader\">Notes</h3>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"CONCUR_5-1\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Thomas Concurrence at reference 1\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#CONCUR_5-1ref\">1</a> *There is much to be commended in <span class=\"smallcaps\">Justice Gorsuch</span>’s careful consideration from first principles of the weight we should afford to our precedent.

Beginning in the mid-1980s, however, this Court experimented with a radically different approach.  Applying <em>Chevron</em> deference, judges began deferring to the views of executive agency officials about the meaning of federal statutes.  See <em>Chevron U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;A. Inc. </em>v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>,<em> </em><a aria-label=\"467 U.S. 837\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/467/837\">467 U.&nbsp;S. 837 (1984)</a>.  With time, the error of this approach became widely appreciated.  So much so that this Court has refused to apply <em>Chevron</em> deference since 2016.  Today, the Court places a tombstone on <em>Chevron</em> no one can miss.  In doing &nbsp;so, the Court returns judges to interpretive rules that have guided federal courts since the Nation’s founding.  I write separately to address why the proper application of the doctrine of <em>stare decisis</em> supports that course.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">I</h3>\n<h4 class=\"jy-center\">A</h4>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Today, the phrase “common law judge” may call to mind a judicial titan of the past who brilliantly devised new legal rules on his own.  The phrase “<em>stare decisis</em>” might conjure up a sense that judges who come later in time are strictly bound to follow the work of their predecessors.  But neither of those intuitions fairly describes the traditional common-law understanding of the judge’s role or the doctrine of <em>stare decisis</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> At common law, a judge’s charge to decide cases was not usually understood as a license to make new law.  For much of England’s early history, different rulers and different legal systems prevailed in different regions.  As England consolidated into a single kingdom governed by a single legal system, the judge’s task was to examine those pre-existing legal traditions and apply in the disputes that came to him those legal rules that were “common to the whole land and to all Englishmen.”  F. Maitland, Equity, Also the Forms of Action at Common Law 2 (1929).  That was “common law” judging.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This view of the judge’s role had consequences for the authority due judicial decisions.  Because a judge’s job was to find and apply the law, not make it, the “opinion of the judge” and “the law” were not considered “one and the same thing.”  1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 71 (1765) (Blackstone) (emphasis deleted).  A judge’s decision might bind the parties to the case at hand.  M. Hale, The History and Analysis of the Common Law of England 68 (1713) (Hale).  But none of that meant the judge had the power to “make a Law properly so called” for society &nbsp;at large, “for that only the King and Parliament can do.”  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Other consequences followed for the role precedent played in future judicial proceedings.  Because past decisions represented something “less than a Law,” they did not bind future judges.  <em>Ibid.</em>  At the same time, as Matthew Hale put it, a future judge could give a past decision “Weight” as “Evidence” of the law.  <em>Ibid.  </em>Expressing the same idea, William Blackstone conceived of judicial precedents as “evidence” of “the common law.”  1 Blackstone 69, 71.  And much like other forms of evidence, precedents at common law were thought to vary in the weight due them.  Some past decisions might supply future courts with considerable guidance.  But others might be entitled to lesser weight, not least because judges are no less prone to error than anyone else and they may sometimes “mistake” what the law demands.  <em>Id.</em>, at 71 (emphasis deleted).  In cases like that, both men thought, a future judge should not rotely repeat a past mistake but instead “vindicate” the law “from misrepresentation.”  <em>Id</em>., at 70<em>.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> When examining past decisions as evidence of the law, common law judges did not, broadly speaking, afford overwhelming weight to any “single precedent.”  J.&nbsp;Baker, An Introduction to English Legal History 209–210 (5th ed. 2019).  Instead, a prior decision’s persuasive force depended in large measure on its “Consonancy and Congruity with Resolutions and Decisions of former Times.”  Hale 68.  An individual decision might reflect the views of one court at one moment in time, but a consistent line of decisions representing the wisdom of many minds across many generations was generally considered stronger evidence of the law’s meaning.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> With this conception of precedent<em> </em>in mind, Lord Mansfield cautioned against elevating “particular cases” above the “general principles” that “run through the cases, and govern the decision of them.”  <em>Rust</em> v. <em>Cooper</em>, 2 Cowp. 629, &nbsp;632, 98 Eng. Rep. 1277, 1279 (K. B. 1777).  By discarding aberrational rulings and pursuing instead the mainstream of past decisions, he observed, the common law tended over time to “wor[k] itself pure.” <em>Omychund</em> v. <em>Barker</em>, 1 Atk. 22, 33, 26 Eng. Rep. 15, 23 (Ch. 1744) (emphasis deleted).  Reflecting similar thinking, Edmund Burke offered five principles for the evaluation of past judicial decisions: “They ought to be shewn; first, to be numerous and not scattered here and there;—secondly, concurrent and not contradictory and mutually destructive;—thirdly, to be made in good and constitutional times;—fourthly, not to be made to serve an occasion;—and fifthly, to be agreeable to the general tenor of legal principles.”  Speech of Dec. 23, 1790, in 3 The Speeches of the Right Honourable Edmund Burke 513 (1816).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Not only did different decisions carry different weight, so did different language within a decision.  An opinion’s holding and the reasoning essential to it (the <em>ratio decidendi</em>) merited careful attention. <em> </em>Dicta, stray remarks, and digressions warranted less weight.  See N. Duxbury, The Intricacies of Dicta and Dissent 19–24 (2021) (Duxbury).  These were no more than “the vapours and fumes of law.”  F. Bacon, The Lord Keeper’s Speech in the Exchequer (1617), in 2 The Works of Francis Bacon 478 (B. Montagu ed. 1887) (Bacon).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> That is not to say those “vapours” were worthless.  Often dicta might provide the parties to a particular dispute a “fuller understanding of the court’s decisional path or related areas of concern.”  B. Garner et&nbsp;al., The Law of Judicial Precedent 65 (2016) (Precedent).  Dicta might also provide future courts with a source of “thoughtful advice.”  <em>Ibid.</em>  But future courts had to be careful not to treat every “hasty expression .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as a serious and deliberate opinion.” <em>Steel</em> v. <em>Houghton</em>, 1 Bl. H. 51, 53, 126 Eng. Rep. 32, 33 (C.&nbsp;P. 1788).  To do so would work an “injustice to [the] memory” of their predecessors who could not expect judicial &nbsp;remarks issued in one context to apply perfectly in others, perhaps especially ones they could not foresee.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Also, the limits of the adversarial process, a distinctive feature of English law, had to be borne in mind.  When a single judge or a small panel reached a decision in a case, they did so based on the factual record and legal arguments the parties at hand have chosen to develop.  Attuned to those constraints, future judges had to proceed with an open mind to the possibility that different facts and different legal arguments might dictate different outcomes in later disputes.  See Duxbury 19–24.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Necessarily, this represents just a quick sketch of traditional common-law understandings of the judge’s role and the place of precedent in it.  It focuses, too, on the horizontal, not vertical, force of judicial precedents.  But there are good reasons to think that the common law’s understandings of judges and precedent outlined above crossed the Atlantic and informed the nature of the “judicial Power” the Constitution vests in federal courts.  Art.&nbsp;III, §1.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Not only was the Constitution adopted against the backdrop of these understandings and, in light of that alone, they may provide evidence of what the framers meant when they spoke of the “judicial Power.”  Many other, more specific provisions in the Constitution reflect much the same distinction between lawmaking and lawfinding functions the common law did.  The Constitution provides that its terms may be amended only through certain prescribed democratic processes.  Art. V.  It vests the power to enact federal legislation exclusively in the people’s elected representatives in Congress.  Art. I, §1.  Meanwhile, the Constitution describes the judicial power as the power to resolve cases and controversies.  Art. III, §2, cl.&nbsp;1.  As well, it delegates that authority to life-tenured judges, see §1, an assignment that would have made little sense if judges could &nbsp;usurp lawmaking powers vested in periodically elected representatives.  But one that makes perfect sense if what is sought is a neutral party “to interpret and apply” the law without fear or favor in a dispute between others.  2 The Works of James Wilson 161 (J. Andrews ed. 1896) (Wilson); see <em>Osborn</em> v. <em>Bank of United States</em>, 9 Wheat. 738, 866 (1824).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The constrained view of the judicial power that runs through our Constitution carries with it familiar implications, ones the framers readily acknowledged.  James Madison, for example, proclaimed that it would be a “fallacy” to suggest that judges or their precedents could “repeal or alter” the Constitution or the laws of the United States.  Letter to N. Trist (Dec. 1831), in 9 The Writings of James Madison 477 (G. Hunt ed. 1910).  A court’s opinion, James Wilson added, may be thought of as “effective la[w]” “[a]s to the parties.”  Wilson 160–161.  But as in England, Wilson said, a prior judicial decision could serve in a future dispute only as “evidence” of the law’s proper construction.  <em>Id</em>., at 160; accord, 1 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law 442–443 (1826).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The framers also recognized that the judicial power described in our Constitution implies, as the judicial power did in England, a power (and duty) of discrimination when it comes to assessing the “evidence” embodied in past decisions.  So, for example, Madison observed that judicial rulings “<em>repeatedly confirmed&nbsp;</em>” may supply better evidence of the law’s meaning than isolated or aberrant ones.  Letter to C. Ingersoll (June 1831), in 4 Letters and Other Writings of James Madison 184 (1867) (emphasis added).  Extending the thought, Thomas Jefferson believed it would often take “numerous decisions” for the meaning of new statutes to become truly “settled.”  Letter to S. Jones (July 1809), in 12 The Writings of Thomas Jefferson 299 (A. Bergh ed. 1907).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> From the start, too, American courts recognized that not everything found in a prior decision was entitled to equal &nbsp;weight.  As Chief Justice Marshall warned, “It is a maxim not to be disregarded, that general expressions, in every opinion, are to be taken in connection with the case in which those expressions are used.”  <em>Cohens</em> v. <em>Virginia</em>, 6 Wheat. 264, 399 (1821).  To the extent a past court offered views “beyond the case,” those expressions “may be respected” in a later case “but ought not to control the judgment.”  <em>Ibid.  </em>One “obvious” reason for this, Marshall continued, had to do with the limits of the adversarial process we inherited from England:  Only “[t]he question actually before the Court is investigated with care, and considered in its full extent.  Other principles which may serve to illustrate it, are considered in their relation to the case decided, but their possible bearing on all other cases is seldom completely investigated.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 399–400.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Abraham Lincoln championed these traditional understandings in his debates with Stephen Douglas.  Douglas took the view that a single decision of this Court—no matter how flawed—could definitively resolve a contested issue for everyone and all time.  Those who thought otherwise, he said, “aim[ed] a deadly blow to our whole Republican system of government.”  Speech at Springfield, Ill. (June 26, 1857), in 2 The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln 401 (R. Basler ed. 1953) (Lincoln Speech).  But Lincoln knew better.  While accepting that judicial decisions “absolutely determine” the rights of the parties to a court’s judgment, he refused to accept that any single judicial decision could “fully settl[e]” an issue, particularly when that decision departs from the Constitution.  <em>Id</em>., at 400–401.  In cases such as these, Lincoln explained, “it is not resistance, it is not factious, it is not even disrespectful, to treat [the decision] as not having yet quite established a settled doctrine for the country.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 401.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> After the Civil War, the Court echoed some of these same points.  It stressed that every statement in a judicial opin&nbsp;ion “must be taken in connection with its immediate context,” <em>In re Ayers</em>, <a aria-label=\"123 U. S. 443\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/123/443\">123&nbsp;U.&nbsp;S. 443</a>, 488 (1887), and stray “remarks” must not be elevated above the written law, see <em>The Belfast</em>, 7 Wall. 624, 641 (1869); see also, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>Trebilcock</em> v. <em>Wilson</em>, 12 Wall. 687, 692–693 (1872); <em>Mason</em> v. <em>Eldred</em>, 6 Wall. 231, 236–238 (1868).  During Chief Justice Chase’s tenure, it seems a Justice writing the Court’s majority opinion would generally work alone and present his work orally and in summary form to his colleagues at conference, which meant that other Justices often did not even review the opinion prior to publication.  6 C. Fairman, History of the Supreme Court of the United States 69–70 (1971).  The Court could proceed in this way because it understood that a single judicial opinion may resolve a “case or controversy,” and in so doing it may make “effective law” for the parties, but it does not legislate for the whole of the country and is not to be confused with laws that do.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">C</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> From all this, I see at least three lessons about the doctrine of <em>stare decisis</em> relevant to the decision before us today.  Each concerns a form of judicial humility.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>First</em>,<em> </em>a past decision may bind the parties to a dispute, but it provides this Court no authority in future cases to depart from what the Constitution or laws of the United States ordain.  Instead, the Constitution promises, the American people are sovereign and they alone may, through democratically responsive processes, amend our foundational charter or revise federal legislation.  Unelected judges enjoy no such power.  Part I–B, <em>supra</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Recognizing as much, this Court has often said that <em>stare decisis</em> is not an “&nbsp;‘inexorable command.’&nbsp;”  <em>State Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Khan</em>, <a aria-label=\"522 U. S. 3\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/522/3\">522 U.&nbsp;S. 3</a>, 20 (1997).  And from time to time it has found it necessary to correct its past mistakes.  When it comes to correcting errors of constitutional interpretation, the Court has stressed the importance of doing so, for they &nbsp;can be corrected otherwise only through the amendment process.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal.</em> v. <em>Hyatt</em>, <a aria-label=\"587 U. S. 230\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/587/230\">587 U.&nbsp;S. 230</a>, 248 (2019).  When it comes to fixing errors of statutory interpretation, the Court has proceeded perhaps more circumspectly.  But in that field, too, it has overruled even longstanding but “flawed” decisions.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc.</em> v. <em>PSKS, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"551 U. S. 877\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/551/877\">551 U.&nbsp;S. 877</a>, 904, 907 (2007).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Recent history illustrates all this.  During the tenures of Chief Justices Warren and Burger, it seems this Court overruled an average of around three cases per Term, including roughly 50 statutory precedents between the 1960s and 1980s alone.  See W. Eskridge, Overruling Statutory Precedents, 76 Geo. L.&nbsp;J. 1361, 1427–1434 (1988) (collecting cases).  Many of these decisions came in settings no less consequential than today’s.  In recent years, we have not approached the pace set by our predecessors, overruling an average of just one or two prior decisions each Term.<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Gorsuch Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_6-1\" id=\"CONCUR_6-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a>  But the point remains:  Judicial decisions inconsistent with the written law do not inexorably control.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Second</em>, another lesson tempers the first.  While judicial decisions may not supersede or revise the Constitution or federal statutory law, they merit our “respect as embodying the considered views of those who have come before.”  <em>Ramos </em>v. <em>Louisiana</em>,<em> </em><a aria-label=\"590 U. S. 83\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/590/83\">590 U.&nbsp;S. 83</a>, 105 (2020).  As a matter of professional responsibility, a judge must not only avoid confusing his writings with the law.  When a case comes before him, he must also weigh his view of what the law demands against the thoughtful views of his predecessors.  After all, “[p]recedent is a way of accumulating and passing down the learning of past generations, a font of established wisdom &nbsp;richer than what can be found in any single judge or panel of judges.”  Precedent 9.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Doubtless, past judicial decisions may, as they always have, command “greater or less authority as precedents, according to circumstances.”  Lincoln Speech 401.  But, like English judges before us, we have long turned to familiar considerations to guide our assessment of the weight due a past decision.  So, for example, as this Court has put it, the weight due a precedent may depend on the quality of its reasoning, its consistency with related decisions, its workability, and reliance interests that have formed around it.  See <em>Ramos</em>,<em> </em>590 U.&nbsp;S., at 106.  The first factor recognizes that the primary power of any precedent lies in its power to persuade—and poorly reasoned decisions may not provide reliable evidence of the law’s meaning.  The second factor reflects the fact that a precedent is more likely to be correct and worthy of respect when it reflects the time-tested wisdom of generations than when it sits “unmoored” from surrounding law.  <em>Ibid.  </em>The remaining factors, like workability and reliance, do not often supply reason enough on their own to abide a flawed decision, for almost any past decision is likely to benefit some group eager to keep things as they are and content with how things work.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>id</em>., at 108.  But these factors can sometimes serve functions similar to the others, by pointing to clues that may suggest a past decision is right in ways not immediately obvious to the individual judge.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> When asking whether to follow or depart from a precedent, some judges deploy adverbs.  They speak of whether or not a precedent qualifies as “demonstrably erroneous,” <em>Gamble</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"587 U. S. 678\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/587/678\">587 U.&nbsp;S. 678</a>, 711 (2019) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas, J.</span>, concurring), or “egregiously wrong,” <em>Ramos</em>, 590 U.&nbsp;S., at 121 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Kavanaugh, J.</span>, concurring in part).  But the emphasis the adverb imparts is not meant for dramatic effect.  It seeks to serve instead as a reminder of a more substantive lesson.  The lesson that, in assessing the weight &nbsp;due a past decision, a judge is not to be guided by his own impression alone, but must self-consciously test his views against those who have come before, open to the possibility that a precedent might be correct in ways not initially apparent to him.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Third</em>, it would be a mistake to read judicial opinions like statutes.  Adopted through a robust and democratic process, statutes often apply in all their particulars to all persons.  By contrast, when judges reach a decision in our adversarial system, they render a judgment based only on the factual record and legal arguments the parties at hand have chosen to develop.  A later court assessing a past decision must therefore appreciate the possibility that different facts and different legal arguments may dictate a different outcome.  They must appreciate, too, that, like anyone else, judges are “innately digressive,” and their opinions may sometimes offer stray asides about a wider topic that may sound nearly like legislative commands.  Duxbury 4.  Often, enterprising counsel seek to exploit such statements to maximum effect.  See <em>id</em>., at 25.  But while these digressions may sometimes contain valuable counsel, they remain “vapours and fumes of law,” Bacon 478, and cannot “control the judgment in a subsequent suit,” <em>Cohens</em>, 6 Wheat., at 399.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> These principles, too, have long guided this Court and others.  As Judge Easterbrook has put it, an “opinion is not a comprehensive code; it is just an explanation for the Court’s disposition.  Judicial opinions must not be confused with statutes, and general expressions must be read in light of the subject under consideration.”  <em>United States </em>v. <em>Skoien</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/614_F.3d_638\">614 F.&nbsp;3d 638</a>, 640 (CA7 2010) (en banc); see also <em>Reiter</em> v. <em>Sonotone Corp.</em>, <a aria-label=\"442 U. S. 330\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/442/330\">442 U.&nbsp;S. 330</a>, 341 (1979) (stressing that an opinion is not “a statute,” and its language should not “be parsed” as if it were); <em>Nevada </em>v. <em>Hicks</em>, <a aria-label=\"533 U. S. 353\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/533/353\">533 U.&nbsp;S. 353</a>, 372 (2001) (same).  If <em>stare decisis</em> counsels respect for the thinking of those who have come before, it also counsels against doing an “injustice to [their] memory” by &nbsp;overreliance on their every word.  <em>Steel</em>, 1 Bl. H., at 53, 126 Eng. Rep., at 33.  As judges, “[w]e neither expect nor hope that our successors will comb” through our opinions, searching for delphic answers to matters we never fully explored.  <em>Brown </em>v. <em> Davenport</em>, <a aria-label=\"596 U. S. 118\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/596/118\">596 U.&nbsp;S. 118</a>, 141 (2022).  To proceed otherwise risks “turn[ing] <em>stare decisis</em> from a tool of judicial humility into one of judicial hubris.”  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">II</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Turning now directly to the question what <em>stare decisis</em> effect <em>Chevron</em> deference warrants, each of these lessons seem to me to weigh firmly in favor of the course the Court charts today: Lesson 1, because <em>Chevron </em>deference contravenes the law Congress prescribed in the Administrative Procedure Act.  Lesson 2, because <em>Chevron </em>deference runs against mainstream currents in our law regarding the separation of powers, due process, and centuries-old interpretive rules that fortify those constitutional commitments.  And Lesson 3, because<em> </em>to hold otherwise would effectively require us to endow stray statements in <em>Chevron</em> with the authority of statutory language, all while ignoring more considered language in that same decision and the teachings of experience.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">A</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Start with Lesson 1.  The Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 (APA) directs a “reviewing court” to “decide all relevant questions of law” and “interpret” relevant “constitutional and statutory provisions.”  <a aria-label=\"5 USC 706\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/706\">5&nbsp;U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §706</a>.  When applying <em>Chevron</em> deference, reviewing courts do not interpret all relevant statutory provisions and decide all relevant questions of law.  Instead, judges abdicate a large measure of that responsibility in favor of agency officials.  Their interpretations of “ambiguous” laws control even when those interpretations are at odds with the fairest reading of the law an independent “reviewing court” can muster.  Agency &nbsp;officials, too, may change their minds about the law’s meaning at any time, even when Congress has not amended the relevant statutory language in any way.  <em>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn.</em> v. <em>Brand X Internet Services</em>, <a aria-label=\"545 U. S. 967\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/545/967\">545 U.&nbsp;S. 967</a>, 982–983 (2005).  And those officials may even disagree with and effectively overrule not only their own past interpretations of a law but a court’s past interpretation as well.  <em>Ibid.  </em>None of that is consistent with the APA’s clear mandate.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The hard fact is <em>Chevron</em> “did not even bother to cite” the APA, let alone seek to apply its terms.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Mead Corp.</em>, <a aria-label=\"533 U. S. 218\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/533/218\">533 U.&nbsp;S. 218</a>, 241 (2001) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  Instead, as even its most ardent defenders have conceded, <em>Chevron</em> deference rests upon a “<em>fictionalized</em> statement of legislative desire,” namely, a judicial supposition that Congress implicitly wishes judges to defer to executive agencies’ interpretations of the law even when it has said nothing of the kind.  D. Barron &amp; E. Kagan, Chevron’s Nondelegation Doctrine, 2001 S.&nbsp;Ct. Rev. 201, 212 (Kagan) (emphasis added).  As proponents see it, that fiction represents a “policy judgmen[t] about what .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. make[s] for good government.”  <em>Ibid.</em><a aria-label=\"reference 2 of Gorsuch Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_6-2\" id=\"CONCUR_6-2ref\"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a>  But in our democracy unelected judges possess no authority to elevate their own fictions over the laws adopted by the Nation’s elected representatives.  Some might think the legal directive Congress provided in the APA unwise; some might think a different arrangement preferable.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>post</em>, at 9–11 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Kagan, J.</span>, dissenting).  But it is Congress’s view of “good government,” not ours, that controls.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; Much more could be said about <em>Chevron</em>’s inconsistency with the APA.  But I have said it in the past.  See <em>Buffington </em>v.<em> McDonough</em>, 598 U.&nbsp;S. ___, ___–___ (2022) (opinion dissenting from denial of certiorari) (slip op., at 5–6); <em>Gutierrez-Brizuela</em> v. <em>Lynch</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/834_F.3d_1142\">834 F.&nbsp;3d 1142</a>, 1151–1153 (CA10 2016) (concurring opinion).  And the Court makes many of the same points at length today.  See <em>ante</em>, at 18–22.  For present purposes, the short of it is that continuing to abide <em>Chevron</em> deference would require us to transgress the first lesson of <em>stare decisis</em>—the humility required of judges to recognize that our decisions must yield to the laws adopted by the people’s elected representatives.<a aria-label=\"reference 3 of Gorsuch Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_6-3\" id=\"CONCUR_6-3ref\"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Lesson 2 cannot rescue <em>Chevron</em> deference.  If <em>stare decisis</em> calls for judicial humility in the face of the written law, it also cautions us to test our present conclusions carefully against the work of our predecessors.  At the same time and as we have seen, this second form of humility counsels us to remember that precedents that have won the endorsement of judges across many generations, demonstrated coherence with our broader law, and weathered the tests of time and experience are entitled to greater consideration than those that have not.  See Part I, <em>supra</em>.  Viewed by each of these lights, the case for <em>Chevron</em> deference only grows weaker still.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">&nbsp;1</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"><em> </em>Start with a look to how our predecessors traditionally understood the judicial role in disputes over a law’s meaning.  From the Nation’s founding, they considered “[t]he interpretation of the laws” in cases and controversies “the proper and peculiar province of the courts.”  The Federalist No. 78, p.&nbsp;467 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton).  Perhaps the Court’s most famous early decision reflected exactly that view.  There, Chief Justice Marshall declared it “emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.”  <em>Marbury</em>, 1 Cranch, at 177.  For judges “have neither FORCE nor WILL but merely judgment”—and an obligation to exercise that judgment independently.  The Federalist No. 78, at 465.  No matter how “disagreeable that duty may be,” this Court has said, a judge “is not at liberty to surrender, or to waive it.”  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Dickson</em>, 15 Pet. 141, 162 (1841) (Story, J.).  This duty of independent judgment is perhaps “the defining characteristi[c] of Article III judges.”  <em>Stern </em>v. <em>Marshall</em>, <a aria-label=\"564 U. S. 462\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/564/462\">564 U.&nbsp;S. 462</a>, 483 (2011).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> To be sure, this Court has also long extended “great respect” to the “contemporaneous” and consistent views of the coordinate branches about the meaning of a statute’s terms.  <em>Edwards’ Lessee</em> v. <em>Darby</em>, 12 Wheat. 206, 210 (1827); see also <em>McCulloch</em> v. <em>Maryland</em>, 4 Wheat. 316, 401 (1819); <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Laird</em>, 1 Cranch 299, 309 (1803).<a aria-label=\"reference 4 of Gorsuch Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_6-4\" id=\"CONCUR_6-4ref\"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup></a>  But traditionally, that did not mean a court had to “defer” to any “reasonable” &nbsp;construction of an “ambiguous” law that an executive agency might offer.  It did not mean that the government could propound a “reasonable” view of the law’s meaning one day, a different one the next, and bind the judiciary always to its latest word.  Nor did it mean the executive could displace a pre-existing judicial construction of a statute’s terms, replace it with its own, and effectively overrule a judicial precedent in the process.  Put simply, this Court was “not bound” by any and all reasonable “administrative construction[s]” of ambiguous statutes when resolving cases and controversies.  <em>Burnet</em> v. <em>Chicago Portrait Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"285 U. S. 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/285/1\">285 U.&nbsp;S. 1</a>, 16 (1932).  While the executive’s consistent and contemporaneous views warranted respect, they “by no means control[led] the action or the opinion of this court in expounding the law with reference to the rights of parties litigant before them.”  <em>Irvine</em> v. <em>Marshall</em>, 20 How. 558, 567 (1858); see also A. Bamzai, The Origins of Judicial Deference to Executive Interpretation, 126 Yale L. J. 908, 987 (2017).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Sensing how jarringly inconsistent <em>Chevron</em> is with this Court’s many longstanding precedents discussing the nature of the judicial role in disputes over the law’s meaning, the government and dissent struggle for a response.  The best they can muster is a handful of cases from the early 1940s in which, they say, this Court first “put [deference] principles into action.”  <em>Post</em>, at 21 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Kagan, J.</span>, dissenting).  And, admittedly, for a period this Court toyed with a form of deference akin to <em>Chevron</em>, at least for so-called mixed questions of law and fact.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Gray</em> v. <em>Powell</em>, <a aria-label=\"314 U. S. 402\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/314/402\">314 U.&nbsp;S. 402</a>, 411–412 (1941); <em>NLRB</em> v. <em>Hearst Publications, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"322 U. S. 111\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/322/111\">322 U.&nbsp;S. 111</a>, 131 (1944).  But, as the Court details, even that limited experiment did not last.  See <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 10–12<em>.</em>  Justice<em> </em>Roberts, in his <em>Gray </em>dissent, decried these decisions for “abdicat[ing our] function as a court of review” and “complete[ly] revers[ing] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the normal and usual method of construing a statute.”  314 U.&nbsp;S., at 420–421.  And just a few years later, in <em>Skidmore</em> v. <em>Swift &amp; Co.</em>, 323 &nbsp;U.&nbsp;S. 134 (1944), the Court returned to its time-worn path.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Echoing themes that had run throughout our law from its start, Justice Robert H. Jackson wrote for the Court in <em>Skidmore</em>.  There, he said, courts may extend respectful consideration to another branch’s interpretation of the law, but the weight due those interpretations must always “depend upon the[ir] thoroughness .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;, the validity of [their] reasoning, [their] consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give [them] power to persuade.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 140.  In another case the same year, and again writing for the Court, Justice Jackson expressly rejected a call for a judge-made doctrine of deference much like <em>Chevron</em>, offering that, “[i]f Congress had deemed it necessary or even appropriate” for courts to “defe[r] to administrative construction[,] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it would not have been at a loss for words to say so.”  <em>Davies Warehouse Co.</em> v. <em>Bowles</em>, <a aria-label=\"321 U. S. 144\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/321/144\">321 U.&nbsp;S. 144</a>, 156 (1944).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> To the extent proper respect for precedent demands, as it always has, special respect for longstanding and mainstream decisions, <em>Chevron </em>scores badly.  It represented not a continuation of a long line of decisions but a break from them.  Worse, it did not merely depart from our precedents.  More nearly, <em>Chevron</em> defied them.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">2</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Consider next how uneasily <em>Chevron</em> deference sits alongside so many other settled aspects of our law.  Having witnessed first-hand King George’s efforts to gain influence and control over colonial judges, see Declaration of Independence ¶ 11, the framers made a considered judgment to build judicial independence into the Constitution’s design.  They vested the judicial power in decisionmakers with life tenure.  Art.&nbsp;III, §1.  They placed the judicial salary beyond political control during a judge’s tenure.  <em>Ibid.</em>  And they rejected any proposal that would subject judicial decisions to review by political actors.  The Federalist No. 81, at 482; <em>United States</em> v. <em>Hansen</em>, <a aria-label=\"599 U. S. 762\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/599/762\">599 U.&nbsp;S. 762</a>, 786–791 (2023) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas, J.</span>, concurring).  All of this served to ensure the same thing: “A fair trial in a fair tribunal.”  <em>In&nbsp;re Murchison</em>, <a aria-label=\"349 U. S. 133\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/349/133\">349 U.&nbsp;S. 133</a>, 136 (1955).  One in which impartial judges, not those currently wielding power in the political branches, would “say what the law is” in cases coming to court.  <em>Marbury</em>, 1 Cranch, at 177.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Chevron</em> deference undermines all that.  It precludes courts from exercising the judicial power vested in them by Article III to say what the law is.  It forces judges to abandon the best reading of the law in favor of views of those presently holding the reins of the Executive Branch.  It requires judges to change, and change again, their interpretations of the law as and when the government demands.  And that transfer of power has exactly the sort of consequences one might expect.  Rather than insulate adjudication from power and politics to ensure a fair hearing “without respect to persons” as the federal judicial oath demands, <a aria-label=\"28 USC 453\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/453\">28 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §453</a>, <em>Chevron </em>deference requires courts to “place a finger on the scales of justice in favor of the most powerful of litigants, the federal government.”  <em>Buffington</em>, 598 U.&nbsp;S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).  Along the way, <em>Chevron</em> deference guarantees “systematic bias” in favor of whichever political party currently holds the levers of executive power.  P. Hamburger, <em>Chevron</em> Bias, 84 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 1187, 1212 (2016).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Chevron </em>deference undermines other aspects of our settled law, too.  In this country, we often boast that the Constitution’s promise of due process of law, see Amdts. 5, 14, means that “&nbsp;‘no man can be a judge in his own case.’&nbsp;”  <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Pennsylvania</em>, <a aria-label=\"579 U. S. 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/579/1\">579 U.&nbsp;S. 1</a>, 8–9 (2016); <em>Calder</em> v. <em>Bull</em>, 3 Dall. 386, 388 (1798) (opinion of Chase, J.).  That principle, of course, has even deeper roots, tracing far back into the common law where it was known by the Latin maxim <em>nemo iudex in causa sua</em>.  See 1 E. Coke, Institutes &nbsp;of the Laws of England §212, *141a.  Yet, under the <em>Chevron</em> regime, all that means little, for executive agencies may effectively judge the scope of their own lawful powers.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Arlington </em>v.<em> FCC</em>, <a aria-label=\"569 U. S. 290\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/569/290\">569 U.&nbsp;S. 290</a>, 296–297 (2013).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Traditionally, as well, courts have sought to construe statutes as a reasonable reader would “when the law was made.”  Blackstone 59; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fisher</em>, 2 Cranch 358, 386 (1805).  Today, some call this “textualism.”  But really it’s a very old idea, one that constrains judges to a lawfinding rather than lawmaking role by focusing their work on the statutory text, its linguistic context, and various canons of construction.  In that way, textualism serves as an essential guardian of the due process promise of fair notice.  If a judge could discard an old meaning and assign a new one to a law’s terms, all without any legislative revision, how could people ever be sure of the rules that bind them?  <em>New Prime Inc. </em>v. <em>Oliveira</em>, <a aria-label=\"586 U. S. 105\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/586/105\">586 U.&nbsp;S. 105</a>, 113 (2019).  Were the rules otherwise, Blackstone warned, the people would be rendered “slaves to their magistrates.”  4&nbsp;Blackstone 371.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Yet, replace “magistrates” with “bureaucrats,” and Blackstone’s fear becomes reality when courts employ <em>Chevron</em> deference.  Whenever we confront an ambiguity in the law, judges do not seek to resolve it impartially according to the best evidence of the law’s original meaning.  Instead, we resort to a far cruder heuristic: “The reasonable bureaucrat always wins.”  And because the reasonable bureaucrat may change his mind year-to-year and election-to-election, the people can never know with certainty what new “interpretations” might be used against them.  This “fluid” approach to statutory interpretation is “as much a trap for the innocent as the ancient laws of Caligula,” which were posted so high up on the walls and in print so small that ordinary people could never be sure what they required.  <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cardiff</em>, <a aria-label=\"344 U. S. 174\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/344/174\">344 U.&nbsp;S. 174</a>, 176 (1952).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; The ancient rule of lenity is still another of <em>Chevron</em>’s victims.  Since the founding, American courts have construed ambiguities in penal laws against the government and with lenity toward affected persons.  <em>Wooden</em> v. <em>United</em> <em>States</em>, <a aria-label=\"595 U. S. 360\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/595/360\">595 U.&nbsp;S. 360</a>, 388–390 (2022) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Gorsuch, J.</span>, concurring in judgment).  That principle upholds due process by safeguarding individual liberty in the face of ambiguous laws.  <em>Ibid.  </em>And it fortifies the separation of powers by keeping the power of punishment firmly “&nbsp;‘in the legislative, not in the judicial department.’&nbsp;”  <em>Id.</em>, at 391 (quoting <em>United States</em> v. <em>Wiltberger</em>, 5 Wheat. 76, 95 (1820)).  But power begets power.  And pressing <em>Chevron </em>deference as far as it can go, the government has sometimes managed to leverage “ambiguities” in the written law to penalize conduct Congress never clearly proscribed.  Compare <em>Guedes </em>v. <em>ATF</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/920_F.3d_1\">920 F.&nbsp;3d 1</a>, 27–28, 31 (CADC 2019), with <em>Garland </em>v. <em>Cargill</em>, <a aria-label=\"602 U.S. 604\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/602/604\">602 U.&nbsp;S. 604 (2024)</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In all these ways, <em>Chevron</em>’s fiction has led us to a strange place.  One where authorities long thought reserved for Article III are transferred to Article II, where the scales of justice are tilted systematically in favor of the most powerful, where legal demands can change with every election even though the laws do not, and where the people are left to guess about their legal rights and responsibilities.  So much tension with so many foundational features of our legal order is surely one more sign that we have “taken a wrong turn along the way.”  <em>Kisor</em> v. <em>Wilkie</em>, <a aria-label=\"588 U. S. 558\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/588/558\">588 U.&nbsp;S. 558</a>, 607 (2019) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Gorsuch, J.,</span> concurring in judgment).<a aria-label=\"reference 5 of Gorsuch Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_6-5\" id=\"CONCUR_6-5ref\"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">&nbsp;3</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Finally, consider workability and reliance.  If, as I have sought to suggest, these factors may sometimes serve as useful proxies for the question whether a precedent comports with the historic tide of judicial practice or represents an aberrational mistake, see Part I–C, <em>supra</em>, they certainly do here.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Take <em>Chevron</em>’s “workability.”  Throughout its short life, this Court has been forced to supplement and revise <em>Chevron</em> so many times that no one can agree on how many “steps” it requires, nor even what each of those “steps” entails.  Some suggest that the analysis begins with “step zero” (perhaps itself a tell), an innovation that traces to <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mead Corp.</em>, <a aria-label=\"533 U. S. 218\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/533/218\">533 U.&nbsp;S. 218</a>.  <em>Mead</em> held that, before even considering whether <em>Chevron</em> applies, a court must determine whether Congress meant to delegate to the agency authority to interpret the law in a given field.  533 U.&nbsp;S., at 226–227. <em> </em>But that exercise faces an immediate challenge: Because <em>Chevron</em> depends on a judicially implied, rather than a legislatively expressed, delegation of interpretive authority to an executive agency, Part II–A, <em>supra</em>, when should the fiction apply and when not?  <em>Mead</em> fashioned a multifactor test for judges to use.  533 U.&nbsp;S., at &nbsp;229–231.  But that test has proved as indeterminate in application as it was contrived in origin.  Perhaps for these reasons, perhaps for others, this Court has sometimes<em> </em>applied <em>Mead</em> and often ignored it.  See <em>Brand X</em>, 545 U.&nbsp;S., at 1014, n.&nbsp;8 (Scalia, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Things do not improve as we move up the <em>Chevron </em>ladder.  At “step one,” a judge must defer to an executive official’s interpretation when the statute at hand is “ambiguous.”  But even today, <em>Chevron</em>’s principal beneficiary—the federal government—still cannot say when a statute is sufficiently ambiguous to trigger deference.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Tr. of Oral Arg. in <em>American Hospital Assn.</em> v. <em>Becerra</em>, O. T. 2021, No.&nbsp;20–1114, pp.&nbsp;71–72.  Perhaps thanks to this particular confusion, the search for ambiguity has devolved into a sort of Snark hunt: Some judges claim to spot it almost everywhere, while other equally fine judges claim never<em> </em>to have seen it.  Compare L. Silberman, <em>Chevron</em>—The Intersection of Law &amp; Policy, 58 Geo. Wash. L.&nbsp;Rev. 821, 826 (1990), with R. Kethledge, Ambiguities and Agency Cases: Reflections After (Almost) Ten Years on the Bench, 70 Vand. L.&nbsp;Rev. En Banc 315, 323 (2017).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Nor do courts agree when it comes to “step two.”  There, a judge must assess whether an executive agency’s interpretation of an ambiguous statute is “reasonable.”  But what does that inquiry demand?  Some courts engage in a comparatively searching review; others almost reflexively defer to an agency’s views.  Here again, courts have pursued “wildly different” approaches and reached wildly different conclusions in similar cases.  See B. Kavanaugh, Fixing Statutory Interpretation, 129 Harv. L. Rev. 2118, 2152 (2016) (Kavanaugh).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Today’s cases exemplify some of these problems.  We have before us two circuit decisions, three opinions, and at least as many interpretive options on the <em>Chevron</em> menu.  On the one hand, we have the D. C. Circuit majority, which deemed the Magnuson-Stevens Act “ambiguous” and upheld the &nbsp;agency’s regulation as “&nbsp;‘permissible.’&nbsp;”  45 F.&nbsp;4th 359, 365 (2022).  On the other hand, we have the D. C. Circuit dissent, which argues the statute is “unambiguou[s]” and that it plainly forecloses the agency’s new rule.  <em>Id.</em>, at 372 (opinion of Walker, J.).  And on yet a third hand, we have the First Circuit, which claimed to have identified “clear textual support” for the regulation, yet refused to say whether it would “classify [its] conclusion as a product of <em>Chevron</em> step one or step two.”  62 F.&nbsp;4th 621, 631, 634 (2023).  As these cases illustrate, <em>Chevron</em> has turned statutory interpretation into a game of bingo under blindfold, with parties guessing at how many boxes there are and which one their case might ultimately fall in.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Turn now from workability to reliance.  Far from engendering reliance interests, the whole point of <em>Chevron</em> deference is to upset them.  Under <em>Chevron</em>, executive officials can replace one “reasonable” interpretation with another at any time, all without any change in the law itself.  The result:  Affected individuals “can never be sure of their legal rights and duties.”  <em>Buffington</em>, 598 U.&nbsp;S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> How bad is the problem?  Take just one example.  <em>Brand X</em> concerned a law regulating broadband internet services.  There, the Court upheld an agency rule adopted by the administration of President George W. Bush because it was premised on a “reasonable” interpretation of the statute.  Later, President Barack Obama’s administration rescinded the rule and replaced it with another.  Later still, during President Donald J. Trump’s administration, officials replaced that rule with a different one, all before President Joseph R. Biden, Jr.’s administration declared its intention to reverse course for yet a fourth time.  See Safeguarding and Securing the Open Internet, <a aria-label=\"88 FR 76048\" href=\"/rio/citation/88_FR_76048\">88 Fed. Reg. 76048</a> (2023); <em>Brand X</em>, 545 U.&nbsp;S., at 981–982.  Each time, the government claimed its new rule was just as “reasonable” as the last.  Rather than promoting reliance by fixing the meaning of &nbsp;the law, <em>Chevron</em> deference engenders constant uncertainty and convulsive change even when the statute at issue itself remains unchanged.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Nor are these antireliance harms distributed equally.  Sophisticated entities and their lawyers may be able to keep pace with rule changes affecting their rights and responsibilities.  They may be able to lobby for new “&nbsp;‘reasonable’&nbsp;” agency interpretations and even capture the agencies that issue them.  <em>Buffington</em>, 598 U.&nbsp;S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 8, 13).  But ordinary people can do none of those things.  They are the ones who suffer the worst kind of regulatory whiplash <em>Chevron</em> invites.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Consider a couple of examples.  Thomas Buffington, a veteran of the U.&nbsp;S. Air Force, was injured in the line of duty.  For a time after he left the Air Force, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) paid disability benefits due him by law.  But later the government called on Mr. Buffington to reenter active service.  During that period, everyone agreed, the VA could (as it did) suspend his disability payments.  After he left active service for a second time, however, the VA turned his patriotism against him.  By law, Congress permitted the VA to suspend disability pay only “for any period for which [a servicemember] receives active service pay.”  <a aria-label=\"38 USC 5304 c\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/5304#c\">38 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §5304(c)</a>.  But the VA had adopted a self-serving regulation requiring veterans to file a form asking for the resumption of their disability pay after a second (or subsequent) stint in active service.  <a aria-label=\"38 CFR\" href=\"/cfr/text/38\">38</a> CFR §3.654(b)(2) (2021).  Unaware of the regulation, Mr. Buffington failed to reapply immediately.  When he finally figured out what had happened and reapplied, the VA agreed to resume payments going forward but refused to give Mr. Buffington all of the past disability payments it had withheld.  <em>Buffington</em>, 598 U.&nbsp;S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 1–4).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Mr. Buffington challenged the agency’s action as inconsistent with Congress’s direction that the VA may suspend disability payments only for those periods when a veteran &nbsp;returns to active service.  But armed with <em>Chevron</em>, the agency defeated Mr. Buffington’s claim.  Maybe the self-serving regulation the VA cited as justification for its action was not premised on the best reading of the law, courts said, but it represented a “&nbsp;‘permissible’&nbsp;” one.  598 U.&nbsp;S., at ___ (slip op., at 7).  In that way, the Executive Branch was able to evade Congress’s promises to someone who took the field repeatedly in the Nation’s defense.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"><em> </em>In another case, one which I heard as a court of appeals judge, <em>De Niz Robles </em>v.<em> Lynch</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/803_F.3d_1165\">803 F.&nbsp;3d 1165</a> (CA10 2015), the Board of Immigration Appeals invoked <em>Chevron</em> to overrule a judicial precedent on which many immigrants had relied, see <em>In&nbsp;re Briones</em>, 24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 355, 370 (BIA 2007) (purporting to overrule <em>Padilla–Caldera </em>v.<em> Gonzales</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/426_F.3d_1294\">426 F.&nbsp;3d 1294</a> (CA10 2005)).  The agency then sought to apply its new interpretation retroactively to punish those immigrants—including Alfonzo De Niz Robles, who had relied on that judicial precedent as authority to remain in this country with his U.&nbsp;S. wife and four children.  See <a aria-label=\"803 F.3d 1168\" href=\"/rio/citation/803_F.3d_1168\">803 F.&nbsp;3d, at 1168</a>–1169.<em> </em>Our court ruled that this retrospective application of the BIA’s new interpretation of the law violated Mr. De Niz Robles’s due process rights.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1172.  But as a lower court, we could treat only the symptom, not the disease.  So <em>Chevron</em> permitted the agency going forward to overrule a judicial decision about the best reading of the law with its own different “reasonable” one and in that way deny relief to countless future immigrants.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Those are just two stories among so many that federal judges could tell (and have told) about what <em>Chevron</em> deference has meant for ordinary people interacting with the federal government.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Lambert</em> v. <em>Saul</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/980_F.3d_1266\">980 F.&nbsp;3d 1266</a>, 1268–1276 (CA9 2020); <em>Valent</em> v. <em>Commissioner</em> <em>of Social Security</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/918_F.3d_516\">918 F.&nbsp;3d 516</a>, 525–527 (CA6 2019) (Kethledge, J., dissenting); <em>Gonzalez</em> v. <em>United States Atty. Gen.</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/820_F.3d_399\">820 F.&nbsp;3d 399</a>, 402–405 (CA11 2016) (<em>per&nbsp;curiam</em>).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> What does the federal government have to say about this?  &nbsp;It acknowledges that <em>Chevron</em> sits as a heavy weight on the scale in favor of the government, “oppositional” to many “categories of individuals.”  Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 22–1219, p.&nbsp;133 (Relentless Tr.).  But, according to the government, <em>Chevron</em> deference is too important an innovation to undo.  In its brief reign, the government says, it has become a “fundamenta[l] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ground rul[e] for how all three branches of the government are operating together.”  Relentless Tr. 102.  But, in truth, the Constitution, the APA, and our longstanding precedents set those ground rules some time ago.  And under them, agencies cannot invoke a judge-made fiction to unsettle our Nation’s promise to individuals that they are entitled to make their arguments about the law’s demands on them in a fair hearing, one in which they stand on equal footing with the government before an independent judge.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">C</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> How could a Court, guided for 200 years by Chief Justice Marshall’s example, come to embrace a counter-<em>Marbury</em> revolution, one at war with the APA, time honored precedents, and so much surrounding law?  To answer these questions, turn to Lesson 3 and witness the temptation to endow a stray passage in a judicial decision with extraordinary authority.  Call it “power quoting.”</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Chevron </em>was an unlikely place for a revolution to begin.  The case concerned the Clean Air Act’s requirement that States regulate “stationary sources” of air pollution in their borders.  See <a aria-label=\"42 USC 7401\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7401\">42&nbsp;U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;§7401</a> <em>et&nbsp;seq</em>.  At the time, it was an open question whether entire industrial plants or their constituent polluting parts counted as “stationary sources.”  The Environmental Protection Agency had defined entire plants as sources, an approach that allowed companies to replace individual plant parts without automatically triggering the permitting requirements that apply to new sources.  <em>Chevron</em>, 467&nbsp;U.&nbsp;S., at 840.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; This Court upheld the EPA’s definition as consistent with the governing statute.  <em>Id</em>., at 866.  The decision, issued by a bare quorum of the Court, without concurrence or dissent, purported to apply “well-settled principles.”  <em>Id</em>., at 845.  “If a court, employing traditional tools of statutory construction, ascertains that Congress had an intention on the precise question at issue,” <em>Chevron</em> provided, then “that intention is the law and must be given effect.”  <em>Id</em>., at 843, n.&nbsp;9.  Many of the cases <em>Chevron</em> cited to support its judgment stood for the traditional proposition that courts afford respectful consideration, not deference, to executive interpretations of the law.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Burnet</em>, 285 U.&nbsp;S., at 16; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Moore</em>, <a aria-label=\"95 U. S. 760\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/95/760\">95 U.&nbsp;S. 760</a>, 763 (1878).  And the decision’s sole citation to legal scholarship was to Roscoe Pound, who long championed <em>de novo</em> judicial review.  467 U.&nbsp;S., at 843, n.&nbsp;10; see R. Pound, The Place of the Judiciary in a Democratic Polity, 27 A.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;A. J. 133, 136–137 (1941).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> At the same time, of course, the opinion contained bits and pieces that spoke differently.  The decision also said that, “if [a] statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to [a] specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency’s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.”  467&nbsp;U.&nbsp;S., at 843.  But it seems the government didn’t advance this formulation in its brief, so there was no adversarial engagement on it.  T. Merrill, The Story of <em>Chevron</em>: The Making of an Accidental Landmark, 66 Admin. L.&nbsp;Rev. 253, 268 (2014) (Merrill).  As we have seen, too, the Court did not pause to consider (or even mention) the APA.  See Part II–A, <em>supra.</em>  It did not discuss contrary precedents issued by the Court since the founding, let alone purport to overrule any of them.  See Part II–B–1, <em>supra.</em>  Nor did the Court seek to address how its novel rule of deference might be squared with so much surrounding law.  See Part II–B–2, <em>supra</em>.  As even its defenders have acknowledged, “<em>Chevron</em> barely bothered to justify its rule of deference, and the few brief passages on this matter pointed in disparate &nbsp;directions.”  Kagan 212–213.  “[T]he quality of the reasoning,” they acknowledge, “was not high,” C. Sunstein, <em>Chevron </em>as Law, 107 Geo. L.&nbsp;J. 1613, 1669 (2019).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> If <em>Chevron </em>meant to usher in a revolution in how judges interpret laws, no one appears to have realized it at the time.  <em>Chevron</em>’s author, Justice Stevens, characterized the decision as a “simpl[e] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. restatement of existing law, nothing more or less.”  Merrill 255, 275.  In the “19 argued cases” in the following Term “that presented some kind of question about whether the Court should defer to an agency interpretation of statutory law,” this Court cited <em>Chevron</em> just once.  Merrill 276.  By some accounts, the decision seemed “destined to obscurity.”  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> It was only three years later when Justice Scalia wrote a concurrence that a revolution began to take shape.  <em>Buffington</em>, 598 U.&nbsp;S., at ___ (slip op., at 8).  There, he argued for a new rule requiring courts to defer to executive agency interpretations of the law whenever a “&nbsp;‘statute is silent or ambiguous.’&nbsp;”  <em>NLRB</em> v. <em>Food &amp; Commercial Workers</em>, <a aria-label=\"484 U. S. 112\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/484/112\">484&nbsp;U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;112</a>, 133–134 (1987) (opinion of Scalia, J.).  Eventually, a majority of the Court followed his lead.  <em>Buffington</em>, 598 U.&nbsp;S., at ___ (slip op., at 8).  But from the start, Justice Scalia made no secret about the scope of his ambitions.  See Judicial Deference to Administrative Interpretations of Law, 1989 Duke L. J. 511, 521 (1989) (Scalia).  The rule he advocated for represented such a sharp break from prior practice, he explained, that many judges of his day didn’t yet “understand” the “old criteria” were “no longer relevant.”  <em>Ibid</em>.  Still, he said, overthrowing the past was worth it because a new deferential rule would be “easier to follow.”  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Events proved otherwise.  As the years wore on and the Court’s new and aggressive reading of <em>Chevron</em> gradually exposed itself as unworkable, unfair, and at odds with our separation of powers, Justice Scalia could have doubled down on the project.  But he didn’t.  He appreciated that <em>stare decisis</em> is not a rule of “if I thought it yesterday, I must think it tomorrow.”  And rather than cling to the pride of personal precedent, the Justice began to express doubts over the very project that he had worked to build.  See <em>Perez</em> v. <em>Mortgage Bankers Assn.</em>, <a aria-label=\"575 U. S. 92\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/575/92\">575 U.&nbsp;S. 92</a>, 109–110 (2015) (opinion concurring in judgment); cf. <em>Decker</em> v. <em>Northwest Environmental Defense Center</em>, <a aria-label=\"568 U. S. 597\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/568/597\">568 U.&nbsp;S. 597</a>, 617–618, 621 (2013) (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).  If <em>Chevron</em>’s ascent is a testament to the Justice’s ingenuity, its demise is an even greater tribute to his humility.<a aria-label=\"reference 6 of Gorsuch Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_6-6\" id=\"CONCUR_6-6ref\"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Justice Scalia was not alone in his reconsideration.  After years spent laboring under <em>Chevron</em>, trying to make sense of it and make it work, Member after Member of this Court came to question the project.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Pereira</em> v. <em>Sessions</em>, <a aria-label=\"585 U. S. 198\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/585/198\">585 U.&nbsp;S. 198</a>, 219–221 (2018) (Kennedy, J., concurring); <em>Michigan</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, <a aria-label=\"576 U. S. 743\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/576/743\">576 U.&nbsp;S. 743</a>, 760–764 (2015) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas</span>, J., concurring); <em>Kisor</em>, 588 U.&nbsp;S., at 591 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Roberts</span>, C. J., concurring in part); <em>Gutierrez-Brizuela</em>, <a aria-label=\"834 F.3d 1153\" href=\"/rio/citation/834_F.3d_1153\">834 F.&nbsp;3d, at 1153</a>; <em>Buffington</em>, 598 U.&nbsp;S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 14–15); Kavanaugh 2150–2154.  Ultimately, the Court gave up.  Despite repeated invitations, it has not applied <em>Chevron </em>deference since 2016.  Relentless Tr. 81; App. to Brief for Respondents in No. 22–1219, p.&nbsp;68a.  So an experiment that began only in the mid-1980s effectively ended eight years ago.  Along the way, an unusually large number of federal appellate judges<em> </em>voiced their own thoughtful and extensive &nbsp;criticisms of <em>Chevron</em>.  <em>Buffington</em>, 598 U.&nbsp;S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 14–15) (collecting examples).  A number of state courts did, too, refusing to import <em>Chevron</em> deference into their own administrative law jurisprudence.  See 598 U.&nbsp;S., at ___ (slip op., at 15).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Even if all that and everything else laid out above is true, the government suggests we should retain <em>Chevron</em> deference because judges simply cannot live without it; some statutes are just too “technical” for courts to interpret “intelligently.”  <em>Post</em>, at 9, 32 (dissenting opinion).  But that objection is no answer to <em>Chevron</em>’s inconsistency with Congress’s directions in the APA, so much surrounding law, or the challenges its multistep regime have posed in practice.  Nor does history counsel such defeatism.  Surely, it would be a mistake to suggest our predecessors before <em>Chevron</em>’s rise in the mid-1980s were unable to make their way intelligently through technical statutory disputes.  Following their lead, over the past eight years this Court has managed to resolve even highly complex cases without <em>Chevron</em> deference, and done so even when the government sought deference.  Nor, as far as I am aware, did any Member of the Court suggest <em>Chevron </em>deference was necessary to an intelligent resolution of any of those matters.<a aria-label=\"reference 7 of Gorsuch Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_6-7\" id=\"CONCUR_6-7ref\"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup></a>  If anything, by affording <em>Chevron</em> deference a period of repose before addressing whether it should be retained, the Court has enabled its Members to test the propriety of that precedent and reflect more deeply on how well it fits into the broader architecture of our law.  Others may see things differently, see <em>post</em>, at 26–27 (dissenting opinion), but the caution the &nbsp;Court has exhibited before overruling <em>Chevron</em> may illustrate one of the reasons why the current Court has been slower to overrule precedents than some of its predecessors, see Part I–C, <em>supra</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> None of this, of course, discharges any Member of this Court from the task of deciding for himself or herself today whether <em>Chevron</em> deference itself warrants deference.  But when so many past and current judicial colleagues in this Court and across the country tell us our doctrine is misguided, and when we ourselves managed without <em>Chevron </em>for centuries and manage to do so today, the humility at the core of <em>stare decisis</em> compels us to pause and reflect carefully on the wisdom embodied in that experience.  And, in the end, to my mind the lessons of experience counsel wisely against continued reliance on <em>Chevron</em>’s stray and unconsidered digression.  This Court’s opinions fill over 500 volumes, and perhaps “some printed judicial word may be found to support almost any plausible proposition.”  R. Jackson, Decisional Law and Stare Decisis, 30 A.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;A. J. 334 (1944).  It is not for us to pick and choose passages we happen to like and demand total obedience to them in perpetuity.  That would turn <em>stare decisis</em> from a doctrine of humility into a tool for judicial opportunism.  <em>Brown</em>,<em> </em>596 U.&nbsp;S., at 141.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">III</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Proper respect for precedent helps “keep the scale of justice even and steady,” by reinforcing decisional rules consistent with the law upon which all can rely.  1 Blackstone 69.  But that respect does not require, nor does it readily tolerate, a steadfast refusal to correct mistakes.  As early as 1810, this Court had already overruled one of its cases.  See <em>Hudson</em> v. <em>Guestier</em>, 6 Cranch 281, 284 (overruling <em>Rose</em> v. <em>Himely</em>, 4 Cranch 241 (1808)).  In recent years, the Court may have overruled precedents less frequently than it did during the Warren and Burger Courts.  See Part I–C, <em>supra</em>.  &nbsp;But the job of reconsidering past decisions remains one every Member of this Court faces from time to time.<a aria-label=\"reference 8 of Gorsuch Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_6-8\" id=\"CONCUR_6-8ref\"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Justice William O. Douglas served longer on this Court than any other person in the Nation’s history.  During his tenure, he observed how a new colleague might be inclined initially to “revere” every word written in an opinion issued before he arrived.  W. Douglas, Stare Decisis, 49 Colum. L. Rev. 735, 736 (1949).  But, over time, Justice Douglas reflected, his new colleague would “remembe[r] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that it is the Constitution which he swore to support and defend, not the gloss which his predecessors may have put on it.”  <em>Ibid.</em>  And “[s]o he [would] com[e] to formulate his own views, rejecting some earlier ones as false and embracing others.”  <em>Ibid. </em> This process of reexamination, Justice Douglas explained, is a “necessary consequence of our system” in which each judge takes an oath—both “personal” and binding—to discern the law’s meaning for himself and apply it faithfully in the cases that come before him.  <em>Id.</em>, at 736–737.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Justice Douglas saw, too, how appeals to precedent could be overstated and sometimes even overwrought.  Judges, he reflected, would sometimes first issue “new and startling decision[s],” and then later spin around and “acquire an acute conservatism” in their aggressive defense of “their &nbsp;new <em>status quo</em>.”  <em>Id</em>., at 737.  In that way, even the most novel and unlikely decisions became “coveted anchorage[s],” defended heatedly, if ironically, under the banner of “<em>stare decisis</em>.”  <em>Ibid.</em>; see also <em>Edwards</em> v. <em>Vannoy</em>, <a aria-label=\"593 U. S. 255\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/593/255\">593 U.&nbsp;S. 255</a>, 294, n.&nbsp;7 (2021) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Gorsuch, J.</span>, concurring).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"><em> </em>That is <em>Chevron</em>’s story: A revolution masquerading as the status quo.  And the defense of it follows the same course Justice Douglas described.  Though our dissenting colleagues have not hesitated to question other precedents in the past, they today manifest what Justice Douglas called an “acute conservatism” for <em>Chevron</em>’s “startling” development, insisting that if this “coveted anchorage” is abandoned the heavens will fall.  But the Nation managed to live with busy executive agencies of all sorts long before the <em>Chevron</em> revolution began to take shape in the mid-1980s.  And all today’s decision means is that, going forward, federal courts will do exactly as this Court has since 2016, exactly as it did before the mid-1980s, and exactly as it had done since the founding: resolve cases and controversies without any systemic bias in the government’s favor.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Proper respect for precedent does not begin to suggest otherwise.  Instead, it counsels respect for the written law, adherence to consistent teachings over aberrations, and resistance to the temptation of treating our own stray remarks as if they were statutes.  And each of those lessons points toward the same conclusion today: <em>Chevron</em> deference is inconsistent with the directions Congress gave us in the APA.  It represents a grave anomaly when viewed against the sweep of historic judicial practice.  The decision undermines core rule-of-law values ranging from the promise of fair notice to the promise of a fair hearing.  Even on its own terms, it has proved unworkable and operated to undermine rather than advance reliance interests, often to the detriment of ordinary Americans.  And from the start, the whole project has relied on the overaggressive use of snippets and stray remarks from an opinion that carried &nbsp;mixed messages.  <em>Stare decisis</em>’s true lesson today is not that we are bound to respect <em>Chevron</em>’s “startling development,” but bound to inter it.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<h3 class=\"fnheader\">Notes</h3>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"CONCUR_6-1\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Gorsuch Concurrence at reference 1\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#CONCUR_6-1ref\">1</a> &nbsp;For relevant databases of decisions, see Congressional Research Service, Table of Supreme Court Decisions Overruled by Subsequent Decisions, Constitution Annotated, https://constitution.congress.gov/resources/&nbsp;decisions-overruled/; see also H.

Many of the presumptions and interpretive canons the dissent cites—including lenity, <em>contra proferentem</em>, and others besides—“&nbsp;‘embod[y] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. legal doctrine[s] centuries older than our Republic.’&nbsp;”  <em>Opati</em> v. <em>Republic of Sudan</em>, <a aria-label=\"590 U. S. 418\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/590/418\">590 U.&nbsp;S. 418</a>, 425 (2020).  <em>Chevron</em> deference can make no such boast.  Many of the presumptions and canons the dissent cites also serve the Constitution, protecting the lines of authority it draws.  Take just two examples: The federalism canon tells courts to presume federal statutes do not preempt state laws because of the sovereignty States enjoy under the Constitution.  <em>Bond </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"572 U. S. 844\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/572/844\">572 U.&nbsp;S. 844</a>, 858 (2014).  The presumption against retroactivity serves as guardian of the Constitution’s promise of due process and its ban on <em>ex post facto</em> laws, <em>Landgraf</em> v. <em>USI Film Products</em>, <a aria-label=\"511 U. S. 244\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/511/244\">511 U.&nbsp;S. 244</a>, 265 (1994).  Once more, however, <em>Chevron</em> deference can make no similar claim.  Rather than serve the Constitution’s usual rule that litigants are entitled to have an independent judge interpret disputed legal terms, <em>Chevron</em> deference works to undermine that promise.  As explored above, too, <em>Chevron</em> deference sits in tension with many traditional legal presumptions and interpretive principles, representing nearly the <em>inverse</em> of the rules of lenity, <em>nemo iudex</em>, and <em>contra proferentem</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"CONCUR_6-6\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Gorsuch Concurrence at reference 6\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#CONCUR_6-6ref\">6</a>  &nbsp;It should be recalled that, when Justice Scalia launched the <em>Chevron</em> revolution, there were many judges who “abhor[red] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ‘plain meaning’&nbsp;” and preferred instead to elevate “legislative history” and their own curated accounts of a law’s “purpose[s]” over enacted statutory text.  Scalia 515, 521.  <em>Chevron</em>, he predicted, would provide a new guardrail against that practice.  Scalia 515, 521<em>.  </em>As the Justice’s later writings show, he had the right diagnosis, just the wrong cure.  The answer for judges eliding statutory terms is not deference to agencies that may seek to do the same, but a demand that all return to a more faithful adherence to the written law.  That was, of course, another project Justice Scalia championed.  And as we like to say, “we’re all textualists now.”</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"CONCUR_6-7\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Gorsuch Concurrence at reference 7\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#CONCUR_6-7ref\">7</a> &nbsp;See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Becerra</em> v. <em>Empire Health Foundation, for Valley Hospital Medical Center</em>, <a aria-label=\"597 U.

Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"467 U.S. 837\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/467/837\">467 U.&nbsp;S. 837 (1984)</a>, has served as a cornerstone of administrative law, allocating responsibility for statutory construction between courts and agencies.  Under <em>Chevron</em>, a court uses all its normal interpretive tools to determine whether Congress has spoken to an issue.  If the court finds Congress has done so, that is the end of the matter; the agency’s views make no difference.  But if the court finds, at the end of its interpretive work, that &nbsp;Congress has left an ambiguity or gap, then a choice must be made.  Who should give content to a statute when Congress’s instructions have run out?  Should it be a court?  Or should it be the agency Congress has charged with administering the statute?  The answer <em>Chevron </em>gives is that it should usually be the agency, within the bounds of reasonableness.  That rule has formed the backdrop against which Congress, courts, and agencies—as well as regulated parties and the public—all have operated for decades.  It has been applied in thousands of judicial decisions.  It has become part of the warp and woof of modern government, supporting regulatory efforts of all kinds—to name a few, keeping air and water clean, food and drugs safe, and financial markets honest.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> And the rule is right.  This Court has long understood <em>Chevron </em>deference to reflect what Congress would want, and so to be rooted in a presumption of legislative intent.  Congress knows that it does not—in fact cannot—write perfectly complete regulatory statutes.  It knows that those statutes will inevitably contain ambiguities that some other actor will have to resolve, and gaps that some other actor will have to fill.  And it would usually prefer that actor to be the responsible agency, not a court.  Some interpretive issues arising in the regulatory context involve scientific or technical subject matter.  Agencies have expertise in those areas; courts do not.  Some demand a detailed understanding of complex and interdependent regulatory programs.  Agencies know those programs inside-out; again, courts do not.  And some present policy choices, including trade-offs between competing goods.  Agencies report to a President, who in turn answers to the public for his policy calls; courts have no such accountability and no proper basis for making policy.  And of course Congress has conferred on that expert, experienced, and politically accountable agency the authority to administer—to make rules about and otherwise implement—the statute giving rise to the ambiguity or &nbsp;gap.  Put all that together and deference to the agency is the almost obvious choice, based on an implicit congressional delegation of interpretive authority.  We defer, the Court has explained, “because of a presumption that Congress” would have “desired the agency (rather than the courts)” to exercise “whatever degree of discretion” the statute allows.  <em>Smiley</em> v. <em>Citibank (South Dakota), N.&nbsp;A.</em>, <a aria-label=\"517 U. S. 735\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/517/735\">517 U.&nbsp;S. 735</a>, 740–741 (1996).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Today, the Court flips the script: It is now “the courts (rather than the agency)” that will wield power when Congress has left an area of interpretive discretion.  A rule of judicial humility gives way to a rule of judicial hubris.  In recent years, this Court has too often taken for itself decision-making authority Congress assigned to agencies.  The Court has substituted its own judgment on workplace health for that of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration; its own judgment on climate change for that of the Environmental Protection Agency; and its own judgment on student loans for that of the Department of Education.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>National Federation of Independent Business </em>v. <em>OSHA</em>, <a aria-label=\"595 U.S. 109\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/595/109\">595 U.&nbsp;S. 109 (2022)</a>; <em>West Virginia</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, <a aria-label=\"597 U.S. 697\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/597/697\">597 U.&nbsp;S. 697 (2022)</a>; <em>Biden</em> v. <em>Nebraska</em>, <a aria-label=\"600 U.S. 477\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/600/477\">600 U.&nbsp;S. 477 (2023)</a>.  But evidently that was, for this Court, all too piecemeal.  In one fell swoop, the majority today gives itself exclusive power over every open issue—no matter how expertise-driven or policy-laden—involving the meaning of regulatory law.  As if it did not have enough on its plate, the majority turns itself into the country’s administrative czar.  It defends that move as one (suddenly) required by the (nearly 80-year-old) Administrative Procedure Act.  But the Act makes no such demand.  Today’s decision is not one Congress directed.  It is entirely the majority’s choice.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> And the majority cannot destroy one doctrine of judicial humility without making a laughing-stock of a second.  (If opinions had titles, a good candidate for today’s would be Hubris Squared.)  <em>Stare decisis </em>is, among other things, a &nbsp;way to remind judges that wisdom often lies in what prior judges have done.  It is a brake on the urge to convert “every new judge’s opinion” into a new legal rule or regime.  <em>Dobbs</em> v. <em>Jackson Women’s Health Organization</em>, <a aria-label=\"597 U. S. 215\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/597/215\">597 U.&nbsp;S. 215</a>, 388 (2022) (joint opinion of Breyer, <span class=\"smallcaps\">Sotomayor</span>, and <span class=\"smallcaps\">Kagan</span>, JJ., dissenting) (quoting 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 69 (7th ed. 1775)).  <em>Chevron </em>is entrenched precedent, entitled to the protection of <em>stare decisis</em>, as even the majority acknowledges.  In fact, <em>Chevron</em> is entitled to the supercharged version of that doctrine because Congress could always overrule the decision, and because so many governmental and private actors have relied on it for so long.  Because that is so, the majority needs a “particularly special justification” for its action.  <em>Kisor</em> v. <em>Wilkie</em>, <a aria-label=\"588 U. S. 558\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/588/558\">588 U.&nbsp;S. 558</a>, 588 (2019) (opinion of the Court).  But the majority has nothing that would qualify.  It barely tries to advance the usual factors this Court invokes for overruling precedent.  Its justification comes down, in the end, to this: Courts must have more say over regulation—over the provision of health care, the protection of the environment, the safety of consumer products, the efficacy of transportation systems, and so on.  A longstanding precedent at the crux of administrative governance thus falls victim to a bald assertion of judicial authority.  The majority disdains restraint, and grasps for power.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">I</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Begin with the problem that gave rise to <em>Chevron </em>(and also to its older precursors): The regulatory statutes Congress passes often contain ambiguities and gaps.  Sometimes they are intentional.  Perhaps Congress “consciously desired” the administering agency to fill in aspects of the legislative scheme, believing that regulatory experts would be “in a better position” than legislators to do so.  <em>Chevron</em>, 467 U.&nbsp;S., at 865.  Or “perhaps Congress was unable to forge a coalition on either side” of a question, and the contending &nbsp;parties “decided to take their chances with” the agency’s resolution.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Sometimes, though, the gaps or ambiguities are what might be thought of as predictable accidents.  They may be the result of sloppy drafting, a not infrequent legislative occurrence.  Or they may arise from the well-known limits of language or foresight.  Accord, <em>ante</em>, at 7, 22.  “The subject matter” of a statutory provision may be too “specialized and varying” to “capture in its every detail.”  <em>Kisor</em>, 588 U.&nbsp;S., at 566 (plurality opinion).  Or the provision may give rise, years or decades down the road, to an issue the enacting Congress could not have anticipated.  Whichever the case—whatever the reason—the result is to create uncertainty about some aspect of a provision’s meaning.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Consider a few examples from the caselaw.  They will help show what a typical <em>Chevron </em>question looks like—or really, what a typical <em>Chevron </em>question <em>is</em>.  Because when choosing whether to send some class of questions mainly to a court, or mainly to an agency, abstract analysis can only go so far; indeed, it may obscure what matters most.  So I begin with the concrete:</p>\n<p class=\"blpara jy-both\">Under the Public Health Service Act, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates “biological product[s],” including “protein[s].”  <a aria-label=\"42 USC 262 i 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/262#i_1\">42 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §262(i)(1)</a>.  When does an alpha amino acid polymer qualify as such a “protein”?  Must it have a specific, defined sequence of amino acids?  See <em>Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.</em> v. <em>FDA</em>, 514 F. Supp. 3d 66, 79–80, 93–106 (DC 2020).</p>\n<p class=\"blpara jy-both\">Under the Endangered Species Act, the Fish and Wildlife Service must designate endangered “vertebrate fish or wildlife” species, including “distinct population segment[s]” of those species.  <a aria-label=\"16 USC 1532 16\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/1532#16\">16 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §1532(16)</a>; see §1533.  What makes one population segment “distinct” from another?  Must the Service treat the Washington State population of western gray squirrels as “distinct”&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"blpara jy-both indent_l-432\">&nbsp;because it is geographically separated from other western gray squirrels?  Or can the Service take into account that the genetic makeup of the Washington population does not differ markedly from the rest?  See <em>Northwest Ecosystem Alliance</em> v. <em>United States Fish and Wildlife Serv.</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/475_F.3d_1136\">475 F. 3d 1136</a>, 1140–1145, 1149 (CA9 2007).</p>\n<p class=\"blpara jy-both\">Under the Medicare program, reimbursements to hospitals are adjusted to reflect “differences in hospital wage levels” across “geographic area[s].”  <a aria-label=\"42 USC 1395ww d 3 E i\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1395ww#d_3_E_i\">42 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §1395ww(d)(3)(E)(i)</a>.  How should the Department of Health and Human Services measure a “geographic area”?  By city?  By county?  By metropolitan area?  See <em>Bellevue Hospital Center</em> v. <em>Leavitt</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/443_F.3d_163\">443 F. 3d 163</a>, 174–176 (CA2 2006).</p>\n<p class=\"blpara jy-both\">Congress directed the Department of the Interior and the Federal Aviation Administration to reduce noise from aircraft flying over Grand Canyon National Park—specifically, to “provide for substantial restoration of the natural quiet.”  §3(b)(1), <a href=\"/rio/citation/101_Stat._676\">101 Stat. 676</a>; see §3(b)(2).  How much noise is consistent with “the natural quiet”?  And how much of the park, for how many hours a day, must be that quiet for the “substantial restoration” requirement to be met?  See <em>Grand Canyon Air Tour Coalition</em> v. <em>FAA</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/154_F.3d_455\">154 F. 3d 455</a>, 466–467, 474–475 (CADC 1998).</p>\n<p class=\"blpara jy-both\">Or take <em>Chevron</em> itself.  In amendments to the Clean Air Act, Congress told States to require permits for modifying or constructing “stationary sources” of air pollution.  <a aria-label=\"42 USC 7502 c 5\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7502#c_5\">42 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §7502(c)(5)</a>.  Does the term “stationary source[&nbsp;]” refer to each pollution-emitting piece of equipment within a plant?  Or does it refer to the entire plant, and thus allow escape from the permitting requirement when increased emissions from one piece of equipment are offset by reductions from another?  See 467 U.&nbsp;S., at 857, 859.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp;In each case, a statutory phrase has more than one reasonable reading.  And Congress has not chosen among them: It has not, in any real-world sense, “fixed” the “single, best meaning” at “the time of enactment” (to use the majority’s phrase).  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  A question thus arises: Who decides which of the possible readings should govern?</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> This Court has long thought that the choice should usually fall to agencies, with courts broadly deferring to their judgments.  For the last 40 years, that doctrine has gone by the name of <em>Chevron </em>deference, after the 1984 decision that formalized and canonized it.  In <em>Chevron</em>, the Court set out a simple two-part framework for reviewing an agency’s interpretation of a statute that it administers.  First, the reviewing court must determine whether Congress has “directly spoken to the precise question at issue.”  467 U.&nbsp;S., at 842.  That inquiry is rigorous: A court must exhaust all the “traditional tools of statutory construction” to divine statutory meaning.  <em>Id.</em>, at 843, n.&nbsp;9.  And when it can find that meaning—a “single right answer”—that is “the end of the matter”: The court cannot defer because it “must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.”  <em>Kisor</em>, 588 U.&nbsp;S., at 575 (opinion of the Court); <em>Chevron</em>, 467 U.&nbsp;S., at 842–843.  But if the court, after using its whole legal toolkit, concludes that “the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue” in dispute—for any of the not-uncommon reasons discussed above—then the court must cede the primary interpretive role.  <em>Ibid.</em>; see <em>supra</em>, at 4–5.  At that second step, the court asks only whether the agency construction is within the sphere of “reasonable” readings.  <em>Chevron</em>, 467 U.&nbsp;S., at 844.  If it is, the agency’s interpretation of the statute that it every day implements will control.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> That rule, the Court has long explained, rests on a presumption about legislative intent—about what Congress wants when a statute it has charged an agency with implementing contains an ambiguity or a gap.  See <em>id.</em>, at 843–&nbsp;845; <em>Smiley</em>, 517 U.&nbsp;S., at 740–741.  An enacting Congress, as noted above, knows those uncertainties will arise, even if it does not know what they will turn out to be.  See <em>supra</em>, at 4–5.  And every once in a while, Congress provides an explicit instruction for dealing with that contingency—assigning primary responsibility to the courts, or else to an agency.  But much more often, Congress does not say.  Thus arises the need for a presumption—really, a default rule—for what should happen in that event.  Does a statutory silence or ambiguity then go to a court for resolution?  Or to an agency?  This Court has long thought Congress would choose an agency, with courts serving only as a backstop to make sure the agency makes a reasonable choice among the possible readings.  Or said otherwise, Congress would select the agency it has put in control of a regulatory scheme to exercise the “degree of discretion” that the statute’s lack of clarity or completeness allows.  <em>Smiley</em>,<em> </em>517 U.&nbsp;S., at 741.  Of course, Congress can always refute that presumptive choice—can say that, really, it would prefer courts to wield that discretionary power.  But until then, the presumption cuts in the agency’s favor.<a aria-label=\"reference 2 of Kagan Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-2\" id=\"DISSENT_7-2ref\"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a>  The next question is why.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; For one, because agencies often know things about a statute’s subject matter that courts could not hope to.  The point is especially stark when the statute is of a “scientific or technical nature.”  <em>Kisor</em>, 588 U.&nbsp;S., at 571 (plurality opinion).  Agencies are staffed with “experts in the field” who can bring their training and knowledge to bear on open statutory questions.  <em>Chevron</em>, 467 U.&nbsp;S., at 865.  Consider, for example, the first bulleted case above.  When does an alpha amino acid polymer qualify as a “protein”?  See <em>supra</em>, at 5.  I don’t know many judges who would feel confident resolving that issue.  (First question: What even <em>is</em> an alpha amino acid polymer?)  But the FDA likely has scores of scientists on staff who can think intelligently about it, maybe collaborate with each other on its finer points, and arrive at a sensible answer.  Or take the perhaps more accessible-sounding second case, involving the Endangered Species Act.  See <em>supra</em>, at 5–6.  Deciding when one squirrel population is “distinct” from another (and thus warrants protection) requires knowing about species more than it does consulting a dictionary.  How much variation of what kind—geographic, genetic, morphological, or behavioral—should be required?  A court could, if forced to, muddle through that issue and announce a result.  But wouldn’t the Fish and Wildlife Service, with all its specialized expertise, do a better job of the task—of saying what, in the context of species protection, the open-ended term “distinct” means?  One idea behind the <em>Chevron </em>presumption is that Congress—&nbsp;the same Congress that charged the Service with implementing the Act—would answer that question with a resounding “yes.”</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> A second idea is that Congress would value the agency’s experience with how a complex regulatory regime functions, and with what is needed to make it effective.  Let’s stick with squirrels for a moment, except broaden the lens.  In construing a term like “distinct” in a case about squirrels, the Service likely would benefit from its “historical familiarity” with how the term has covered the population segments of other species.  <em>Martin</em> v. <em>Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm’n</em>, <a aria-label=\"499 U.

Just as a common-law court makes better decisions as it sees multiple variations on a theme, an agency’s construction of a statutory term benefits from its unique exposure to all the related ways the term comes into play.  Or consider, for another way regulatory familiarity matters, the example about adjusting Medicare reimbursement for geographic wage differences.  See <em>supra</em>, at 6.  According to a dictionary, the term “geographic area” could be as large as a multi-state region or as small as a census tract.  How to choose?  It would make sense to gather hard information about what reimbursement levels each approach will produce, to explore the ease of administering each on a nationwide basis, to survey how regulators have dealt with similar questions in the past, and to confer with the hospitals themselves about what makes sense.  See <em>Kisor</em>, 588 U.&nbsp;S., at 571 (plurality opinion) (noting that agencies are able to “conduct factual investigations” and “consult with affected parties”).  Congress knows the Department of Health and Human Services can do all those things—and that courts cannot.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Still more, <em>Chevron</em>’s presumption reflects that resolving &nbsp;statutory ambiguities, as Congress well knows, is “often more a question of policy than of law.”  <em>Pauley</em> v. <em>BethEnergy Mines, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"501 U. S. 680\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/501/680\">501 U.&nbsp;S. 680</a>, 696 (1991).  The task is less one of construing a text than of balancing competing goals and values.  Consider the statutory directive to achieve “substantial restoration of the [Grand Canyon’s] natural quiet.”  See <em>supra</em>, at 6.  Someone is going to have to decide exactly what that statute means for air traffic over the canyon.  How many flights, in what places and at what times, are consistent with restoring enough natural quiet on the ground?  That is a policy trade-off of a kind familiar to agencies—but peculiarly unsuited to judges.  Or consider <em>Chevron </em>itself.  As the Court there understood, the choice between defining a “stationary source” as a whole plant or as a pollution-emitting device is a choice about how to “reconcile” two “manifestly competing interests.”  467 U.&nbsp;S., at 865.  The plantwide definition relaxes the permitting requirement in the interest of promoting economic growth; the device-specific definition strengthens that requirement to better reduce air pollution.  See <em>id.</em>, at 851, 863, 866.  Again, that is a choice a judge should not be making, but one an agency properly can.  Agencies are “subject to the supervision of the President, who in turn answers to the public.”  <em>Kisor</em>, 588 U.&nbsp;S., at 571–572 (plurality opinion).  So when faced with a statutory ambiguity, “an agency to which Congress has delegated policymaking responsibilities” may rely on an accountable actor’s “views of wise policy to inform its judgments.”  <em>Chevron</em>, 467 U.&nbsp;S., at 865.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> None of this is to say that deference to agencies is always appropriate.  The Court over time has fine-tuned the <em>Chevron </em>regime to deny deference in classes of cases in which Congress has no reason to prefer an agency to a court.  The majority treats those “refinements” as a flaw in the scheme, <em>ante</em>, at 27, but they are anything but.  Consider the rule that an agency gets no deference when construing a statute it is not responsible for administering.  See <em>Epic Systems Corp.</em> v. <em>Lewis</em>, <a aria-label=\"584 U. S. 497\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/584/497\">584 U.&nbsp;S. 497</a>, 519–520 (2018).  Well, of course not—if Congress has not put an agency in charge of implementing a statute, Congress would not have given the agency a special role in its construction.  Or take the rule that an agency will not receive deference if it has reached its decision without using—or without using properly—its rulemaking or adjudicatory authority.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Mead Corp.</em>, <a aria-label=\"533 U. S. 218\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/533/218\">533 U.&nbsp;S. 218</a>, 226–227 (2001); <em>Encino Motorcars, LLC</em> v. <em>Navarro</em>, <a aria-label=\"579 U. S. 211\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/579/211\">579 U.&nbsp;S. 211</a>, 220 (2016).  Again, that should not be surprising: Congress expects that authoritative pronouncements on a law’s meaning will come from the procedures it has enacted to foster “fairness and deliberation” in agency decision-making.  <em>Mead</em>, 533 U.&nbsp;S., at 230.  Or finally, think of the “extraordinary cases” involving questions of vast “economic and political significance” in which the Court has declined to defer.  <em>King</em> v. <em>Burwell</em>, <a aria-label=\"576 U. S. 473\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/576/473\">576 U.&nbsp;S. 473</a>, 485–486 (2015).  The theory is that Congress would not have left matters of such import to an agency, but would instead have insisted on maintaining control.  So the <em>Chevron </em>refinements proceed from the same place as the original doctrine.  Taken together, they give interpretive primacy to the agency when—but only when—it is acting, as Congress specified, in the heartland of its delegated authority.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> That carefully calibrated framework “reflects a sensitivity to the proper roles of the political and judicial branches.”  <em>Pauley</em>, 501 U.&nbsp;S., at 696.  Where Congress has spoken, Congress has spoken; only its judgments matter.  And courts alone determine when that has happened: Using all their normal interpretive tools, they decide whether Congress has addressed a given issue.  But when courts have decided that Congress has not done so, a choice arises.  Absent a legislative directive, either the administering agency or a court must take the lead.  And the matter is more fit for the agency.  The decision is likely to involve the agency’s subject-matter expertise; to fall within its sphere of regulatory &nbsp;experience; and to involve policy choices, including cost-benefit assessments and trade-offs between conflicting values.  So a court without relevant expertise or experience, and without warrant to make policy calls, appropriately steps back.  The court still has a role to play: It polices the agency to ensure that it acts within the zone of reasonable options.  But the court does not insert itself into an agency’s expertise-driven, policy-laden functions.  That is the arrangement best suited to keep every actor in its proper lane.  And it is the one best suited to ensure that Congress’s statutes work in the way Congress intended.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The majority makes two points in reply, neither convincing.  First, it insists that “agencies have no special competence” in filling gaps or resolving ambiguities in regulatory statutes; rather, “[c]ourts do.”  <em>Ante</em>,<em> </em>at 23.  Score one for self-confidence; maybe not so high for self-reflection or &nbsp;-knowledge.  Of course courts often construe legal texts, hopefully well.  And <em>Chevron</em>’s first<em> </em>step takes full advantage of that talent: There, a court tries to divine what Congress meant, even in the most complicated or abstruse statutory schemes.  The deference comes in only if the court cannot do so—if the court must admit that standard legal tools will not avail to fill a statutory silence or give content to an ambiguous term.  That is when the issues look like the ones I started off with: When does an alpha amino acid polymer qualify as a “protein”?  How distinct is “distinct” for squirrel populations?  What size “geographic area” will ensure appropriate hospital reimbursement?  As between two equally feasible understandings of “stationary source,” should one choose the one more protective of the environment or the one more favorable to economic growth?  The idea that courts have “special competence” in deciding such questions whereas agencies have “no[ne]” is, if I may say, malarkey.  Answering those questions right does not mainly demand the interpretive skills courts possess.  Instead, it demands one or more of: subject-matter expertise, &nbsp;long engagement with a regulatory scheme, and policy choice.  It is courts (not agencies) that “have no special competence”—or even legitimacy—when those are the things a decision calls for.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Second, the majority complains that an ambiguity or gap does not “necessarily reflect a congressional intent that an agency” should have primary interpretive authority.  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  On that score, I’ll agree with the premise: It doesn’t “necessarily” do so.  <em>Chevron</em> is built on a <em>presumption</em>.  The decision does not maintain that Congress in every case wants the agency, rather than a court, to fill in gaps.  The decision maintains that when Congress does not expressly pick one or the other, we need a default rule; and the best default rule—agency or court?—is the one we think Congress would generally want.  As to <em>why </em>Congress would generally want the agency: The answer lies in everything said above about Congress’s delegation of regulatory power to the agency and the agency’s special competencies.  See <em>supra</em>, at 9–11.  The majority appears to think it is a showstopping rejoinder to note that many statutory gaps and ambiguities are “unintentional.”  <em>Ante</em>,<em> </em>at 22.  But to begin, many are not; the ratio between the two is uncertain.  See <em>supra</em>, at 4–5.  And to end, why should that matter in any event?  Congress may not have deliberately introduced a gap or ambiguity into the statute; but it knows that pretty much everything it drafts will someday be found to contain such a “flaw.”  Given that knowledge, <em>Chevron </em>asks, what would Congress want?  The presumed answer is again the same (for the same reasons): The agency.  And as with any default rule, if Congress decides otherwise, all it need do is say.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In that respect, the proof really is in the pudding: Congress basically never says otherwise, suggesting that <em>Chevron </em>chose the presumption aligning with legislative intent (or, in the majority’s words, “approximat[ing] reality,” <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 22).  Over the last four decades, Congress has authorized &nbsp;or reauthorized hundreds of statutes.  The drafters of those statutes knew all about <em>Chevron</em>.  See A. Gluck &amp; L. Bressman, Statutory Interpretation From the Inside—An Empirical Study of Congressional Drafting, Delegation, and the Canons: Part I, 65 Stan. L. Rev. 901, 928 (fig. 2), 994 (2013).  So if they had wanted a different assignment of interpretive responsibility, they would have inserted a provision to that effect.  With just a pair of exceptions I know of, they did not.  See <a aria-label=\"12 USC 25b b 5 A\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/25b#b_5_A\">12 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §25b(b)(5)(A)</a> (exception #1); <a aria-label=\"15 USC 8302 c 3 A\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/8302#c_3_A\">15 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §8302(c)(3)(A)</a> (exception #2).  Similarly, Congress has declined to enact proposed legislation that would abolish <em>Chevron </em>across the board.  See S. 909, 116th Cong., 1st Sess., §2 (2019) (still a bill, not a law); H. R. 5, 115th Cong., 1st Sess., §202 (2017) (same).  So to the extent the majority is worried that the <em>Chevron </em>presumption is “fiction[al],” <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 26—as all legal presumptions in some sense are—it has gotten less and less so every day for 40 years.  The congressional reaction shows as well as anything could that the <em>Chevron </em>Court read Congress right.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">II</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The majority’s principal arguments are in a different vein.  Around 80 years after the APA was enacted and 40 years after <em>Chevron</em>, the majority has decided that the former precludes the latter.  The APA’s Section 706, the majority says, “makes clear” that agency interpretations of statutes “are <em>not</em> entitled to deference.”  <em>Ante</em>, at 14–15 (emphasis in original).  And that provision, the majority continues, codified the contemporaneous law, which likewise did not allow for deference.  See <em>ante,</em> at 9–13, 15–16.  But neither the APA nor the pre-APA state of the law does the work that the majority claims.  Both are perfectly compatible with <em>Chevron </em>deference.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Section 706, enacted with the rest of the APA in 1946, provides for judicial review of agency action.  It states: “To the extent necessary to decision and when presented, the &nbsp;reviewing court shall decide all relevant questions of law, interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, and determine the meaning or applicability of the terms of an agency action.”  <a aria-label=\"5 USC 706\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/706\">5 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §706</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> That text, contra the majority, “does not resolve the <em>Chevron</em> question.”  C. Sunstein, <em>Chevron</em> As Law, 107 Geo. L. J. 1613, 1642 (2019) (Sunstein).  Or said a bit differently, Section 706 is “generally indeterminate” on the matter of deference.  A. Vermeule, Judging Under Uncertainty 207 (2006) (Vermeule).  The majority highlights the phrase “decide all relevant questions of law” (italicizing the “all”), and notes that the provision “prescribes no deferential standard” for answering those questions.  <em>Ante</em>, at 14.  But just as the provision does not prescribe a deferential standard of review, so too it does not prescribe a <em>de&nbsp;novo</em> standard of review (in which the court starts from scratch, without giving deference).  In point of fact, Section 706 does not specify <em>any</em> standard of review for construing statutes.  See <em>Kisor</em>, 588 U.&nbsp;S., at 581 (plurality opinion).<em> </em>And when a court uses a deferential standard—here, by deciding whether an agency reading is reasonable—it just as much “decide[s]” a “relevant question[&nbsp;] of law” as when it uses a <em>de&nbsp;novo</em> standard.  §706.  The deferring court then conforms to Section 706 “by determining whether the agency has stayed within the bounds of its assigned discretion—that is, whether the agency has construed [the statute it administers] reasonably.”  J. Manning, <em>Chevron </em>and the Reasonable Legislator, 128 Harv. L.&nbsp;Rev. 457, 459 (2014); see <em>Arlington</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, <a aria-label=\"569 U. S. 290\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/569/290\">569 U.&nbsp;S. 290</a>, 317 (2013) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Roberts</span>, C. J., dissenting) (“We do not ignore [Section 706’s] command when we afford an agency’s statutory interpretation <em>Chevron </em>deference; we respect it”).<a aria-label=\"reference 3 of Kagan Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-3\" id=\"DISSENT_7-3ref\"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; Section 706’s references to standards of review in other contexts only further undercut the majority’s argument.  The majority notes that Section 706 requires deferential review for agency fact-finding and policy-making (under, respectively, a substantial-evidence standard and an arbitrary-and-capricious standard).  See <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 14.  Congress, the majority claims, “surely would have articulated a similarly deferential standard applicable to questions of law had it intended to depart” from <em>de&nbsp;novo</em> review.  <em>Ibid.  </em>Surely?  In another part of Section 706, Congress explicitly referred to <em>de&nbsp;novo</em> review.  §706(2)(F).  With all those references to standards of review—both deferential and not—running around Section 706, what is “telling” (<em>ante</em>, at 14) is the absence of any standard for reviewing an agency’s statutory constructions.  That silence left the matter, as noted above, “generally indeterminate”: Section 706 neither mandates nor forbids <em>Chevron</em>-style deference.<em> </em> Vermeule 207.<a aria-label=\"reference 4 of Kagan Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-4\" id=\"DISSENT_7-4ref\"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; And contra the majority, most “respected commentators” understood Section 706 in that way—as allowing, even if not requiring, deference.  <em>Ante</em>,<em> </em>at 16.  The finest administrative law scholars of the time (call them that generation’s Manning, Sunstein, and Vermeule) certainly did.  Professor Louis Jaffe described something very like the <em>Chevron </em>two-step as the preferred method of reviewing agency interpretations under the APA.  A court, he said, first “must decide as a ‘question of law’ whether there is ‘discretion’ in the premises.”  Judicial Control of Administrative Action 570 (1965).  That is akin to step 1: Did Congress speak to the issue, or did it leave openness?  And if the latter, Jaffe continued, the agency’s view “if ‘reasonable’ is free of control.”  <em>Ibid.  </em>That of course looks like step 2: defer if reasonable.  And just in case that description was too complicated, Jaffe conveyed his main point this way: The argument that courts “must decide all questions of law”—as if there were no agency in the picture—“is, in my opinion, unsound.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 569.  Similarly, Professor Kenneth Culp Davis, author of the then-preeminent treatise on administrative law, noted with approval that “reasonableness” review of agency interpretations—in which courts “refused to substitute judgment”—had “survived the APA.”  Administrative Law 880, 883, 885 (1951) (Davis).  Other contemporaneous scholars and experts agreed.  See R. Levin, The APA and the Assault on Deference, 106 Minn. L. Rev. 125, 181–183 (2021) (Levin) (listing many of them).  They did not see in their own time what the majority finds there today.<a aria-label=\"reference 5 of Kagan Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-5\" id=\"DISSENT_7-5ref\"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; Nor, evidently, did the Supreme Court.  In the years after the APA was enacted, the Court “never indicated that section 706 rejected the idea that courts might defer to agency interpretations of law.”  Sunstein 1654.  Indeed, not a single Justice so much as floated that view of the APA.  To the contrary, the Court issued a number of decisions in those years deferring to an agency’s statutory interpretation.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Unemployment Compensation Comm’n of Alaska</em> v. <em>Aragon</em>, <a aria-label=\"329 U. S. 143\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/329/143\">329 U.&nbsp;S. 143</a>, 153–154 (1946); <em>NLRB</em> v. <em>E. C. Atkins &amp; Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"331 U. S. 398\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/331/398\">331 U.&nbsp;S. 398</a>, 403 (1947); <em>Cardillo</em> v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"330 U. S. 469\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/330/469\">330 U.&nbsp;S. 469</a>, 478–479 (1947).  And that continued right up until <em>Chevron</em>.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Mitchell</em> v. <em>Budd</em>, <a aria-label=\"350 U. S. 473\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/350/473\">350 U.&nbsp;S. 473</a>, 480 (1956); <em>Zenith Radio Corp.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"437 U. S. 443\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/437/443\">437 U.&nbsp;S. 443</a>, 450 (1978).  To be clear: Deference in those years was not always given to interpretations that would receive it under <em>Chevron</em>.  The practice then was more inconsistent and less fully elaborated than it later became.  The point here is only that the Court came nowhere close to accepting the majority’s view of the APA.  Take the language from Section 706 that the majority most relies on: “decide all relevant questions of law.”  See <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 14.  In the decade after the APA’s enactment, those words were used only four times in Supreme Court opinions (all in footnotes)—and never to suggest that courts could not defer to agency interpretations.  See Sunstein 1656.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">  The majority’s view of Section 706 likewise gets no support from how judicial review operated in the years leading up to the APA.  That prior history matters: As the majority recognizes, Section 706 was generally understood to “restate[&nbsp;] the present law as to the scope of judicial review.”  &nbsp;Dept. of Justice, Attorney General’s Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act 108 (1947); <em>ante</em>, at 15–16.  The problem for the majority is that in the years preceding the APA, courts became ever more deferential to agencies.  New Deal administrative programs had by that point come into their own.  And this Court and others, in a fairly short time, had abandoned their initial resistance and gotten on board.  Justice Breyer, wearing his administrative-law-scholar hat, characterized the pre-APA period this way: “[J]udicial review of administrative action was curtailed, and particular agency decisions were frequently sustained with judicial obeisance to the mysteries of administrative expertise.”  S. Breyer et&nbsp;al., Administrative Law and Regulatory Policy 21 (7th ed. 2011).  And that description extends to review of an agency’s statutory constructions.  An influential study of administrative practice, published five years before the APA’s enactment, described the state of play: Judicial “review may, in some instances at least, be limited to the inquiry whether the administrative construction is a permissible one.”  Final Report of Attorney General’s Committee on Administrative Procedure (1941), reprinted in Administrative Procedure in Government Agencies, S. Doc. No. 8, 77th Cong., 1st Sess., 78 (1941).  Or again: “[W]here the statute is reasonably susceptible of more than one interpretation, the court may accept that of the administrative body.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 90–91.<a aria-label=\"reference 6 of Kagan Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-6\" id=\"DISSENT_7-6ref\"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; Two prominent Supreme Court decisions of the 1940s put those principles into action.  <em>Gray</em> v. <em>Powell</em>, <a aria-label=\"314 U.S. 402\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/314/402\">314 U.&nbsp;S. 402 (1941)</a>, was then widely understood as “the leading case” on review of agency interpretations.  Davis 882; see <em>ibid. </em>(noting that it “establish[ed] what is known as ‘the doctrine of Gray v. Powell’&nbsp;”).  There, the Court deferred to an agency construction of the term “producer” as used in a statutory exemption from price controls.  Congress, the Court explained, had committed the scope of the exemption to the agency because its “experience in [the] field gave promise of a better informed, more equitable, adjustment of the conflicting interests.”  <em>Gray</em>, 314 U.&nbsp;S., at 412.  Accordingly, the Court concluded that it was “not the province of a court” to “substitute its judgment” for the agency’s.  <em>Ibid.  </em>Three years later, the Court decided <em>NLRB</em> v. <em>Hearst Publications, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"322 U.S. 111\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/322/111\">322 U.&nbsp;S. 111 (1944)</a>, another acknowledged “leading case.”  Davis 882; see <em>id.</em>, at 884.  The Court again deferred, this time to an agency’s construction of the term “employee” in the National Labor Relations Act.  The scope of that term, the Court explained, “belong[ed] to” the agency to answer based on its “[e]veryday experience in the administration of the statute.”  <em>Hearst</em>, 322 U.&nbsp;S., at 130.  The Court therefore “limited” its review to whether the agency’s reading had “warrant in the record and a reasonable basis in &nbsp;law.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 131.<a aria-label=\"reference 7 of Kagan Dissent\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-7\" id=\"DISSENT_7-7ref\"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup></a>  Recall here that even the majority accepts that Section 706 was meant to “restate[&nbsp;] the present law” as to judicial review.  See <em>ante</em>, at 15–16; <em>supra</em>, at 19–20.  Well then?  It sure would seem that the provision allows a deference regime.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The majority has no way around those two noteworthy decisions.  It first appears to distinguish between “pure legal question[s]” and the so-called mixed questions in <em>Gray </em>and <em>Hearst</em>,<em> </em>involving the application of a legal standard to a set of facts.  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  If in drawing that distinction, the majority intends to confine its holding to the pure type of legal issue—thus enabling courts to defer when law and facts are entwined—I’d be glad.  But I suspect the majority has no such intent, because that approach would preserve <em>Chevron </em>in a substantial part of its current domain.  Cf. <em>Wilkinson</em> v. <em>Garland</em>, <a aria-label=\"601 U. S. 209\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/601/209\">601 U.&nbsp;S. 209</a>, 230 (2024) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Alito, J.,</span> dissenting) (noting, in the immigration context, that the universe of mixed questions swamps that of pure legal ones).  It is frequently in the consideration of mixed questions that the scope of statutory terms is established and their meaning defined.  See H. Monaghan, <em>Marbury</em> and the &nbsp;Administrative State, 83 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 29 (1983) (“Administrative application of law is administrative formulation of law whenever it involves elaboration of the statutory norm”).  How does a statutory interpreter decide, as in <em>Hearst</em>, what an “employee” is?  In large part through cases asking whether the term covers people performing specific jobs, like (in that case) “newsboys.”  322 U.&nbsp;S., at 120.  Or consider one of the examples I offered above.  How does an interpreter decide when one population segment of a species is “distinct” from another?  Often by considering that requirement with respect to particular species, like western gray squirrels.  So the distinction the majority offers makes no real-world (or even theoretical) sense.  If the <em>Hearst </em>Court was deferring to an agency on whether the term “employee” covered newsboys, it was deferring to the agency on the scope and meaning of the term “employee.”</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The majority’s next rejoinder—that “the Court was far from consistent” in deferring—falls equally flat.  <em>Ante</em>, at 12.  I am perfectly ready to acknowledge that in the pre-APA period, a deference regime had not yet taken complete hold.  I’ll go even further: Let’s assume that deference was then an on-again, off-again function (as the majority seems to suggest, see <em>ante</em>, at 11–12, and 13, n.&nbsp;3).  Even on that assumption, the majority’s main argument—that Section 706 <em>prohibited </em>deferential review—collapses.  Once again, the majority agrees that Section 706 was not meant to change the then-prevailing law.  See <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 15–16.  And even if inconsistent, that law cannot possibly be thought to have <em>prohibited </em>deference.  Or otherwise said: “If Section 706 did not change the law of judicial review (as we have long recognized), then it did not proscribe a deferential standard then known and in use.”  <em>Kisor</em>, 588 U.&nbsp;S., at 583 (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The majority’s whole argument for overturning <em>Chevron </em>relies on Section 706.  But the text of Section 706 does not support that result.  And neither does the contemporaneous &nbsp;practice, which that text was supposed to reflect.  So today’s decision has no basis in the only law the majority deems relevant.  It is grounded on air.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">III</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> And still there is worse, because abandoning <em>Chevron </em>subverts every known principle of <em>stare decisis</em>.  Of course, respecting precedent is not an “inexorable command.”  <em>Payne</em> v. <em>Tennessee</em>, <a aria-label=\"501 U. S. 808\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/501/808\">501 U.&nbsp;S. 808</a>, 828 (1991).  But overthrowing it requires far more than the majority has offered up here.  <em>Chevron </em>is entitled to <em>stare decisis</em>’s strongest form of protection.  The majority thus needs an exceptionally strong reason to overturn the decision, above and beyond thinking it wrong.  And it has nothing approaching such a justification, proposing only a bewildering theory about <em>Chevron</em>’s “unworkability.”  <em>Ante</em>,<em> </em>at 32.  Just five years ago, this Court in <em>Kisor </em>rejected a plea to overrule <em>Auer</em> v. <em>Robbins</em>, <a aria-label=\"519 U.S. 452\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/519/452\">519 U.&nbsp;S. 452 (1997)</a>, which requires judicial deference to agencies’ interpretations of their own regulations.  See 588 U.&nbsp;S., at 586–589 (opinion of the Court).  The case against overruling <em>Chevron </em>is at least as strong.  In particular, the majority’s decision today will cause a massive shock to the legal system, “cast[ing] doubt on many settled constructions” of statutes and threatening the interests of many parties who have relied on them for years.  588 U.&nbsp;S., at 587 (opinion of the Court).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Adherence to precedent is “a foundation stone of the rule of law.”  <em>Michigan</em> v. <em>Bay Mills Indian Community</em>, <a aria-label=\"572 U. S. 782\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/572/782\">572 U.&nbsp;S. 782</a>, 798 (2014).  <em>Stare decisis</em> “promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles.”  <em>Payne</em>, 501 U.&nbsp;S., at 827.  It enables people to order their lives in reliance on judicial decisions.  And it “contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process,” by ensuring that those decisions are founded in the law, and not in the “personal preferences” of judges.  <em>Id.</em>, at 828; <em>Dobbs</em>, 597 U.&nbsp;S., at 388 (dissenting opinion).  &nbsp;Perhaps above all else, <em>stare decisis</em> is a “doctrine of judicial modesty.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 363.  In that, it shares something important with <em>Chevron</em>.  Both tell judges that they do not know everything, and would do well to attend to the views of others.  So today, the majority rejects what judicial humility counsels not just once but twice over.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> And <em>Chevron </em>is entitled to a particularly strong form of <em>stare decisis</em>, for two separate reasons.  First, it matters that “Congress remains free to alter what we have done.”  <em>Patterson</em> v. <em>McLean Credit Union</em>, <a aria-label=\"491 U. S. 164\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/491/164\">491 U.&nbsp;S. 164</a>, 173 (1989); see <em>Kisor</em>, 588 U.&nbsp;S., at 587 (opinion of the Court) (making the same point for <em>Auer </em>deference).  In a constitutional case, the Court alone can correct an error.  But that is not so here.  “Our deference decisions are balls tossed into Congress’s court, for acceptance or not as that branch elects.”  588 U.&nbsp;S., at 587–588 (opinion of the Court).  And for generations now, Congress has chosen acceptance.  Throughout those years, Congress could have abolished <em>Chevron </em>across the board, most easily by amending the APA.  Or it could have eliminated deferential review in discrete areas, by amending old laws or drafting new laws to include an anti-<em>Chevron </em>provision.  Instead, Congress has “spurned multiple opportunities” to do a comprehensive rejection of <em>Chevron</em>, and has hardly ever done a targeted one.  <em>Kimble</em> v. <em>Marvel Entertainment, LLC</em>, <a aria-label=\"576 U. S. 446\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/576/446\">576 U.&nbsp;S. 446</a>, 456 (2015); see <em>supra</em>, at 14–15.  Or to put the point more affirmatively, Congress has kept <em>Chevron </em>as is for 40 years.  It maintained that position even as Members of this Court began to call <em>Chevron </em>into question.  See <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 30.  From all it appears, Congress has not agreed with the view of some Justices that they and other judges should have more power.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Second, <em>Chevron </em>is by now much more than a single decision.  This Court alone, acting as <em>Chevron</em> allows, has upheld an agency’s reasonable interpretation of a statute at least 70 times.  See Brief for United States in No. 22–1219, &nbsp;p. 27; App. to <em>id</em>., at 68a–72a (collecting cases).  Lower courts have applied the <em>Chevron </em>framework on thousands upon thousands of occasions.  See K. Barnett &amp; C. Walker, <em>Chevron </em>and Stare Decisis, 31 Geo. Mason L.&nbsp;Rev. 475, 477, and n.&nbsp;11 (2024) (noting that at last count, <em>Chevron </em>was cited in more than 18,000 federal-court decisions).  The <em>Kisor </em>Court observed, when upholding <em>Auer</em>, that “[d]eference to reasonable agency interpretations of ambiguous rules pervades the whole corpus of administrative law.”  588 U.&nbsp;S., at 587 (opinion of the Court).  So too does deference to reasonable agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes—except more so.  <em>Chevron </em>is as embedded as embedded gets in the law.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The majority says differently, because this Court has ignored <em>Chevron</em> lately; all that is left of the decision is a “decaying husk with bold pretensions.”  <em>Ante</em>, at 33.  Tell that to the D.&nbsp;C. Circuit, the court that reviews a large share of agency interpretations, where <em>Chevron </em>remains alive and well.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Lissack </em>v. <em>Commissioner</em>, 68 F. 4th 1312, 1321–1322 (2023); <em>Solar Energy Industries Assn. </em>v. <em>FERC</em>, 59 F. 4th 1287, 1291–1294 (2023).  But more to the point: The majority’s argument is a bootstrap.  This Court has “avoided deferring under <em>Chevron </em>since 2016” (<em>ante</em>, at 32) because it has been preparing to overrule <em>Chevron </em>since around that time.  That kind of self-help on the way to reversing precedent has become almost routine at this Court.  Stop applying a decision where one should; “throw some gratuitous criticisms into a couple of opinions”; issue a few separate writings “question[ing the decision’s] premises” (<em>ante</em>, at 30); give the whole process a few years .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and voila!—you have a justification for overruling the decision.  <em>Janus</em> v. <em>State, County, and Municipal Employees</em>, <a aria-label=\"585 U. S. 878\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/585/878\">585 U.&nbsp;S. 878</a>, 950 (2018) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Kagan, J.</span>, dissenting) (discussing the overruling of <em>Abood</em> v. <em>Detroit Bd. of Ed.</em>, <a aria-label=\"431 U.S. 209\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/431/209\">431 U.&nbsp;S. 209 (1977)</a>); see also, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Kennedy</em> v. <em>Bremerton School Dist.</em>, <a aria-label=\"597 U. S. 507\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/597/507\">597 U.&nbsp;S. 507</a>, 571–572 (2022) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Sotomayor, J.</span>, dissenting) (similar &nbsp;for <em>Lemon</em> v. <em>Kurtzman</em>, <a aria-label=\"403 U.S. 602\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/403/602\">403 U.&nbsp;S. 602 (1971)</a>); <em>Shelby County</em> v. <em>Holder</em>, <a aria-label=\"570 U.

I once remarked that this overruling-through-enfeeblement technique “mock[ed] <em>stare decisis</em>.”  <em>Janus</em>, 585 U.&nbsp;S., at 950 (dissenting opinion).  I have seen no reason to change my mind.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The majority does no better in its main justification for overruling <em>Chevron</em>—that the decision is “unworkable.”  <em>Ante</em>, at 30.  The majority’s first theory on that score is that there is no single “answer” about what “ambiguity” means: Some judges turn out to see more of it than others do, leading to “different results.”  <em>Ante</em>, at 30–31.  But even if so, the legal system has for many years, in many contexts, dealt perfectly well with that variation.  Take contract law.  It is hornbook stuff that when (but only when) a contract is ambiguous, a court interpreting it can consult extrinsic evidence.  See <em>CNH Industrial N.V.</em> v. <em>Reese</em>, <a aria-label=\"583 U. S. 133\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/583/133\">583 U.&nbsp;S. 133</a>, 139 (2018) (<em>per curiam</em>).  And when all interpretive tools still leave ambiguity, the contract is construed against the drafter.  See <em>Lamps Plus, Inc.</em> v. <em>Varela</em>, <a aria-label=\"587 U. S. 176\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/587/176\">587 U.&nbsp;S. 176</a>, 186–187 (2019).  So I guess the contract rules of the 50 States are unworkable now.  Or look closer to home, to doctrines this Court regularly applies.  In deciding whether a government has waived sovereign immunity, we construe “[a]ny ambiguities in the statutory language” in “favor of immunity.”  <em>FAA</em> v. <em>Cooper</em>, <a aria-label=\"566 U. S. 284\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/566/284\">566 U.&nbsp;S. 284</a>, 290 (2012).  Similarly, the rule of lenity tells us to construe ambiguous statutes in favor of criminal defendants.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Castleman</em>, <a aria-label=\"572 U. S. 157\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/572/157\">572 U.&nbsp;S. 157</a>, 172–173 (2014).  And the canon of constitutional avoidance instructs us to construe ambiguous laws to avoid difficult constitutional questions.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Oakland Cannabis Buyers’ Cooperative</em>, <a aria-label=\"532 U. S. 483\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/532/483\">532 U.&nbsp;S. 483</a>, 494 (2001).  I could go on, but the point is made.  There are ambiguity triggers all over the law.  Somehow everyone seems to get by.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; And <em>Chevron </em>is an especially puzzling decision to criticize on the ground of generating too much judicial divergence.  There’s good empirical—meaning, non-impressionistic—evidence on exactly that subject.  And it shows that, as compared with <em>de&nbsp;novo</em> review, use of the <em>Chevron </em>two-step framework fosters <em>agreement</em> among judges.  See K. Barnett, C. Boyd, &amp; C. Walker, Administrative Law’s Political Dynamics, 71 Vand. L.&nbsp;Rev. 1463, 1502 (2018) (Barnett).  More particularly, <em>Chevron</em> has a “powerful constraining effect on partisanship in judicial decisionmaking.”  Barnett 1463 (italics deleted); see Sunstein 1672 (“[A] predictable effect of overruling <em>Chevron </em>would be to ensure a far greater role for judicial policy preferences in statutory interpretation and far more common splits along ideological lines”).  So if consistency among judges is the majority’s lodestar, then the Court should not overrule <em>Chevron</em>, but return to using it.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The majority’s second theory on workability is likewise a makeweight.  <em>Chevron</em>, the majority complains, has some exceptions, which (so the majority says) are “difficult” and “complicate[d]” to apply.  <em>Ante</em>,<em> </em>at 32.  Recall that courts are not supposed to defer when the agency construing a statute (1) has not been charged with administering that law; (2) has not used deliberative procedures—<em>i.e., </em>notice-and-comment rulemaking or adjudication; or (3) is intervening in a “major question,” of great economic and political significance.  See <em>supra</em>, at 11–12; <em>ante</em>, at 27–28.  As I’ve explained, those exceptions—the majority also aptly calls them “refinements”—fit with <em>Chevron</em>’s rationale: They define circumstances in which Congress is unlikely to have wanted agency views to govern.  <em>Ante</em>, at 27; see <em>supra</em>, at 11–12.  And on the difficulty scale, they are nothing much.  Has Congress put the agency in charge of administering the statute?  In 99 of 100 cases, everyone will agree on the answer with scarcely a moment’s thought.  Did the agency use notice-and-comment or an adjudication before rendering an &nbsp;interpretation?  Once again, I could stretch my mind and think up a few edge cases, but for the most part, the answer is an easy yes or no.  The major questions exception is, I acknowledge, different: There, many judges have indeed disputed its nature and scope.  Compare, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., <em>West Virginia</em>, 597 U.&nbsp;S., at 721–724, with <em>id</em>., at 764–770 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Kagan</span>, J., dissenting).  But that disagreement concerns, on everyone’s view, a tiny subset of all agency interpretations.  For the most part, the exceptions that so upset the majority require merely a rote, check-the-box inquiry.  If that is the majority’s idea of a “dizzying breakdance,” <em>ante</em>, at 32, the majority needs to get out more.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> And anyway, difficult as compared to what?  The majority’s prescribed way of proceeding is no walk in the park.  First, the majority makes clear that what is usually called <em>Skidmore </em>deference continues to apply.  See <em>ante</em>, at 16–17.  Under that decision, agency interpretations “constitute a body of experience and informed judgment” that may be “entitled to respect.”  <em>Skidmore</em> v. <em>Swift &amp; Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"323 U. S. 134\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/323/134\">323 U.&nbsp;S. 134</a>, 140 (1944).  If the majority thinks that the same judges who argue today about where “ambiguity” resides (see <em>ante</em>, at 30) are not going to argue tomorrow about what “respect” requires, I fear it will be gravely disappointed.  Second, the majority directs courts to comply with the varied ways in which Congress in fact “delegates discretionary authority” to agencies.  <em>Ante</em>, at 17–18.  For example, Congress may authorize an agency to “define[&nbsp;]” or “delimit[&nbsp;]” statutory terms or concepts, or to “fill up the details” of a statutory scheme.  <em>Ante</em>,<em> </em>at 17, and n.&nbsp;5.<em> </em>Or Congress may use, in describing an agency’s regulatory authority, inherently “flexib[le]” language like “appropriate” or “reasonable.”  <em>Ante</em>,<em> </em>at 17, and n. 6.  Attending to every such delegation, as the majority says, is necessary in a world without <em>Chevron</em>.  But that task involves complexities of its own.  Indeed, one reason Justice Scalia supported <em>Chevron </em>was that it re&nbsp;placed such a “statute-by-statute evaluation (which was assuredly a font of uncertainty and litigation) with an across-the-board presumption.”  A. Scalia, Judicial Deference to Administrative Interpretations of Law, 1989 Duke L. J. 511, 516.  As a lover of the predictability that rules create, Justice Scalia thought the latter “unquestionably better.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 517.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> On the other side of the balance, the most important <em>stare decisis</em> factor—call it the “jolt to the legal system” issue—weighs heavily against overruling <em>Chevron</em>.  <em>Dobbs</em>, 597 U.&nbsp;S., at 357 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Roberts, C.&nbsp;J.</span>, concurring in judgment).  Congress and agencies alike have relied on <em>Chevron</em>—have assumed its existence—in much of their work for the last 40 years.  Statutes passed during that time reflect the expectation that <em>Chevron </em>would allocate interpretive authority between agencies and courts.  Rules issued during the period likewise presuppose that statutory ambiguities were the agencies’ to (reasonably) resolve.  Those agency interpretations may have benefited regulated entities; or they may have protected members of the broader public.  Either way, private parties have ordered their affairs—their business and financial decisions, their health-care decisions, their educational decisions—around agency actions that are suddenly now subject to challenge.  In <em>Kisor</em>, this Court refused to overrule <em>Auer </em>because doing so would “cast doubt on” many longstanding constructions of rules, and thereby upset settled expectations.  588 U.&nbsp;S., at 587 (opinion of the Court).  Overruling <em>Chevron</em>, and thus raising new doubts about agency constructions of statutes,<em> </em>will be far more disruptive.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The majority tries to alleviate concerns about a piece of that problem: It states that judicial decisions that have upheld agency action as reasonable under <em>Chevron </em>should not be overruled on that account alone.  See <em>ante</em>, at 34–35.  That is all to the good: There are thousands of such decisions, many settled for decades.  See <em>supra</em>, at 26.  But first, &nbsp;reasonable reliance need not be predicated on a prior judicial decision.  Some agency interpretations never challenged under <em>Chevron </em>now will be; expectations formed around those constructions thus could be upset, in a way the majority’s assurance does not touch.  And anyway, how good is that assurance, really?  The majority says that a decision’s “[m]ere reliance on <em>Chevron</em>”<em> </em>is not enough to counter the force of <em>stare decisis</em>; a challenger will need an additional “special justification.”  <em>Ante</em>, at 34.  The majority is sanguine; I am not so much.  Courts motivated to overrule an old <em>Chevron</em>-based decision can always come up with something to label a “special justification.”  Maybe a court will say “the quality of [the precedent’s] reasoning” was poor.  <em>Ante</em>, at 29.<em> </em>Or maybe the court will discover something “unworkable” in the decision—like some exception that has to be applied.  <em>Ante</em>, at 30.<em> </em>All a court need do is look to today’s opinion to see how it is done.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">IV</h3>\n<p class=\"bqonly1para jy-both indent_l-270 indent_r-320\">Judges are not experts in the field, and are not part of either political branch of the Government.</p>\n<p class=\"bqonly1para jy-both indent_l-1008 indent_r-317\"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;— Chevron U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural ResourcesDefense Council, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"467 U. S. 837\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/467/837\">467 U.&nbsp;S. 837</a>, 865 (1984)</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Those were the days, when we knew what we are not.  When we knew that as between courts and agencies, Congress would usually think agencies the better choice to resolve the ambiguities and fill the gaps in regulatory statutes.  Because agencies <em>are</em> “experts in the field.”  And because they <em>are</em> part of a political branch, with a claim to making interstitial policy.  And because Congress has charged them, not us, with administering the statutes containing the open questions.  At its core, <em>Chevron </em>is about respecting that allocation of responsibility—the conferral of primary authority over regulatory matters to agencies, not courts.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; Today, the majority does not respect that judgment.  It gives courts the power to make all manner of scientific and technical judgments.  It gives courts the power to make all manner of policy calls, including about how to weigh competing goods and values.  (See <em>Chevron </em>itself.)  It puts courts at the apex of the administrative process as to every conceivable subject—because there are always gaps and ambiguities in regulatory statutes, and often of great import.  What actions can be taken to address climate change or other environmental challenges?  What will the Nation’s health-care system look like in the coming decades?  Or the financial or transportation systems?  What rules are going to constrain the development of A.I.?  In every sphere of current or future federal regulation, expect courts from now on to play a commanding role.  It is not a role Congress has given to them, in the APA or any other statute.  It is a role this Court has now claimed for itself, as well as for other judges.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> And that claim requires disrespecting, too, this Court’s precedent.  There are no special reasons, of the kind usually invoked for overturning precedent, to eliminate <em>Chevron </em>deference.  And given <em>Chevron</em>’s pervasiveness,<em> </em>the decision to do so is likely to produce large-scale disruption.  All that backs today’s decision is the majority’s belief that <em>Chevron </em>was wrong—that it gave agencies too much power and courts not enough.  But shifting views about the worth of regulatory actors and their work do not justify overhauling a cornerstone of administrative law.  In that sense too, today’s majority has lost sight of its proper role.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> And it is impossible to pretend that today’s decision is a one-off, in either its treatment of agencies or its treatment of precedent.  As to the first, this very Term presents yet another example of the Court’s resolve to roll back agency authority, despite congressional direction to the contrary.  See <em>SEC</em> v. <em>Jarkesy</em>, 603 U.&nbsp;S. ___ (2024); see also <em>supra</em>, at 3.  As to the second, just my own defenses of <em>stare decisis</em>—&nbsp;my own dissents to this Court’s reversals of settled law—by now fill a small volume.  See <em>Dobbs</em>, 597 U.&nbsp;S., at 363–364 (joint opinion of Breyer, <span class=\"smallcaps\">Sotomayor</span>, and <span class=\"smallcaps\">Kagan</span>, JJ.); <em>Edwards</em> v. <em>Vannoy</em>, <a aria-label=\"593 U.

Once again, with respect, I dissent.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<h3 class=\"fnheader\">Notes</h3>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_7-1\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Kagan Dissent at reference 1\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-1ref\">1</a> *<span class=\"smallcaps\">Justice Jackson</span> did not participate in the consideration or decision of the case in No. 22–451 and joins this opinion only as it applies to the case in No. 22–1219.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_7-2\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Kagan Dissent at reference 2\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-2ref\">2</a> &nbsp;Note that presumptions of this kind are common in the law.  In other contexts, too, the Court responds to a congressional lack of direction by adopting a presumption about what Congress wants, rather than trying to figure that out in every case.  And then Congress can legislate, with “predictable effects,” against that “stable background” rule.  <em>Morrison</em> v. <em>National Australia Bank Ltd.</em>, <a aria-label=\"561 U. S. 247\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/561/247\">561 U.&nbsp;S. 247</a>, 261 (2010).  Take the presumption against extraterritoriality: The Court assumes Congress means for its statutes to apply only within the United States, absent a “clear indication” to the contrary.  <em>Id.</em>, at 255.  Or the presumption against retroactivity: The Court assumes Congress wants its laws to apply only prospectively, unless it “unambiguously instruct[s]” something different.  <em>Vartelas</em> v. <em>Holder</em>, <a aria-label=\"566 U. S. 257\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/566/257\">566 U.&nbsp;S. 257</a>, 266 (2012).  Or the presumption against repeal of statutes by implication: The Court assumes Congress does not intend a later statute to displace an earlier one unless it makes that intention “clear and manifest.”  <em>Epic Systems Corp.</em> v. <em>Lewis</em>, <a aria-label=\"584 U. S. 497\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/584/497\">584 U.&nbsp;S. 497</a>, 510 (2018).

S. 199\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/596/199\">596 U.&nbsp;S. 199</a>, 203 (2022).  I could continue, except that this footnote is long enough.  The <em>Chevron </em>deference rule is to the same effect: The Court generally assumes that Congress intends to confer discretion on agencies to handle statutory ambiguities or gaps, absent a direction to the contrary.  The majority calls that presumption a “fiction,” <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 26, but it is no more so than any of the presumptions listed above.  They all are best guesses—and usually quite good guesses—by courts about congressional intent.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_7-3\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Kagan Dissent at reference 3\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-3ref\">3</a> &nbsp;The majority tries to buttress its argument with a stray sentence or two from the APA’s legislative history, but the same response holds.  As the majority notes, see <em>ante</em>, at 15, the House and Senate Reports each stated that Section 706 “provid[ed] that questions of law are for courts rather than agencies to decide in the last analysis.”  H.&nbsp;R. Rep. No. 1980, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 44 (1946); S. Rep. No. 752, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 28 (1945).  But that statement also does not address the standard of review that courts should then use.  When a court defers under <em>Chevron</em>, it reviews the agency’s construction for reasonableness “in the last analysis.”  The views of Representative Walter, which the majority also cites, further demonstrate my point.  He stated that the APA would require courts to “determine independently all relevant questions of law,” but he also stated that courts would be required to “exercise .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. independent judgment” in applying the substantial-evidence standard (a deferential standard if ever there were one).  92 Cong. Rec. 5654 (1946).  He therefore did not equate “independent” review with <em>de&nbsp;novo</em> review; he thought that a court could conduct independent review of agency action using a deferential standard.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_7-4\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Kagan Dissent at reference 4\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-4ref\">4</a> &nbsp;In a footnote responding to the last two paragraphs, the majority raises the white flag on Section 706’s text.  See <em>ante</em>, at 15, n.&nbsp;4.  Yes, it finally concedes, Section 706 does not <em>say </em>that <em>de&nbsp;novo</em> review is required for an agency’s statutory construction.  Rather, the majority says, “some things go without saying,” and <em>de&nbsp;novo</em> review is such a thing.  See <em>ibid.  </em>But why?  What extra-textual considerations force us to read Section 706 the majority’s way?  In its footnote, the majority repairs only to history.  But as I will explain below, the majority also gets wrong the most relevant history, pertaining to how judicial review of agency interpretations operated in the years before the APA was enacted.  See <em>infra</em>, at 19–23.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_7-5\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Kagan Dissent at reference 5\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-5ref\">5</a> &nbsp;I concede one exception (whose view was “almost completely isolated,” Levin 181), but his comments on Section 706 refute a different aspect of the majority’s argument.  Professor John Dickinson, as the majority notes, thought that Section 706 precluded courts from deferring to agency interpretations.  See Administrative Procedure Act: Scope and Grounds of Broadened Judicial Review, 33 A. B. A. J. 434, 516 (1947) (Dickinson); <em>ante</em>, at 16.  But unlike the majority, he viewed that bar as “a change” to, not a restatement of, pre-APA law.  Compare Dickinson 516 with <em>ante</em>, at 15–16.  So if the majority really wants to rely on Professor Dickinson, it will have to give up the claim, which I address below, that the law before the APA forbade deference.  See <em>infra</em>, at 19–23.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_7-6\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Kagan Dissent at reference 6\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-6ref\">6</a> &nbsp;Because the APA was meant to “restate[&nbsp;] the present law,” the judicial review practices of the 1940s are more important to understanding the statute than is any earlier tradition (such as the majority dwells on).  But before I expand on those APA-contemporaneous practices, I pause to note that they were “not built on sand.”  <em>Kisor</em> v. <em>Wilkie</em>, <a aria-label=\"588 U. S. 558\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/588/558\">588 U.&nbsp;S. 558</a>, 568–569 (2019) (plurality opinion).  Since the early days of the Republic, this Court has given significant weight to official interpretations of “ambiguous law[s].”  <em>Edwards’ Lessee</em> v. <em>Darby</em>, 12 Wheat. 206, 210 (1827).  With the passage of time—and the growth of the administrative sphere—those “judicial expressions of deference increased.”  H. Monaghan, <em>Marbury </em>and the Administrative State, 83 Colum. L.&nbsp;Rev. 1, 15 (1983).  By the early 20th century, the Court stated that it would afford “great weight” to an agency construction in the face of statutory “uncertainty or ambiguity.”  <em>National Lead Co.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"252 U. S. 140\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/252/140\">252 U.&nbsp;S. 140</a>, 145 (1920); see <em>Schell’s Executors</em> v. <em>Fauché</em>, <a aria-label=\"138 U. S. 562\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/138/562\">138 U.&nbsp;S. 562</a>, 572 (1891) (“controlling” weight in “all cases of ambiguity”); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Alabama Great Southern R. Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"142 U. S. 615\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/142/615\">142 U.&nbsp;S. 615</a>, 621 (1892) (“decisive” weight “in case of ambiguity”); <em>Jacobs</em> v. <em>Prichard</em>, <a aria-label=\"223 U. S. 200\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/223/200\">223 U.&nbsp;S. 200</a>, 214 (1912) (referring to the “rule which gives strength” to official interpretations if “ambiguity exist[s]”).  So even before the New Deal, a strand of this Court’s cases exemplified deference to executive constructions of ambiguous statutes.  And then, as I show in the text, the New Deal arrived and deference surged—creating the “present law” that the APA “restated.”</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"DISSENT_7-7\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Kagan Dissent at reference 7\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#DISSENT_7-7ref\">7</a> &nbsp;The majority says that I have “pluck[ed] out” <em>Gray </em>and <em>Hearst</em>, impliedly from a vast number of not-so-helpful cases.  <em>Ante</em>,<em> </em>at 13, n.&nbsp;3.  It would make as much sense to say that a judge “plucked out” <em>Universal Camera Corp.</em> v. <em>NLRB</em>, <a aria-label=\"340 U.S. 474\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/340/474\">340 U.&nbsp;S. 474 (1951)</a>, to discuss substantial-evidence review or “plucked out” <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc.</em> v. <em>State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"463 U.S. 29\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/463/29\">463 U.&nbsp;S. 29 (1983)</a>, to discuss arbitrary-and-capricious review.  <em>Gray </em>and <em>Hearst</em>, as noted above, were the leading cases about agency interpretations in the years before the APA’s enactment.  But just to gild the lily, here are a number of other Supreme Court decisions from the five years prior to the APA’s enactment that were of a piece: <em>United States</em> v. <em>Pierce Auto Freight Lines, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"327 U. S. 515\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/327/515\">327 U.&nbsp;S. 515</a>, 536 (1946); <em>ICC</em> v. <em>Parker</em>, <a aria-label=\"326 U. S. 60\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/326/60\">326 U.&nbsp;S. 60</a>, 65 (1945); <em>Federal Security Administrator</em> v. <em>Quaker Oats Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"318 U. S. 218\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/318/218\">318 U.&nbsp;S. 218</a>, 227–228 (1943).  The real “pluck[ing]” offense is the majority’s—for taking a stray sentence from <em>Hearst </em>(<em>ante</em>, at 13, n.&nbsp;3) to suggest that both <em>Hearst </em>and <em>Gray</em> stand for the opposite of what they actually do.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tab-pane\" id=\"tab_default_2\">\n<!-- 'notes' content area -->\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

See Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, §5/24–1.9(a)(1)(J)(ii)(II) (West 2023).  “The AR–15 is the most popular semi-automatic rifle” in America and is therefore undeniably “in common use today.”  <em>Heller</em> v. <em>District of Columbia</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/670_F.3d_1244\">670 F.&nbsp;3d 1244</a>, 1287 (CADC 2011) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Kavanaugh, J.</span>, dissenting); see also <em>Garland</em> v. <em>Cargill</em>, <a aria-label=\"602 U. S. 406\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/602/406\">602 U.&nbsp;S. 406</a>, 430–431 (2024) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Sotomayor, J.</span>, dissenting) (describing “semiautomatic rifles” such as the AR–15 as “commonly available”).  Petitioners sought a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of the law, arguing that the law violates their <a aria-label=\"US Constitution second Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment\">Second Amendment</a> right to “keep and bear Arms.”  The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit rejected petitioners’ request for a preliminary injunction, concluding “that the AR–15 .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is not protected by the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution second Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment\">Second Amendment</a>.”  <em>Bevis</em> v. <em>Naperville</em>, 85 F.&nbsp;4th 1175, 1197 (2023).  According to the Seventh Circuit, the rifle selected by millions of Americans for self-defense and other lawful purposes does not even fall within the scope of the Arms referred to by the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution second Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment\">Second Amendment</a>.  <em>Ibid</em>.  This Court is rightly wary of taking cases in an interlocutory posture.  But, I hope we will consider the important issues presented by these petitions after the cases reach final judgment.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> We have never squarely addressed what types of weapons are “Arms” protected by the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution second Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment\">Second Amendment</a>.  To be sure, we explained in <em>District of Columbia</em> v. <em>Heller</em>, <a aria-label=\"554 U.S. 570\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/554/570\">554 U.&nbsp;S. 570 (2008)</a>, that the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution second Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment\">Second Amendment</a>’s protection “extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence at the &nbsp;time of the founding.”  <em>Id</em>., at 582.  And, we noted that “the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution second Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment\">Second Amendment</a> does not protect those weapons not typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes,” <em>id</em>., at 625, recognizing “the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons,” <em>id.</em>, at 627 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Caetano </em>v. <em>Massachusetts</em>, <a aria-label=\"577 U. S. 411\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/577/411\">577 U.&nbsp;S. 411</a>, 417–419 (2016) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Alito, J.</span>, concurring in judgment).  But, this minimal guidance is far from a comprehensive framework for evaluating restrictions on types of weapons, and it leaves open essential questions such as what makes a weapon “bearable,” “dangerous,” or “unusual.”</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Seventh Circuit’s decision illustrates why this Court must provide more guidance on which weapons the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution second Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment\">Second Amendment</a> covers.  By contorting what little guidance our precedents provide, the Seventh Circuit concluded that the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution second Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment\">Second Amendment</a> does not protect “militaristic” weapons.  See 85 F.&nbsp;4th, at 1199.  It then tautologically defined “militaristic” weapons as those “that may be reserved for military use.”  <em>Id</em>., at 1194.  The Seventh Circuit’s contrived “non-militaristic” limitation on the Arms protected by the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution second Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment\">Second Amendment</a> seems unmoored from both text and history.  See <em>Friedman</em> v. <em>Highland Park</em>, <a aria-label=\"577 U. S. 1039\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/577/1039\">577 U.&nbsp;S. 1039</a>, 1041 (2015) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas, J.,</span> dissenting from denial of certiorari).  And, even on its own terms, the Seventh Circuit’s application of its definition is nonsensical.  See 85 F. 4th, at&nbsp;1222 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (“The AR–15 is a civilian, not military, weapon.  No army in the world uses a service rifle that is only semiautomatic”).  In my view, Illinois’ ban is “highly suspect because it broadly prohibits common semiautomatic firearms used for lawful purposes.”  <em>Friedman</em>, 577 U.&nbsp;S., at 1042 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas, J.</span>).  It is difficult to see how the Seventh Circuit could have concluded that the most widely owned semiautomatic rifles are not “Arms” protected by the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution second Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment\">Second Amendment</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> These petitions arise from a preliminary injunction, and &nbsp;the Seventh Circuit stressed that its merits analysis was merely “a preliminary look at the subject.”  85 F.&nbsp;4th, at 1197.  But, if the Seventh Circuit ultimately allows Illinois to ban America’s most common civilian rifle, we can—and should—review that decision once the cases reach a final judgment.  The Court must not permit “the Seventh Circuit [to] relegat[e] the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution second Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment\">Second Amendment</a> to a second-class right.”  <em>Friedman</em>, 577 U.&nbsp;S., at 1043 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas, J.</span>).</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tab-pane\" id=\"tab_default_2\">\n<!-- 'notes' content area -->\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

The States’ laws differ in the entities they cover and the activities they limit.  But both curtail the platforms’ capacity to engage in content moderation—to filter, prioritize, and label the varied third-party messages, videos, and other content their users wish to post.  Both laws also include individualized-explanation provisions, requiring a platform to give reasons to a user if it removes or alters her posts.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-d jy-both indent_l-187 indent_h-187\">  NetChoice LLC and the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association (collectively, NetChoice)—trade associations whose members include Facebook and YouTube—brought facial <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> challenges against the two laws.  District courts in both States entered preliminary injunctions.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-d jy-both indent_l-187 indent_h-187\">  The Eleventh Circuit upheld the injunction of Florida’s law, as to all provisions relevant here.  The court held that the State’s restrictions on content moderation trigger <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> scrutiny under this Court’s cases protecting “editorial discretion.”  34 F. 4th 1196, 1209, 1216.  The court then concluded that the content-moderation provisions are unlikely to survive heightened scrutiny.  <em>Id</em>., at 1227–1228.  Similarly, the Eleventh Circuit thought the statute’s individualized-explanation requirements likely to fall.  Relying on <em>Zauderer</em> v. <em>Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio</em>, <a aria-label=\"471 U. S. 626\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/471/626\">471 U.&nbsp;S. 626</a>, the &nbsp;court held that the obligation to explain “millions of [decisions] per day” is “unduly burdensome and likely to chill platforms’ protected speech.”  34 F. 4th, at 1230.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-d jy-both indent_l-187 indent_h-187\">  The Fifth Circuit disagreed across the board, and so reversed the preliminary injunction of the Texas law.  In that court’s view, the platforms’ content-moderation activities are “not speech” at all, and so do not implicate the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>.  49 F. 4th 439, 466, 494.  But even if those activities were expressive, the court determined the State could regulate them to advance its interest in “protecting a diversity of ideas.”  <em>Id</em>., at 482.  The court further held that the statute’s individualized-explanation provisions would likely survive, even assuming the platforms were engaged in speech.  It found no undue burden under <em>Zauderer</em> because the platforms needed only to “scale up” a “complaint-and-appeal process” they already used<em>.</em>  49 F.&nbsp;4th, at 487.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-e jy-both\"><em>Held</em>:&nbsp;The judgments are vacated, and the cases are remanded, because neither the Eleventh Circuit nor the Fifth Circuit conducted a proper analysis of the facial <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> challenges to Florida and Texas laws regulating large internet platforms.  Pp. 9–31.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> (a)&nbsp;NetChoice’s decision to litigate these cases as facial challenges comes at a cost.  The Court has made facial challenges hard to win.  In the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> context, a plaintiff must show that “a substantial number of [the law’s] applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute’s plainly legitimate sweep.”  <em>Americans for Prosperity Foundation</em> v. <em>Bonta</em>, <a aria-label=\"594 U. S. 595\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/594/595\">594 U.&nbsp;S. 595</a>, 615.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> So far in these cases, no one has paid much attention to that issue.  Analysis and arguments below focused mainly on how the laws applied to the content-moderation practices that giant social-media platforms use on their best-known services to filter, alter, or label their users’ posts, <em>i.e.</em>, on how the laws applied to the likes of Facebook’s News Feed and YouTube’s homepage.  They did not address the full range of activities the laws cover, and measure the constitutional against the unconstitutional applications.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> The proper analysis begins with an assessment of the state laws’ scope.  The laws appear to apply beyond Facebook’s News Feed and its ilk.  But it’s not clear to what extent, if at all, they affect social-media giants’ other services, like direct messaging, or what they have to say about other platforms and functions.  And before a court can do anything else with these facial challenges, it must “determine what [the law] covers.”  <em>United States </em>v.<em> Hansen</em>, <a aria-label=\"599 U. S. 762\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/599/762\">599 U.&nbsp;S. 762</a>, 770.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> The next order of business is to decide which of the laws’ applications violate the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>, and to measure them against the rest.  For the content-moderation provisions, that means asking, as to every covered platform or function, whether there is an intrusion on protected editorial discretion.  And for the individualized-explanation provisions, it means asking, again as to each thing covered, whether the required disclosures unduly burden expression.  See <em>Zauderer</em>, 471 U.&nbsp;S., at 651.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> Because this is “a court of review, not of first view,” <em>Cutter</em> v. <em>Wilkinson</em>, <a aria-label=\"544 U. S. 709\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/544/709\">544 U.&nbsp;S. 709</a>, 718, n.&nbsp;7, this Court cannot undertake the needed inquiries.  And because neither the Eleventh nor the Fifth Circuit performed the facial analysis in the way described above, their decisions must be vacated and the cases remanded.  Pp. 9–12.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> (b)&nbsp;It is necessary to say more about how the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> relates to the laws’ content-moderation provisions, to ensure that the facial analysis proceeds on the right path in the courts below.  That need is especially stark for the Fifth Circuit, whose decision rested on a serious misunderstanding of <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> precedent and principle.  Pp. 12–29.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\">  (1)&nbsp;The Court has repeatedly held that ordering a party to provide a forum for someone else’s views implicates the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> if, though only if, the regulated party is engaged in its own expressive activity, which the mandated access would alter or disrupt.  First, in <em>Miami Herald Publishing Co.</em> v. <em>Tornillo</em>, <a aria-label=\"418 U. S. 241\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/418/241\">418 U.&nbsp;S. 241</a>, the Court held that a Florida law requiring a newspaper to give a political candidate a right to reply to critical coverage interfered with the newspaper’s “exercise of editorial control and judgment.”  <em>Id.,</em> at 243, 258.  Florida could not, the Court explained, override the newspaper’s decisions about the “content of the paper” and “[t]he choice of material to go into” it, because that would substitute “governmental regulation” for the “crucial process” of editorial choice.  <em>Id.,</em> at 258.<em> </em>The next case, <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co.</em> v. <em>Public Util. Comm’n of Cal.</em>, <a aria-label=\"475 U. S. 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/475/1\">475 U.&nbsp;S. 1</a>, involved California’s attempt to force a private utility to include material from a certain consumer-advocacy group in its regular newsletter to consumers.  The Court held that an interest in “offer[ing] the public a greater variety of views” could not justify compelling the utility “to carry speech with which it disagreed” and thus to “alter its own message.”  <em>Id.,</em> at 11, n.&nbsp;7, 12, 16.  Then in <em>Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, <a aria-label=\"512 U. S. 622\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/512/622\">512 U.&nbsp;S. 622</a>, the Court considered federal “must-carry” rules, which required cable operators to allocate certain channels to local broadcast stations.  The Court had no doubt the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> was implicated, because the rules “interfere[d]” with the cable operators’ “editorial discretion over which stations or programs to include in [their] repertoire.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 636, 643–644.  The capstone of this line of precedents, <em>Hurley</em> v. <em>Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"515 U. S. 557\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/515/557\">515 U.&nbsp;S. 557</a>, held that the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> prevented Massachusetts from compelling parade organizers to admit as a participant a gay and lesbian group seeking to convey a message of “pride.”  <em>Id.,</em> at 561.  It held that ordering the group’s admittance would “alter the expressive content of the[&nbsp;] parade,” and that the decision to exclude the group’s message was the organizers’ alone.  <em>Id.</em>, at 572–574.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> From that slew of individual cases, three general points emerge.  First, the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> offers protection when an entity engaged in compiling and curating others’ speech into an expressive product of its own is directed to accommodate messages it would prefer to exclude.  Second, none of that changes just because a compiler includes most items and excludes just a few.  It “is enough” for the compiler to exclude the handful of messages it most “disfavor[s].”  <em>Hurley</em>, 515 U.&nbsp;S., at 574.  Third, the government cannot get its way just by asserting an interest in better balancing the marketplace of ideas.  In case after case, the Court has barred the government from forcing a private speaker to present views it wished to spurn in order to rejigger the expressive realm.  Pp. 13–19.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\">  (2)&nbsp;“[W]hatever the challenges of applying the Constitution to ever-advancing technology, the basic principles” of the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> “do not vary.”  <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Entertainment Merchants Assn.</em>, <a aria-label=\"564 U. S. 786\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/564/786\">564 U.&nbsp;S. 786</a>, 790.  And the principles elaborated in the above-summarized decisions establish that Texas is not likely to succeed in enforcing its law against the platforms’ application of their content-moderation policies to their main feeds.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> Facebook’s News Feed and YouTube’s homepage present users with a continually updating, personalized stream of other users’ posts.  The key to the scheme is prioritization of content, achieved through algorithms.  The selection and ranking is most often based on a user’s expressed interests and past activities, but it may also be based on other factors, including the platform’s preferences.  Facebook’s Community Standards and YouTube’s Community Guidelines detail the messages and videos that the platforms disfavor.  The platforms write algorithms to implement those standards—for example, to prefer content deemed particularly trustworthy or to suppress content viewed as deceptive.  Beyond ranking content, platforms may add labels, to give users additional context.  And they also remove posts entirely that contain prohibited subjects or messages, such as pornography, hate speech, and misinformation on certain topics.  The platforms thus unabashedly control the content that will appear to users.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> Texas’s law, though, limits their power to do so.  Its central provision prohibits covered platforms from “censor[ing]” a “user’s expression” based on the “viewpoint” it contains.  Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. §143A.002(a)(2).  The platforms thus cannot do any of the things they typically do (on their main feeds) to posts they disapprove—cannot demote, label, or remove them—whenever the action is based on the post’s viewpoint.  That limitation profoundly alters the platforms’ choices about the views they convey.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> The Court has repeatedly held that type of regulation to interfere with protected speech.  Like the editors, cable operators, and parade organizers this Court has previously considered, the major social-media platforms curate their feeds by combining “multifarious voices” to create a distinctive expressive offering.  <em>Hurley</em>, 515 U.&nbsp;S., at 569.  Their choices about which messages are appropriate give the feed a particular expressive quality and “constitute the exercise” of protected “editorial control.”  <em>Tornillo</em>, 418 U.&nbsp;S., at 258.  And the Texas law targets those expressive choices by forcing the platforms to present and promote content on their feeds that they regard as objectionable.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> That those platforms happily convey the lion’s share of posts submitted to them makes no significant <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> difference.  In <em>Hurley</em>, the Court held that the parade organizers’ “lenient” admissions policy did “not forfeit” their right to reject the few messages they found harmful or offensive.  515 U.&nbsp;S., at 569.  Similarly here, that Facebook and YouTube convey a mass of messages does not license Texas to prohibit them from deleting posts they disfavor.  Pp. 19–26.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\">  (3)&nbsp;The interest Texas relies on cannot sustain its law.  In the usual <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> case, the Court must decide whether to apply strict or intermediate scrutiny.  But here, Texas’s law does not pass even the less stringent form of review.  Under that standard, a law must further a “substantial governmental interest” that is “unrelated to the suppression of free expression.”  <em>United States</em> v. <em>O’Brien</em>, <a aria-label=\"391 U. S. 367\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/391/367\">391 U.&nbsp;S. 367</a>, 377.  Many possible interests relating to social media can meet that test.  But Texas’s asserted interest relates to the suppression of free expression, and it is not valid, let alone substantial.</p>\n<p class=\"sylct-f jy-both indent_l-187\"> Texas has never been shy, and always been consistent, about its interest: The objective is to correct the mix of viewpoints that major platforms present.  But a State may not interfere with private actors’ speech to advance its own vision of ideological balance.  States (and their citizens) are of course right to want an expressive realm in which the public has access to a wide range of views.  But the way the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> achieves that goal is by preventing <em>the government </em>from “tilt[ing] public debate in a preferred direction,” <em>Sorrell</em> v. <em>IMS Health Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"564 U. S. 552\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/564/552\">564 U.&nbsp;S. 552</a>, 578–579, not by licensing the government to stop <em>private actors</em> from speaking as they wish and preferring some views over others.  A State cannot prohibit speech to rebalance the speech market.  That unadorned interest is not “unrelated to the suppression of free expression.”  And Texas may not pursue it consistent with the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>.

S. 844\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/521/844\">521 U.&nbsp;S. 844</a>, 849 (1997).  Things have changed since then.  At the time, only 40 million people used the internet.  See <em>id.</em>, at 850.  Today, Facebook and YouTube alone have over two billion users each.  See App. in No. 22–555, p.&nbsp;67a.  And the public likely no longer needs this Court to define the internet.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; These years have brought a dizzying transformation in how people communicate, and with it a raft of public policy issues.  Social-media platforms, as well as other websites, have gone from unheard-of to inescapable.  They structure how we relate to family and friends, as well as to businesses, civic organizations, and governments.  The novel services they offer make our lives better, and make them worse—create unparalleled opportunities and unprecedented dangers.  The questions of whether, when, and how to regulate online entities, and in particular the social-media giants, are understandably on the front-burner of many legislatures and agencies.  And those government actors will generally be better positioned than courts to respond to the emerging challenges social-media entities pose.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> But courts still have a necessary role in protecting those entities’ rights of speech, as courts have historically protected traditional media’s rights.  To the extent that social-media platforms create expressive products, they receive the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>’s protection.  And although these cases are here in a preliminary posture, the current record suggests that some platforms, in at least some functions, are indeed engaged in expression.  In constructing certain feeds, those platforms make choices about what third-party speech to display and how to display it.  They include and exclude, organize and prioritize—and in making millions of those decisions each day, produce their own distinctive compilations of expression.  And while much about social media is new, the essence of that project is something this Court has seen before.  Traditional publishers and editors also select and shape other parties’ expression into their own curated speech products.  And we have repeatedly held that laws curtailing their editorial choices must meet the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>’s requirements.  The principle does not change because the curated compilation has gone from the physical to the virtual world.  In the latter, as in the former, government efforts to alter an edited compilation of third-party &nbsp;expression are subject to judicial review for compliance with the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Today, we consider whether two state laws regulating social-media platforms and other websites facially violate the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>.  The laws, from Florida and Texas, restrict the ability of social-media platforms to control whether and how third-party posts are presented to other users.  Or otherwise put, the laws limit the platforms’ capacity to engage in content moderation—to filter, prioritize, and label the varied messages, videos, and other content their users wish to post.  In addition, though far less addressed in this Court, the laws require a platform to provide an individualized explanation to a user if it removes or alters her posts.  NetChoice, an internet trade association, challenged both laws on their face—as a whole, rather than as to particular applications.  The cases come to us at an early stage, on review of preliminary injunctions.  The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit upheld such an injunction, finding that the Florida law was not likely to survive <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> review.  The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed a similar injunction, primarily reasoning that the Texas law does not regulate any speech and so does not implicate the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Today, we vacate both decisions for reasons separate from the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> merits, because neither Court of Appeals properly considered the facial nature of NetChoice’s challenge.  The courts mainly addressed what the parties had focused on.  And the parties mainly argued these cases as if the laws applied only to the curated feeds offered by the largest and most paradigmatic social-media platforms—as if, say, each case presented an as-applied challenge brought by Facebook protesting its loss of control over the content of its News Feed.  But argument in this Court revealed that the laws might apply to, and differently affect, other kinds of websites and apps.  In a facial challenge, that could well matter, even when the challenge is &nbsp;brought under the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>.  As explained below, the question in such a case is whether a law’s unconstitutional applications are substantial compared to its constitutional ones.  To make that judgment, a court must determine a law’s full set of applications, evaluate which are constitutional and which are not, and compare the one to the other.  Neither court performed that necessary inquiry.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> To do that right, of course, a court must understand what kind of government actions the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> prohibits.  We therefore set out the relevant constitutional principles, and explain how one of the Courts of Appeals failed to follow them.  Contrary to what the Fifth Circuit thought, the current record indicates that the Texas law does regulate speech when applied in the way the parties focused on below—when applied, that is, to prevent Facebook (or YouTube) from using its content-moderation standards to remove, alter, organize, prioritize, or disclaim posts in its News Feed (or homepage).  The law then prevents exactly the kind of editorial judgments this Court has previously held to receive <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> protection.  It prevents a platform from compiling the third-party speech it wants in the way it wants, and thus from offering the expressive product that most reflects its own views and priorities.  Still more, the law—again, in that specific application—is unlikely to withstand <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> scrutiny.  Texas has thus far justified the law as necessary to balance the mix of speech on Facebook’s News Feed and similar platforms; and the record reflects that Texas officials passed it because they thought those feeds skewed against politically conservative voices.  But this Court has many times held, in many contexts, that it is no job for government to decide what counts as the right balance of private expression—to “un-bias” what it thinks biased, rather than to leave such judgments to speakers and their audiences.  That principle works for social-media platforms as it does for others.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In sum, there is much work to do below on both these &nbsp;cases, given the facial nature of NetChoice’s challenges.  But that work must be done consistent with the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>, which does not go on leave when social media are involved.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">I</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> As commonly understood, the term “social media platforms” typically refers to websites and mobile apps that allow users to upload content—messages, pictures, videos, and so on—to share with others.  Those viewing the content can then react to it, comment on it, or share it themselves.  The biggest social-media companies—entities like Facebook and YouTube—host a staggering amount of content.  Facebook users, for example, share more than 100 billion messages every day.  See App. in No. 22–555, at 67a.  And YouTube sees more than 500 hours of video uploaded every minute.  See <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In the face of that deluge, the major platforms cull and organize uploaded posts in a variety of ways.  A user does not see everything—even everything from the people she follows—in reverse-chronological order.  The platforms will have removed some content entirely; ranked or otherwise prioritized what remains; and sometimes added warnings or labels.  Of particular relevance here, Facebook and YouTube make some of those decisions in conformity with content-moderation policies they call Community Standards and Community Guidelines.  Those rules list the subjects or messages the platform prohibits or discourages—say, pornography, hate speech, or misinformation on select topics.  The rules thus lead Facebook and YouTube to remove, disfavor, or label various posts based on their content.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In 2021, Florida and Texas enacted statutes regulating internet platforms, including the large social-media companies just mentioned.  The States’ laws differ in the entities they cover and the activities they limit.  But both contain &nbsp;content-moderation provisions, restricting covered platforms’ choices about whether and how to display user-&nbsp;generated content to the public.  And both include &nbsp;individualized-explanation provisions, requiring platforms to give reasons for particular content-moderation choices.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Florida’s law regulates “social media platforms,” as defined expansively, that have annual gross revenue of over $100 million or more than 100 million monthly active users.  Fla. Stat. §501.2041(1)(g) (2023).<a aria-label=\"reference 2 of Kagan Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-2\" id=\"OPINION_4-2ref\"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a>  The statute restricts varied ways of “censor[ing]” or otherwise disfavoring posts—including deleting, altering, labeling, or deprioritizing them—based on their content or source.  §501.2041(1)(b).  For example, the law prohibits a platform from taking those actions against “a journalistic enterprise based on the content of its publication or broadcast.”  §501.2041(2)(j).  Similarly, the law prevents deprioritizing posts by or about political candidates.  See §501.2041(2)(h).  And the law requires platforms to apply their content-moderation practices to users “in a consistent manner.”  §501.2041(2)(b).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In addition, the Florida law mandates that a platform provide an explanation to a user any time it removes or alters any of her posts.  See §501.2041(2)(d)(1).  The requisite notice must be delivered within seven days, and contain both a “thorough rationale” for the action and an account of how the platform became aware of the targeted material.  §501.2041(3).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Texas law regulates any social-media platform, having over 50 million monthly active users, that allows its users “to communicate with other users for the primary purpose of posting information, comments, messages, or images.”  Tex. Bus. &amp; Com. Code Ann. §§120.001(1), &nbsp;120.002(b) (West Cum. Supp. 2023).<a aria-label=\"reference 3 of Kagan Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-3\" id=\"OPINION_4-3ref\"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></a>  With several exceptions, the statute prevents platforms from “censor[ing]” a user or a user’s expression based on viewpoint.  Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. §§143A.002(a), 143A.006 (West Cum. Supp. 2023).  That ban on “censor[ing]” covers any action to “block, ban, remove, deplatform, demonetize, de-boost, restrict, deny equal access or visibility to, or otherwise discriminate against expression.”  §143A.001(1).  The statute also requires that “concurrently with the removal” of user content, the platform shall “notify the user” and “explain the reason the content was removed.”  §120.103(a)(1).  The user gets a right of appeal, and the platform must address an appeal within 14 days.  See §§120.103(a)(2), 120.104.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Soon after Florida and Texas enacted those statutes, NetChoice LLC and the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association (collectively, NetChoice)—trade associations whose members include Facebook and YouTube—brought facial <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> challenges against the two laws.  District courts in both States entered preliminary injunctions, halting the laws’ enforcement.  See 546 F.&nbsp;Supp. 3d 1082, 1096 (ND Fla. 2021); 573 F.&nbsp;Supp. 3d 1092, 1117 (WD Tex. 2021).  Each court held that the suit before it is likely to succeed because the statute infringes on the constitutionally protected “editorial judgment” of NetChoice’s members about what material they will display.  See 546 F.&nbsp;Supp. 3d, at 1090; 573 F.&nbsp;Supp. 3d, at 1107.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Eleventh Circuit upheld the injunction of Florida’s law, as to all provisions relevant here.  The court held that the State’s restrictions on content moderation trigger <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> scrutiny under this Court’s cases protecting &nbsp;“editorial discretion.”  34 F.&nbsp;4th 1196, 1209, 1216 (2022).  When a social-media platform “removes or deprioritizes a user or post,” the court explained, it makes a “judgment rooted in the platform’s own views about the sorts of content and viewpoints that are valuable and appropriate for dissemination.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 1210.  The court concluded that the content-moderation provisions are unlikely to survive “intermediate—let alone strict—scrutiny,” because a State has no legitimate interest in counteracting “private ‘censorship’&nbsp;” by “tilt[ing] public debate in a preferred direction.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 1227–1228.  Similarly, the Eleventh Circuit thought the statute’s individualized-explanation requirements likely to fall.  Applying the standard from <em>Zauderer</em> v. <em>Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio</em>, <a aria-label=\"471 U.S. 626\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/471/626\">471 U.&nbsp;S. 626 (1985)</a>, the court held that the obligation to explain “millions of [decisions] per day” is “unduly burdensome and likely to chill platforms’ protected speech.”  34 F.&nbsp;4th, at 1230.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Fifth Circuit disagreed across the board, and so reversed the preliminary injunction before it.  In that court’s view, the platforms’ content-moderation activities are “not speech” at all, and so do not implicate the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>.  49 F.&nbsp;4th 439, 466, 494 (2022).  But even if those activities were expressive, the court continued, the State could regulate them to advance its interest in “protecting a diversity of ideas.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 482 (emphasis deleted).  The court further held that the statute’s individualized-&nbsp;explanation provisions would likely survive, again even assuming that the platforms were engaged in speech.  Those requirements, the court maintained, are not unduly burdensome under <em>Zauderer </em>because the platforms needed only to “scale up” a “complaint-and-appeal process” they already used.  49 F.&nbsp;4th, at 487.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> We granted certiorari to resolve the split between the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits.  600 U.&nbsp;S. ___ (2023).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">&nbsp;II</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> NetChoice chose to litigate these cases as facial challenges, and that decision comes at a cost.  For a host of good reasons, courts usually handle constitutional claims case by case, not en masse.  See <em>Washington State Grange</em> v. <em>Washington State Republican Party</em>, <a aria-label=\"552 U. S. 442\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/552/442\">552 U.&nbsp;S. 442</a>, 450–451 (2008).  “Claims of facial invalidity often rest on speculation” about the law’s coverage and its future enforcement.  <em>Id.</em>, at 450.  And “facial challenges threaten to short circuit the democratic process” by preventing duly enacted laws from being implemented in constitutional ways.  <em>Id.</em>, at 451.  This Court has therefore made facial challenges hard to win.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> That is true even when a facial suit is based on the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>, although then a different standard applies.  In other cases, a plaintiff cannot succeed on a facial challenge unless he “establish[es] that no set of circumstances exists under which the [law] would be valid,” or he shows that the law lacks a “plainly legitimate sweep.”  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Salerno</em>, <a aria-label=\"481 U. S. 739\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/481/739\">481 U.&nbsp;S. 739</a>, 745 (1987); <em>Washington State Grange</em>, 552 U.&nbsp;S., at 449.  In <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> cases, however, this Court has lowered that very high bar.  To “provide[&nbsp;] breathing room for free expression,” we have substituted a less demanding though still rigorous standard.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Hansen</em>, <a aria-label=\"599 U. S. 762\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/599/762\">599 U.&nbsp;S. 762</a>, 769 (2023).  The question is whether “a substantial number of [the law’s] applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute’s plainly legitimate sweep.”  <em>Americans for Prosperity Foundation</em> v. <em>Bonta</em>, <a aria-label=\"594 U. S. 595\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/594/595\">594 U.&nbsp;S. 595</a>, 615 (2021); see <em>Hansen</em>, 599 U.&nbsp;S., at 770 (likewise asking whether the law “prohibits a substantial amount of protected speech relative to its plainly legitimate sweep”).  So in this singular context, even a law with “a plainly legitimate sweep” may be struck down in its entirety.  But that is so only if the law’s unconstitutional applications substantially outweigh its constitutional ones.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> So far in these cases, no one has paid much attention to &nbsp;that issue.  In the lower courts, NetChoice and the States alike treated the laws as having certain heartland applications, and mostly confined their battle to that terrain.  More specifically, the focus was on how the laws applied to the content-moderation practices that giant social-media platforms use on their best-known services to filter, alter, or label their users’ posts.  Or more specifically still, the focus was on how the laws applied to Facebook’s News Feed and YouTube’s homepage.  Reflecting the parties’ arguments, the Eleventh and Fifth Circuits also mostly confined their analysis in that way.  See 34 F.&nbsp;4th, at 1210, 1213 (considering “platforms like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok” and content moderation in “viewers’ feeds”); 49 F.&nbsp;4th, at 445, 460, 478, 492 (considering platforms “such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube” and referencing users’ feeds); see also <em>id.</em>, at 501 (Southwick, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (analyzing a curated feed).  On their way to opposing conclusions, they concentrated on the same issue: whether a state law can regulate the content-moderation practices used in Facebook’s News Feed (or near equivalents).  They did not address the full range of activities the laws cover, and measure the constitutional against the unconstitutional applications.  In short, they treated these cases more like as-applied claims than like facial ones.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The first step in the proper facial analysis is to assess the state laws’ scope.  What activities, by what actors, do the laws prohibit or otherwise regulate?  The laws of course differ one from the other.  But both, at least on their face, appear to apply beyond Facebook’s News Feed and its ilk.  Members of this Court asked some of the relevant questions at oral argument.  Starting with Facebook and the other giants: To what extent, if at all, do the laws affect their other services, like direct messaging or events management?  See Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 22–555, pp.&nbsp;62–63; Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 22–277, pp.&nbsp;24–25; App. in No. 22–277, pp.&nbsp;129, 159.  And beyond those social-media entities, what &nbsp;do the laws have to say, if anything, about how an email provider like Gmail filters incoming messages, how an online marketplace like Etsy displays customer reviews, how a payment service like Venmo manages friends’ financial exchanges, or how a ride-sharing service like Uber runs?  See Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 22–277, at 74–79, 95–98; see also <em>id.</em>, at 153 (Solicitor General) (“I have some sympathy [for the Court] here.  In preparation for this argument, I’ve been working with my team to say, does this even cover direct messaging?  Does this even cover Gmail?”).  Those are examples only.  The online world is variegated and complex, encompassing an ever-growing number of apps, services, functionalities, and methods for communication and connection.  Each might (or might not) have to change because of the provisions, as to either content moderation or individualized explanation, in Florida’s or Texas’s law.  Before a court can do anything else with these facial challenges, it must address that set of issues—in short, must “determine what [the law] covers.”  <em>Hansen</em>, 599 U.&nbsp;S., at 770.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The next order of business is to decide which of the laws’ applications violate the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>, and to measure them against the rest.  For the content-moderation provisions, that means asking, as to every covered platform or function, whether there is an intrusion on protected &nbsp;editorial discretion.  See <em>infra</em>, at 13–19.  And for the &nbsp;individualized-explanation provisions, it means asking, again as to each thing covered, whether the required disclosures unduly burden expression.  See <em>Zauderer</em>, 471 U.&nbsp;S., at 651. Even on a preliminary record, it is not hard to see how the answers might differ as between regulation of Facebook’s News Feed (considered in the courts below) and, say, its direct messaging service (not so considered).  Curating a feed and transmitting direct messages, one might think, involve different levels of editorial choice, so that the one creates an expressive product and the other does not.  &nbsp;If so, regulation of those diverse activities could well fall on different sides of the constitutional line.  To decide the facial challenges here, the courts below must explore the laws’ full range of applications—the constitutionally impermissible and permissible both—and compare the two sets.  Maybe the parties treated the content-moderation choices reflected in Facebook’s News Feed and YouTube’s homepage as the laws’ heartland applications because they <em>are</em> the principal things regulated, and should have just that weight in the facial analysis.  Or maybe not: Maybe the parties’ focus had all to do with litigation strategy, and there is a sphere of other applications—and constitutional ones—that would prevent the laws’ facial invalidation.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The problem for this Court is that it cannot undertake the needed inquiries.  “[W]e are a court of review, not of first view.”  <em>Cutter</em> v. <em>Wilkinson</em>, <a aria-label=\"544 U. S. 709\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/544/709\">544 U.&nbsp;S. 709</a>, 718, n.&nbsp;7 (2005).  Neither the Eleventh Circuit nor the Fifth Circuit performed the facial analysis in the way just described.  And even were we to ignore the value of other courts going first, we could not proceed very far.  The parties have not briefed the critical issues here, and the record is underdeveloped.  So we vacate the decisions below and remand these cases.  That will enable the lower courts to consider the scope of the laws’ applications, and weigh the unconstitutional as against the constitutional ones.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">III</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> But it is necessary to say more about how the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> relates to the laws’ content-moderation provisions, to ensure that the facial analysis proceeds on the right path in the courts below.  That need is especially stark for the Fifth Circuit.  Recall that it held that the content choices the major platforms make for their main feeds are “not speech” at all, so States may regulate them free of the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>’s restraints.  49 F.&nbsp;4th, at 494; see <em>supra</em>, at 8.  And even if those activities were expressive, the court &nbsp;held, Texas’s interest in better balancing the marketplace of ideas would satisfy <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> scrutiny.  See 49 F.&nbsp;4th, at 482.  If we said nothing about those views, the court presumably would repeat them when it next considers NetChoice’s challenge.  It would thus find that significant applications of the Texas law—and so significant inputs into the appropriate facial analysis—raise no <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> difficulties.  But that conclusion would rest on a serious misunderstanding of <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> precedent and principle.  The Fifth Circuit was wrong in concluding that Texas’s restrictions on the platforms’ selection, ordering, and labeling of third-party posts do not interfere with expression.  And the court was wrong to treat as valid Texas’s interest in changing the content of the platforms’ feeds.  Explaining why that is so will prevent the Fifth Circuit from repeating its errors as to Facebook’s and YouTube’s main feeds.  (And our analysis of Texas’s law may also aid the Eleventh Circuit, which saw the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> issues much as we do, when next considering NetChoice’s facial challenge.)  But a caveat: Nothing said here addresses any of the laws’ other applications, which may or may not share the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> problems described below.<a aria-label=\"reference 4 of Kagan Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-4\" id=\"OPINION_4-4ref\"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">A</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Despite the relative novelty of the technology before us, the main problem in this case—and the inquiry it calls for—is not new.  At bottom, Texas’s law requires the platforms to carry and promote user speech that they would rather &nbsp;discard or downplay.  The platforms object that the law thus forces them to alter the content of their expression—a particular edited compilation of third-party speech.  See Brief for NetChoice in No. 22–555, pp.&nbsp;18–34.  That controversy sounds a familiar note.  We have repeatedly faced the question whether ordering a party to provide a forum for someone else’s views implicates the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>.  And we have repeatedly held that it does so if, though only if, the regulated party is engaged in its own expressive activity, which the mandated access would alter or disrupt.  So too we have held, when applying that principle, that expressive activity includes presenting a curated compilation of speech originally created by others.  A review of the relevant precedents will help resolve the question here.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The seminal case is <em>Miami Herald Publishing Co.</em> v. <em>Tornillo</em>, <a aria-label=\"418 U.S. 241\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/418/241\">418 U.&nbsp;S. 241 (1974)</a>.  There, a Florida law required a newspaper to give a political candidate a right to reply when it published “criticism and attacks on his record.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 243.  The Court held the law to violate the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> because it interfered with the newspaper’s “exercise of editorial control and judgment.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 258.  Forcing the paper to print what “it would not otherwise print,” the Court explained, “intru[ded] into the function of editors.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 256, 258.  For that function was, first and foremost, to make decisions about the “content of the paper” and “[t]he choice of material to go into” it.  <em>Id.</em>, at 258.  In protecting that right of editorial control, the Court recognized a possible downside.  It noted the access advocates’ view (similar to the States’ view here) that “modern media empires” had gained ever greater capacity to “shape” and even “manipulate popular opinion.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 249–250.  And the Court expressed some sympathy with that diagnosis.  See <em>id.</em>, at 254.  But the cure proposed, it concluded, collided with the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>’s antipathy to <em>state </em>manipulation of the speech market.  Florida, the Court explained, &nbsp;could not substitute “governmental regulation” for the “crucial process” of editorial choice.  <em>Id.</em>, at 258.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Next up was <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co.</em> v. <em>Public Util. Comm’n of Cal.</em>, <a aria-label=\"475 U.S. 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/475/1\">475 U.&nbsp;S. 1 (1986)</a> (<em>PG&amp;E</em>), which the Court thought to follow naturally from <em>Tornillo</em>.  See 475 U.&nbsp;S., at 9–12 (plurality opinion); <em>id.</em>, at 21 (Burger, C.&nbsp;J., concurring).  A private utility in California regularly put a newsletter in its billing envelopes expressing its views of energy policy.  The State directed it to include as well material from a consumer-advocacy group giving a different perspective.  The utility objected, and the Court held again that the interest in “offer[ing] the public a greater variety of views” could not justify the regulation.  <em>Id.</em>, at 12.  California was compelling the utility (as Florida had compelled a newspaper) “to carry speech with which it disagreed” and thus to “alter its own message.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 11, n.&nbsp;7, 16.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"><em> </em>In <em>Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, <a aria-label=\"512 U.S. 622\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/512/622\">512 U.&nbsp;S. 622 (1994)</a> (<em>Turner I&nbsp;</em>), the Court further underscored the constitutional protection given to editorial choice.  At issue were federal “must-carry” rules, requiring cable operators to allocate some of their channels to local broadcast stations.  The Court had no doubt that the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> was implicated, because the operators were engaging in expressive activity.  They were, the Court explained, “exercising editorial discretion over which stations or programs to include in [their] repertoire.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 636.  And the rules “interfere[d]” with that discretion by forcing the operators to carry stations they would not otherwise have chosen.  <em>Id.</em>, at 643–644.  In a later decision, the Court ruled that the regulation survived <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> review because it was necessary to prevent the demise of local broadcasting.  See <em>Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, <a aria-label=\"520 U. S. 180\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/520/180\">520 U.&nbsp;S. 180</a>, 185, 189–190 (1997) (<em>Turner II&nbsp;</em>); see <em>infra</em>, at 28, n.&nbsp;10.  But for purposes of today’s cases, the takeaway of <em>Turner </em>is this holding: A private party’s collection of third-party content into a single speech product (the operators’ “repertoire” &nbsp;of programming) is itself expressive, and intrusion into that activity must be specially justified under the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The capstone of those precedents came in <em>Hurley</em> v. <em>Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"515 U.S. 557\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/515/557\">515 U.&nbsp;S. 557 (1995)</a>, when the Court considered (of all things) a parade.  The question was whether Massachusetts could require the organizers of a St. Patrick’s Day parade to admit as a participant a gay and lesbian group seeking to convey a message of “pride.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 561.  The Court held unanimously that the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> precluded that compulsion.  The “selection of contingents to make a parade,” it explained, is entitled to <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> protection, no less than a newspaper’s “presentation of an edited compilation of [other persons’] speech.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 570 (citing <em>Tornillo</em>, 418 U.&nbsp;S., at 258).  And that meant the State could not tell the parade organizers whom to include.  Because “every participating unit affects the message,” said the Court, ordering the group’s admittance would “alter the expressive content of the[&nbsp;] parade.”  <em>Hurley</em>, 515 U.&nbsp;S., at 572–573.  The parade’s organizers had “decided to exclude a message [they] did not like from the communication [they] chose to make,” and that was their decision alone.  <em>Id.</em>, at 574.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> On two other occasions, the Court distinguished <em>Tornillo </em>and its progeny for the flip-side reason—because in those cases the compelled access did <em>not</em> affect the complaining party’s own expression.  First, in <em>PruneYard Shopping Center</em> v. <em>Robins</em>, <a aria-label=\"447 U.S. 74\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/447/74\">447 U.&nbsp;S. 74 (1980)</a>, the Court rejected a shopping mall’s <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> challenge to a California law requiring it to allow members of the public to distribute handbills on its property.  The mall owner did not claim that he (or the mall) was engaged in any expressive activity.  Indeed, as the <em>PG&amp;E </em>Court later noted, he “did not even allege that he objected to the content of the pamphlets” passed out at the mall.  475 U.&nbsp;S., at 12.  Similarly, in <em>Rumsfeld</em> v. <em>Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"547 U.S. 47\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/547/47\">547 U.&nbsp;S. 47 (2006)</a> (<em>FAIR</em>), the Court reiterated that a <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> claim will not succeed when the entity objecting to hosting third-party speech is not itself engaged in expression.  The statute at issue required law schools to allow the military to participate in on-campus recruiting.  The Court held that the schools had no <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> right to exclude the military based on its hiring policies, because the schools “are not speaking when they host interviews.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 64.  Or stated again, with reference to the just-described precedents: Because a “law school’s recruiting services lack the expressive quality of a parade, a newsletter, or the editorial page of a newspaper,” the required “accommodation of a military recruiter[&nbsp;]” did not “interfere with any message of the school.”  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> That is a slew of individual cases, so consider three general points to wrap up.  Not coincidentally, they will figure in the upcoming discussion of the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> problems the statutes at issue here likely present as to Facebook’s News Feed and similar products.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> First, the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> offers protection when an entity engaging in expressive activity, including compiling and curating others’ speech, is directed to accommodate messages it would prefer to exclude.  “[T]he editorial function itself is an aspect of speech.”  <em>Denver Area Ed. Telecommunications Consortium, Inc.</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, <a aria-label=\"518 U. S. 727\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/518/727\">518 U.&nbsp;S. 727</a>, 737 (1996) (plurality opinion).  Or said just a bit differently: An entity “exercis[ing] editorial discretion in the selection and presentation” of content is “engage[d] in speech activity.”  <em>Arkansas Ed. Television Comm’n</em> v. <em>Forbes</em>, <a aria-label=\"523 U. S. 666\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/523/666\">523 U.&nbsp;S. 666</a>, 674 (1998).  And that is as true when the content comes from third parties as when it does not.  (Again, think of a newspaper opinion page or, if you prefer, a parade.)  Deciding on the third-party speech that will be included in or excluded from a compilation—and then organizing and presenting the included items—is expressive activity of its &nbsp;own.  And that activity results in a distinctive expressive product.  When the government interferes with such editorial choices—say, by ordering the excluded to be included—it alters the content of the compilation.  (It creates a different opinion page or parade, bearing a different message.)  And in so doing—in overriding a private party’s expressive choices—the government confronts the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>.<a aria-label=\"reference 5 of Kagan Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-5\" id=\"OPINION_4-5ref\"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Second, none of that changes just because a compiler includes most items and excludes just a few.  That was the situation in <em>Hurley</em>.  The St. Patrick’s Day parade at issue there was “eclectic”: It included a “wide variety of patriotic, commercial, political, moral, artistic, religious, athletic, public service, trade union, and eleemosynary themes, as well as conflicting messages.”  515 U.&nbsp;S., at 562.  Or otherwise said, the organizers were “rather lenient in admitting participants.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 569.  No matter.  A “narrow, succinctly articulable message is not a condition of constitutional protection.”  <em>Ibid.  </em>It “is enough” for a compiler to exclude the handful of messages it most “disfavor[s].”  <em>Id.</em>, at 574.  Suppose, for example, that the newspaper in <em>Tornillo </em>had granted a right of reply to all but one candidate.  It would have made no difference; the Florida statute still could not have altered the paper’s policy.  Indeed, that kind of focused editorial choice packs a peculiarly powerful expressive punch.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Third, the government cannot get its way just by asserting an interest in improving, or better balancing, the marketplace of ideas.  Of course, it is<em> </em>critically important to have a well-functioning sphere of expression, in which citizens have access to information from many sources.  That &nbsp;is the whole project of the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>.  And the government can take varied measures, like enforcing competition laws, to protect that access.  Cf., <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Turner I</em>, 512 U.&nbsp;S., at 647 (protecting local broadcasting); <em>Hurley</em>, 515 U.&nbsp;S., at 577 (discussing <em>Turner I&nbsp;</em>).<em> </em>But in case after case, the Court has barred the government from forcing a private speaker to present views it wished to spurn in order to rejigger the expressive realm.  The regulations in <em>Tornillo</em>,<em> PG&amp;E</em>, and<em> Hurley </em>all were thought to promote greater diversity of expression.  See <em>supra</em>, at 14–16.  They also were thought to counteract advantages some private parties possessed in controlling “enviable vehicle[s]” for speech.  <em>Hurley</em>, 515 U.&nbsp;S., at 577.  Indeed, the <em>Tornillo </em>Court devoted six pages of its opinion to recounting a critique of the then-current media environment—in particular, the disproportionate “influen[ce]” of a few speakers—similar to one heard today (except about different entities).  418 U.&nbsp;S., at 249; see <em>id.</em>, at 248–254; <em>supra</em>, at 14–15.  It made no difference.  However imperfect the private marketplace of ideas, here was a worse proposal—the government itself deciding when speech was imbalanced, and then coercing speakers to provide more of some views or less of others.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> “[W]hatever the challenges of applying the Constitution to ever-advancing technology, the basic principles” of the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> “do not vary.”  <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Entertainment Merchants Assn.</em>, <a aria-label=\"564 U. S. 786\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/564/786\">564 U.&nbsp;S. 786</a>, 790 (2011).  New communications media differ from old ones in a host of ways: No one thinks Facebook’s News Feed much resembles an insert put in a billing envelope.  And similarly, today’s social media pose dangers not seen earlier: No one ever feared the effects of newspaper opinion pages on adolescents’ mental health.  But analogies to old media, even if imperfect, can be useful.  And better still as guides to decision are settled principles about freedom of expression, including the ones &nbsp;just described.  Those principles have served the Nation well over many years, even as one communications method has given way to another.  And they have much to say about the laws at issue here.  These cases, to be sure, are at an early stage; the record is incomplete even as to the major social-media platforms’ main feeds, much less the other applications that must now be considered.  See <em>supra</em>, at 12.  But in reviewing the District Court’s preliminary injunction, the Fifth Circuit got its likelihood-of-success finding wrong.  Texas is not likely to succeed in enforcing its law against the platforms’ application of their content-moderation policies to the feeds that were the focus of the proceedings below.  And that is because of the core teaching elaborated in the above-summarized decisions: The government may not, in supposed pursuit of better expressive balance, alter a private speaker’s own editorial choices about the mix of speech it wants to convey.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Most readers are likely familiar with Facebook’s News Feed or YouTube’s homepage; assuming so, feel free to skip this paragraph (and maybe a couple more).  For the uninitiated, though, each of those feeds presents a user with a continually updating stream of other users’ posts.  For Facebook’s News Feed, any user may upload a message, whether verbal or visual, with content running the gamut from “vacation pictures from friends” to “articles from local or national news outlets.”  App. in No. 22–555, at 139a.  And whenever a user signs on, Facebook delivers a personalized collection of those stories.  Similarly for YouTube.  Its users upload all manner of videos.  And any person opening the website or mobile app receives an individualized list of video recommendations.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The key to the scheme is prioritization of content, achieved through the use of algorithms.  Of the billions of posts or videos (plus advertisements) that could wind up on a user’s customized feed or recommendations list, only the tiniest fraction do.  The selection and ranking is most often &nbsp;based on a user’s expressed interests and past activities.  But it may also be based on more general features of the communication or its creator.  Facebook’s Community Standards and YouTube’s Community Guidelines detail the messages and videos that the platforms disfavor.  The platforms write algorithms to implement those standards—for example, to prefer content deemed particularly trustworthy or to suppress content viewed as deceptive (like videos promoting “conspiracy theor[ies]”).  <em>Id.</em>, at 113a.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Beyond rankings lie labels.  The platforms may attach “warning[s], disclaimers, or general commentary”—for example, informing users that certain content has “not been verified by official sources.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 75a.  Likewise, they may use “information panels” to give users “context on content relating to topics and news prone to misinformation, as well as context about who submitted the content.”  <em>Id.</em>, at 114a.  So, for example, YouTube identifies content submitted by state-supported media channels, including those funded by the Russian Government.  See <em>id.</em>, at 76a.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> But sometimes, the platforms decide, providing more information is not enough; instead, removing a post is the right course.  The platforms’ content-moderation policies also say when that is so.  Facebook’s Standards, for example, proscribe posts—with exceptions for “newsworth[iness]” and other “public interest value”—in categories and subcategories including: Violence and Criminal Behavior (<em>e.g.</em>, violence and incitement, coordinating harm and publicizing crime, fraud and deception); Safety (<em>e.g.</em>, suicide and self-injury, sexual exploitation, bullying and harassment); Objectionable Content (<em>e.g.</em>, hate speech, violent and graphic content); Integrity and Authenticity (<em>e.g.</em>, false news, manipulated media).  <em>Id.</em>, at 412a–415a, 441a–442a.  YouTube’s Guidelines similarly target videos falling within categories like: hate speech, violent or graphic content, child safety, and misinformation (including about elections and vaccines).  See <em>id.</em>, at 430a–432a.  The platforms thus &nbsp;unabashedly control the content that will appear to users, exercising authority to remove, label or demote messages they disfavor.<a aria-label=\"reference 6 of Kagan Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-6\" id=\"OPINION_4-6ref\"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Except that Texas’s law limits their power to do so.  As noted earlier, the law’s central provision prohibits the large social-media platforms (and maybe other entities&nbsp;<a aria-label=\"reference 7 of Kagan Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-7\" id=\"OPINION_4-7ref\"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup></a>) from “censor[ing]” a “user’s expression” based on its “viewpoint.”  §143A.002(a)(2); see <em>supra</em>, at 7.  The law defines “expression” broadly, thus including pretty much anything that might be posted.  See §143A.001(2).  And it defines “censor” to mean “block, ban, remove, deplatform, demonetize, de-boost, restrict, deny equal access or visibility to, or otherwise discriminate against expression.”  §143A.001(1).<a aria-label=\"reference 8 of Kagan Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-8\" id=\"OPINION_4-8ref\"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup></a>  That is a long list of verbs, but it comes down to this: The platforms cannot do any of the things they typically do (on their main feeds) to posts they disapprove—cannot demote, label, or remove them—whenever the action is based on the &nbsp;post’s viewpoint.<a aria-label=\"reference 9 of Kagan Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-9\" id=\"OPINION_4-9ref\"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup></a>  And what does that “based on viewpoint” requirement entail?  Doubtless some of the platforms’ content-moderation practices are based on characteristics of speech other than viewpoint (<em>e.g.</em>, on subject matter).  But if Texas’s law is enforced, the platforms could not—as they in fact do now—disfavor posts because they:</p>\n<p class=\"blbegin jy-both\">support Nazi ideology;</p>\n<p class=\"blpara jy-both\">advocate for terrorism;</p>\n<p class=\"blpara jy-both\">espouse racism, Islamophobia, or anti-Semitism;</p>\n<p class=\"blpara jy-both\">glorify rape or other gender-based violence;</p>\n<p class=\"blpara jy-both\">encourage teenage suicide and self-injury;</p>\n<p class=\"blpara jy-both\">discourage the use of vaccines;</p>\n<p class=\"blpara jy-both\">advise phony treatments for diseases;</p>\n<p class=\"blend jy-both\">advance false claims of election fraud.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">The list could continue for a while.<a aria-label=\"reference 10 of Kagan Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-10\" id=\"OPINION_4-10ref\"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup></a>  The point of it is not that the speech environment created by Texas’s law is worse than the ones to which the major platforms aspire on their main feeds.  The point is just that Texas’s law profoundly alters the platforms’ choices about the views they will, and will not, convey.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> And we have time and again held that type of regulation to interfere with protected speech.  Like the editors, cable &nbsp;operators, and parade organizers this Court has previously considered, the major social-media platforms are in the business, when curating their feeds, of combining “multifarious voices” to create a distinctive expressive offering.  <em>Hurley</em>, 515 U.&nbsp;S., at 569.  The individual messages may originate with third parties, but the larger offering is the platform’s.  It is the product of a wealth of choices about whether—and, if so, how—to convey posts having a certain content or viewpoint.  Those choices rest on a set of beliefs about which messages are appropriate and which are not (or which are more appropriate and which less so).  And in the aggregate they give the feed a particular expressive quality.  Consider again an opinion page editor, as in <em>Tornillo</em>,<em> </em>who wants to publish a variety of views, but thinks some things off-limits (or, to change the facts, worth only a couple of column inches).  “The choice of material,” the “decisions made [as to] content,” the “treatment of public issues”—“whether fair or unfair”—all these “constitute the exercise of editorial control and judgment.”  <em>Tornillo</em>,<em> </em>418 U.&nbsp;S., at 258.  For a paper, and for a platform too.  And the Texas law (like Florida’s earlier right-of-reply statute) targets those expressive choices—in particular, by forcing the major platforms to present and promote content on their feeds that they regard as objectionable.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> That those platforms happily convey the lion’s share of posts submitted to them makes no significant <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> difference.  Contra, 49 F.&nbsp;4th, at 459–461 (arguing otherwise).  To begin with, Facebook and YouTube exclude (not to mention, label or demote) lots of content from their News Feed and homepage.  The Community Standards and Community Guidelines set out in copious detail the varied kinds of speech the platforms want no truck with.  And both platforms appear to put those manuals to work.  In a single quarter of 2021, Facebook removed from its News Feed more than 25 million pieces of “hate speech content” and &nbsp;almost 9 million pieces of “bullying and harassment content.”  App. in No. 22–555, at 80a.  Similarly, YouTube deleted in one quarter more than 6 million videos violating its Guidelines.  See <em>id.</em>, at 116a.  And among those are the removals the Texas law targets.  What is more, this Court has already rightly declined to focus on the ratio of rejected to accepted content.  Recall that in <em>Hurley</em>, the parade organizers welcomed pretty much everyone, excluding only those who expressed a message of gay pride.  See <em>supra</em>, at 18.  The Court held that the organizers’ “lenient” admissions policy—and their resulting failure to express a “particularized message”—did “not forfeit” their right to reject the few messages they found harmful or offensive.  515 U.&nbsp;S., at 569, 574.  So too here, though the excluded viewpoints differ.  That Facebook and YouTube convey a mass of messages does not license Texas to prohibit them from deleting posts with, say, “hate speech” based on “sexual orientation.”  App. in No. 22–555, at 126a, 155a; see <em>id.</em>, at 431a.  It is as much an editorial choice to convey all speech except in select categories as to convey only speech within them.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Similarly, the major social-media platforms do not lose their <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> protection just because no one will wrongly attribute to them the views in an individual post.  Contra, 49 F.&nbsp;4th, at 462 (arguing otherwise).  For starters, users may well attribute to the platforms the messages that the posts convey <em>in&nbsp;toto</em>.  Those messages—communicated by the feeds as a whole—derive largely from the platforms’ editorial decisions about which posts to remove, label, or demote.  And because that is so, the platforms may indeed “own” the overall speech environment.  In any event, this Court has never hinged a compiler’s <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> protection on the risk of misattribution.  The Court did not think in <em>Turner</em>—and could not have thought in <em>Tornillo </em>or <em>PG&amp;E</em>—that anyone would view the entity conveying the third-party speech at issue as endorsing its content.  See <em>Turner I</em>, 512 U.&nbsp;S., at 655 (“[T]here appears little risk” of &nbsp;such misattribution).  Yet all those entities, the Court held, were entitled to <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> protection for refusing to carry the speech.  See <em>supra</em>, at 14–16.  To be sure, the Court noted in <em>PruneYard</em> and <em>FAIR</em>, when denying such protection,<em> </em>that there was little prospect of misattribution.  See 447 U.&nbsp;S., at 87; 547 U.&nbsp;S., at 65.  But the key fact in those cases, as noted above, was that the host of the third-party speech was not itself engaged in expression.  See <em>supra</em>, at 16–17.  The current record suggests the opposite as to Facebook’s News Feed and YouTube’s homepage.  When the platforms use their Standards and Guidelines to decide which third-party content those feeds will display, or how the display will be ordered and organized, they are making expressive choices.  And because that is true, they receive <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> protection.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">C</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> And once that much is decided, the interest Texas relies on cannot sustain its law.  In the usual <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> case, we must decide whether to apply strict or intermediate scrutiny.  But here we need not.  Even assuming that the less stringent form of <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> review applies, Texas’s law does not pass.  Under that standard, a law must further a “substantial governmental interest” that is “unrelated to the suppression of free expression.”  <em>United States</em> v. <em>O’Brien</em>, <a aria-label=\"391 U. S. 367\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/391/367\">391 U.&nbsp;S. 367</a>, 377 (1968).  Many possible interests relating to social media can meet that test; nothing said here puts regulation of NetChoice’s members off-limits as to a whole array of subjects.  But the interest Texas has asserted cannot carry the day: It is very much related to the suppression of free expression, and it is not valid, let alone substantial.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Texas has never been shy, and always been consistent, about its interest: The objective is to correct the mix of speech that the major social-media platforms present.  In this Court, Texas described its law as “respond[ing]” to the &nbsp;platforms’ practice of “favoring certain viewpoints.”  Brief for Texas 7; see <em>id.</em>, at 27 (explaining that the platforms’ “discrimination” among messages “led to [the law’s] enactment”).  The large social-media platforms throw out (or encumber) certain messages; Texas wants them kept in (and free from encumbrances), because it thinks that would create a better speech balance.  The current amalgam, the State explained in earlier briefing, was “skewed” to one side.  573 F.&nbsp;Supp. 3d, at 1116.  And that assessment mirrored the stated views of those who enacted the law, save that the latter had a bit more color.  The law’s main sponsor explained that the “West Coast oligarchs” who ran social-media companies were “silenc[ing] conservative viewpoints and ideas.”  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Governor, in signing the legislation, echoed the point: The companies were fomenting a “dangerous movement” to “silence” conservatives.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1108; &nbsp;see <em>id.</em>, at 1099 (“[S]ilencing conservative views is un-&nbsp;American, it’s un-Texan and it’s about to be illegal in Texas”).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> But a State may not interfere with private actors’ speech to advance its own vision of ideological balance.  States (and their citizens) are of course right to want an expressive realm in which the public has access to a wide range of views.  That is, indeed, a fundamental aim of the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>.  But the way the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> achieves that goal is by preventing <em>the government </em>from “tilt[ing] public debate in a preferred direction.”  <em>Sorrell</em> v. <em>IMS Health Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"564 U. S. 552\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/564/552\">564 U.&nbsp;S. 552</a>, 578–579 (2011).  It is not by licensing the government to stop <em>private actors</em> from speaking as they wish and preferring some views over others.  And that is so even when those actors possess “enviable vehicle[s]” for expression.  <em>Hurley</em>, 515 U.&nbsp;S., at 577.  In a better world, there would be fewer inequities in speech opportunities; and the government can take many steps to bring that world closer.  But it cannot prohibit speech to improve or better balance the speech market.  On the spectrum of &nbsp;dangers to free expression, there are few greater than allowing the government to change the speech of private actors in order to achieve its own conception of speech nirvana.  That is why we have said in so many contexts that the government may not “restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others.”  <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo</em>, <a aria-label=\"424 U. S. 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/424/1\">424 U.&nbsp;S. 1</a>, 48–49 (1976) (<em>per curiam</em>).  That unadorned interest is not “unrelated to the suppression of free expression,” and the government may not pursue it consistent with the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The Court’s decisions about editorial control, as discussed earlier, make that point repeatedly.  See <em>supra</em>, at 18–19.  Again, the question those cases had in common was whether the government could force a private speaker, including a compiler and curator of third-party speech, to convey views it disapproved.  And in most of those cases, the government defended its regulation as yielding greater balance in the marketplace of ideas.  But the Court—in <em>Tornillo</em>, in <em>PG&amp;E</em>, and again in <em>Hurley</em>—held that such an interest could not support the government’s effort to alter the speaker’s own expression.  “Our cases establish,” the <em>PG&amp;E </em>Court wrote, “that the State cannot advance some points of view by burdening the expression of others.”  475 U.&nbsp;S., at 20.  So the newspaper, the public utility, the parade organizer—whether acting “fair[ly] or unfair[ly]”—could exclude the unwanted message, free from government interference.  <em>Tornillo</em>, 418 U.&nbsp;S., at 258; see <em>United&nbsp;States Telecom Assn. </em>v. <em>FCC</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/855_F.3d_381\">855 F.&nbsp;3d 381</a>, 432 (CADC 2017) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (“[E]xcept in rare circumstances, the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> does not allow the Government to regulate the content choices of private editors just so that the Government may enhance certain voices and alter the content available to the citizenry”).<a aria-label=\"reference 11 of Kagan Opinion\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#OPINION_4-11\" id=\"OPINION_4-11ref\"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; The case here is no different.  The interest Texas asserts is in changing the balance of speech on the major platforms’ feeds, so that messages now excluded will be included.  To describe that interest, the State borrows language from this Court’s <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> cases, maintaining that it is preventing “viewpoint discrimination.”  Brief for Texas 19; see <em>supra</em>, at 26–27.  But the Court uses that language to say what governments cannot do: They cannot prohibit private actors from expressing certain views.  When Texas uses that language, it is to say what private actors cannot do: They cannot decide for themselves what views to convey.  The innocent-sounding phrase does not redeem the prohibited goal.  The reason Texas is regulating the content-&nbsp;moderation policies that the major platforms use for their feeds is to change the speech that will be displayed there.  Texas does not like the way those platforms are selecting and moderating content, and wants them to create a different expressive product, communicating different values and priorities.  But under the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>, that is a preference Texas may not impose.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">&nbsp;IV</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> These are facial challenges, and that matters.  To succeed on its <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> claim, NetChoice must show that the law at issue (whether from Texas or from Florida) “prohibits a substantial amount of protected speech relative to its plainly legitimate sweep.”  <em>Hansen</em>, 599 U.&nbsp;S., at 770.  None of the parties below focused on that issue; nor did the Fifth or Eleventh Circuits.  But that choice, unanimous as it has been, cannot now control.  Even in the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> context, facial challenges are disfavored, and neither parties nor courts can disregard the requisite inquiry into how a law works in all of its applications.  So on remand, each court must evaluate the full scope of the law’s coverage.  It must then decide which of the law’s applications are constitutionally permissible and which are not, and finally weigh the one against the other.  The need for NetChoice to carry its burden on those issues is the price of its decision to challenge the laws as a whole.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> But there has been enough litigation already to know that the Fifth Circuit, if it stayed the course, would get wrong at least one significant input into the facial analysis.  The parties treated Facebook’s News Feed and YouTube’s homepage as the heartland applications of the Texas law.  At least on the current record, the editorial judgments influencing the content of those feeds are, contrary to the Fifth Circuit’s view, protected expressive activity.  And Texas may not interfere with those judgments simply because it would prefer a different mix of messages.  How that matters for the requisite facial analysis is for the Fifth Circuit to decide.  But it should conduct that analysis in keeping with two <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> precepts.  First, presenting a curated and “edited compilation of [third party] speech” is itself protected speech.  <em>Hurley</em>, 515 U.&nbsp;S., at 570.  And second, a State “cannot advance some points of view by burdening the expression of others.”  <em>PG&amp;E</em>,<em> </em>475 U.&nbsp;S., at 20.  To give government that power is to enable it to control the &nbsp;expression of ideas, promoting those it favors and suppressing those it does not.

As noted, requirements of that kind violate the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> if they unduly burden expressive activity.  See <em>Zauderer</em> v. <em>Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio</em>, <a aria-label=\"471 U. S. 626\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/471/626\">471 U.&nbsp;S. 626</a>, 651 (1985); <em>supra</em>, at 11.  So our explanation of why Facebook and YouTube are engaged in expression when they make content-moderation choices in their main feeds should inform the courts’ further consideration of that issue.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-5\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Kagan Opinion at reference 5\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-5ref\">5</a> &nbsp;Of course, an entity engaged in expressive activity when performing one function may not be when carrying out another.  That is one lesson of <em>FAIR</em>.  The Court ruled as it did because the law schools’ recruiting services were not engaged in expression.  See <a aria-label=\"547 U. S. 47\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/547/47\">547 U.&nbsp;S. 47</a>, 64 (2006).  The case could not have been resolved on that ground if the regulation had affected what happened in law school classes instead.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-6\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Kagan Opinion at reference 6\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-6ref\">6</a> &nbsp;We therefore do not deal here with feeds whose algorithms respond solely to how users act online—giving them the content they appear to want, without any regard to independent content standards.  See <em>post</em>, at 2 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Barrett, J.,</span> concurring).  Like them or loathe them, the Community Standards and Community Guidelines make a wealth of user-agnostic judgments about what kinds of speech, including what viewpoints, are not worthy of promotion.  And those judgments show up in Facebook’s and YouTube’s main feeds.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-7\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Kagan Opinion at reference 7\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-7ref\">7</a> &nbsp;The scope of the Texas law, a matter crucial to the facial inquiry, is unsettled, as previously discussed.  See <em>supra</em>, at 10–11.  The Texas solicitor general at oral argument stated that he understood the law to cover Facebook and YouTube, but “d[id]n’t know” whether it also covered other platforms and applications.  Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 22–555, pp.&nbsp;61–62.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-8\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Kagan Opinion at reference 8\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-8ref\">8</a> &nbsp;In addition to barring “censor[ship]” of “expression,” the law bars “censor[ship]” of people.  More specifically, it prohibits taking the designated “censor[ial]” actions against any “user” based on his “viewpoint,” regardless of whether that “viewpoint is expressed on a social media platform.”  §§143A.002(a)(1), (b); see <em>supra</em>, at 7.  Because the Fifth Circuit did not focus on that provision, instead confining its analysis to the law’s ban on “censor[ing]” a “user’s expression” on the platform, we do the same.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-9\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Kagan Opinion at reference 9\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-9ref\">9</a> &nbsp;The Texas solicitor general explained at oral argument that the Texas law allows the platforms to remove “categories” of speech, so long as they are not based on viewpoint.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 22–555, at 69–70; §120.052 (Acceptable Use Policy).  The example he gave was speech about Al-Qaeda.  Under the law, a platform could remove all posts about Al-Qaeda, regardless of viewpoint.  But it could not stop the “pro-&nbsp;Al-Qaeda” speech alone; it would have to stop the “anti-Al-Qaeda” speech too.  Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 22–555, at 70.  So again, the law, as described by the solicitor general, prevents the platforms from disfavoring posts because they express one view of a subject.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-10\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Kagan Opinion at reference 10\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-10ref\">10</a> &nbsp;Details on both the enumerated examples and similar ones are found in Facebook’s Community Standards and YouTube’s Community Guidelines.  See https://transparency.meta.com/policies/community-standards; https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9288567.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"OPINION_4-11\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Kagan Opinion at reference 11\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#OPINION_4-11ref\">11</a> &nbsp;Texas claims <em>Turner </em>as a counter-example, but that decision offers no help to speak of.  <em>Turner</em> did indeed hold that the FCC’s must-carry provisions, requiring cable operators to give some of their channel space to local broadcast stations, passed <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> muster.  See <em>supra</em>, at 15.  But the interest there advanced was not to balance expressive content; rather, the interest was to save the local-broadcast industry, so that it could continue to serve households without cable.  That interest, the Court explained, was “unrelated to the content of expression” disseminated by either cable or broadcast speakers.  <em>Turner I</em>, <a aria-label=\"512 U. S. 622\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/512/622\">512 U.&nbsp;S. 622</a>, 647 (1994).  And later, the <em>Hurley </em>Court again noted the difference.  It understood the Government interest in <em>Turner </em>as one relating to competition policy: The FCC needed to limit the cable operators’ “monopolistic,” gatekeeping position “in order to allow for the survival of broadcasters.”  515 U.&nbsp;S., at 577.  Unlike in regulating the parade—or here in regulating Facebook’s News Feed or YouTube’s homepage—the Government’s interest was “not the alteration of speech.”  <em>Ibid</em>.  And when that is so, the prospects of permissible regulation are entirely different.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"concurrence\">&nbsp;<hr><a aria-label=\"Top\" href=\"#writing-ZS\" id=\"writing-22-277_CONCUR_5\"><strong>TOP</strong></a>\n<h2>Concurrence</h2>\n<div class=\"bodytext\">\n<p class=\"scusnameplate jy-center\">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p class=\"rule jy-center\">_________________</p>\n<p class=\"casenumber jy-center\">Nos. 22–277 and 22–555</p>\n<p class=\"rule jy-center\">_________________</p>\n<p class=\"videfirstline jy-center\">ASHLEY MOODY, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF FLORIDA, <span class=\"smallcaps\">et&nbsp;al.</span>, PETITIONERS</p>\n<p class=\"v jy-left\">22–277 <em>v.</em></p>\n<p class=\"videsecondline jy-center\">NETCHOICE, LLC, <span class=\"smallcaps\">dba</span> NETCHOICE, <span class=\"smallcaps\">et al</span>.</p>\n<h4 class=\"sylct-b sc-1 jy-center\">on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit</h4>\n<p class=\"normal jy-both\"></p>\n<p class=\"videfirstline jy-center\">NETCHOICE, LLC, <span class=\"smallcaps\">dba</span> NETCHOICE, <span class=\"smallcaps\">et al</span>., PETITIONERS</p>\n<p class=\"v jy-left\">22–555 <em>v.</em></p>\n<p class=\"videsecondline jy-center\">KEN PAXTON, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF TEXAS</p>\n<h4 class=\"sylct-b sc-1 jy-center\">on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit</h4>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"opiniondates\">[July 1, 2024]</div>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"casct-a jy-both\"><span class=\"smallcaps\"> Justice Barrett</span>, concurring.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> I join the Court’s opinion, which correctly articulates and applies our <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> precedent.  In this respect, the Eleventh Circuit’s understanding of the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>’s protection of editorial discretion was generally correct; the Fifth Circuit’s was not.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> But for the reasons the Court gives, these cases illustrate the dangers of bringing a facial challenge.  If NetChoice’s members are concerned about preserving their editorial discretion with respect to the services on which they have focused throughout this litigation—<em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., Facebook’s Newsfeed and YouTube’s homepage—they would be better served by bringing a <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> challenge as applied to those functions.  Analyzing how the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> bears on &nbsp;those functions is complicated enough without simultaneously analyzing how it bears on a platform’s other functions—<em>e.g.</em>, Facebook Messenger and Google Search—much less to distinct platforms like Uber and Etsy.  In fact, dealing with a broad swath of varied platforms and functions in a facial challenge strikes me as a daunting, if not impossible, task.  A function qualifies for <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> protection only if it is inherently expressive.  <em>Hurley</em> v. <em>Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"515 U. S. 557\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/515/557\">515 U.&nbsp;S. 557</a>, 568 (1995).  Even for a prototypical social-media feed, making this determination involves more than meets the eye.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Consider, for instance, how platforms use algorithms to prioritize and remove content on their feeds.  Assume that human beings decide to remove posts promoting a particular political candidate or advocating some position on a public-health issue.  If they create an algorithm to help them identify and delete that content, the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> protects their exercise of editorial judgment—even if the algorithm does most of the deleting without a person in the loop.  In that event, the algorithm would simply implement human beings’ inherently expressive choice “to exclude a message [they] did not like from” their speech compilation.  <em>Id.</em>, at 574.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> But what if a platform’s algorithm just presents automatically to each user whatever the algorithm thinks the user will like—<em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., content similar to posts with which the user previously engaged?  See <em>ante</em>, at 22, n.&nbsp;5.  The <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> implications of the Florida and Texas laws might be different for that kind of algorithm.  And what about AI, which is rapidly evolving?  What if a platform’s owners hand the reins to an AI tool and ask it simply to remove “hateful” content?  If the AI relies on large language models to determine what is “hateful” and should be removed, has a human being with <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> rights made an inherently expressive “choice .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not to propound &nbsp;a particular point of view”?  <em>Hurley</em>, 515 U.&nbsp;S., at 575.  In other words, technology may attenuate the connection between content-moderation <em>actions</em> (<em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., removing posts) and human beings’ constitutionally protected right to “<em>decide</em> <em>for [themselves]</em> the ideas and beliefs deserving of expression, consideration, and adherence.”  <em>Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, <a aria-label=\"512 U. S. 622\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/512/622\">512 U.&nbsp;S. 622</a>, 641 (1994) (emphasis added).  So the way platforms use this sort of technology might have constitutional significance.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> There can be other complexities too.  For example, the corporate structure and ownership of some platforms may be relevant to the constitutional analysis.  A speaker’s right to “decide ‘what not to say’&nbsp;” is “enjoyed by business corporations generally.”  <em>Hurley</em>, 515 U.&nbsp;S., at 573–574 (quoting <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co.</em> v. <em>Public Util. Comm’n of Cal.</em>, <a aria-label=\"475 U. S. 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/475/1\">475 U.&nbsp;S. 1</a>, 16 (1986)).  Corporations, which are composed of human beings with <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> rights, possess <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> rights themselves.  See <em>Citizens United</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm’n</em>, <a aria-label=\"558 U. S. 310\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/558/310\">558 U.&nbsp;S. 310</a>, 365 (2010); cf. <em>Burwell</em> v. <em>Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"573 U. S. 682\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/573/682\">573 U.&nbsp;S. 682</a>, 706–707 (2014).  But foreign persons and corporations located abroad do not.  <em>Agency for Int’l Development</em> v. <em>Alliance for Open Society Int’l, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"591 U. S. 430\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/591/430\">591 U.&nbsp;S. 430</a>, 433–436 (2020).  So a social-media platform’s foreign ownership and control over its content-moderation decisions might affect whether laws overriding those decisions trigger <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> scrutiny.  What if the platform’s corporate leadership abroad makes the policy decisions about the viewpoints and content the platform will disseminate?  Would it matter that the corporation &nbsp;employs Americans to develop and implement content-&nbsp;moderation algorithms if they do so at the direction of foreign executives?  Courts may need to confront such questions when applying the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> to certain platforms.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> These are just a few examples of questions that might &nbsp;arise in litigation that more thoroughly exposes the relevant facts about particular social-media platforms and functions.  The answers in any given case might cast doubt on—or might vindicate—a social-media company’s invocation of its <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> rights.  Regardless, the analysis is bound to be fact intensive, and it will surely vary from function to function and platform to platform.  And in a facial challenge, answering all of those questions isn’t even the end of the story: The court must then find a way to measure the unconstitutional relative to the constitutional applications to determine whether the law “prohibits a substantial amount of protected speech relative to its plainly legitimate sweep.”  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Hansen</em>, <a aria-label=\"599 U. S. 762\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/599/762\">599 U.&nbsp;S. 762</a>, 770 (2023) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> A facial challenge to either of these laws likely forces a court to bite off more than it can chew.  An as-applied challenge, by contrast, would enable courts to home in on whether and how specific functions—like feeds versus direct messaging—are inherently expressive and answer platform- and function-specific questions that might bear on the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> analysis.  While the governing constitutional principles are straightforward, applying them in one fell swoop to the entire social-media universe is not.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"opinion\">&nbsp;<hr><a aria-label=\"Top\" href=\"#writing-ZS\" id=\"writing-22-277_OPINION_6\"><strong>TOP</strong></a>\n<h2>Opinion</h2>\n<div class=\"bodytext\">\n<p class=\"scusnameplate jy-center\">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p class=\"rule jy-center\">_________________</p>\n<p class=\"casenumber jy-center\">Nos. 22–277 and 22–555</p>\n<p class=\"rule jy-center\">_________________</p>\n<p class=\"videfirstline jy-center\">ASHLEY MOODY, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF FLORIDA, <span class=\"smallcaps\">et&nbsp;al.</span>, PETITIONERS</p>\n<p class=\"v jy-left\">22–277 <em>v.</em></p>\n<p class=\"videsecondline jy-center\">NETCHOICE, LLC, <span class=\"smallcaps\">dba</span> NETCHOICE, <span class=\"smallcaps\">et al</span>.</p>\n<h4 class=\"sylct-b sc-1 jy-center\">on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit</h4>\n<p class=\"normal jy-both\"></p>\n<p class=\"videfirstline jy-center\">NETCHOICE, LLC, <span class=\"smallcaps\">dba</span> NETCHOICE, <span class=\"smallcaps\">et al</span>., PETITIONERS</p>\n<p class=\"v jy-left\">22–555 <em>v.</em></p>\n<p class=\"videsecondline jy-center\">KEN PAXTON, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF TEXAS</p>\n<h4 class=\"sylct-b sc-1 jy-center\">on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit</h4>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"opiniondates\">[July 1, 2024]</div>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"casct-a jy-both\"><span class=\"smallcaps\"> Justice Jackson</span>, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> These cases present a complex clash between two novel state laws and the alleged <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> rights of several of the largest social media platforms.  Some things are already clear.  Not every potential action taken by a social media company will qualify as expression protected under the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>.  But not every hypothesized regulation of such a company’s operations will necessarily be able to withstand the force of the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>’s protections either.  Beyond those broadest of statements, it is difficult to say much more at this time.  With these records and lower court decisions, we are not able to adequately evaluate whether the challenged state laws are facially valid.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> That is in no small part because, as all Members of the &nbsp;Court acknowledge, plaintiffs bringing a facial challenge must clear a high bar.  See <em>ante,</em> at 9–10 (majority opinion); <em>post</em>, at 13–14 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Alito, J., </span>concurring in judgment).  The Eleventh Circuit failed to appreciate the nature of this challenge, and the Fifth Circuit did not adequately evaluate it.  That said, I agree with <span class=\"smallcaps\">Justice Barrett</span> that the Eleventh Circuit at least fairly stated our <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> precedent, whereas the Fifth Circuit did not.  See <em>ante</em>, at 1 (concurring opinion); see also <em>ante,</em> at 13–19 (majority opinion).  On remand, then, both courts will have to undertake their legal analyses anew.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In doing so, the lower courts must address these cases at the right level of specificity.  The question is not whether an entire category of corporations (like social media companies) or a particular entity (like Facebook) is generally engaged in expression.  Nor is it enough to say that a given activity (say, content moderation) for a particular service (the News Feed, for example) seems roughly analogous to a more familiar example from our precedent.  Cf. <em>Red Lion Broadcasting Co.</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, <a aria-label=\"395 U. S. 367\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/395/367\">395 U.&nbsp;S. 367</a>, 386 (1969) (positing that “differences in the characteristics of new media justify differences in the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> standards applied to them”).  Even when evaluating a broad facial challenge, courts must make sure they carefully parse not only what entities are regulated, but how the regulated activities<em> actually function</em> before deciding if the activity in question constitutes expression and therefore comes within the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>’s ambit.  See Brief for Knight <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> Institute at Columbia University as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 11–12.  Thus, further factual development may be necessary before either of today’s challenges can be fully and fairly addressed.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In light of the high bar for facial challenges and the state of these cases as they come to us, I would not go on to treat either like an as-applied challenge and preview our potential ruling on the merits.  Faced with difficult constitutional &nbsp;issues arising in new contexts on undeveloped records, this Court should strive to avoid deciding more than is necessary.  See <em>Ashwander</em> v. <em>TVA</em>, <a aria-label=\"297 U. S. 288\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/297/288\">297 U.&nbsp;S. 288</a>, 346–347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).

The Court’s discussion is unnecessary to its holding.  See <em>Jama</em> v. <em>Immigration and Customs Enforcement</em>, <a aria-label=\"543 U. S. 335\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/543/335\">543 U.&nbsp;S. 335</a>, 351, &nbsp;n. 12 (2005) (“Dictum settles nothing, even in the court that utters it”).  Moreover, the Court engages in the exact type of analysis that it chastises the Courts of Appeals for performing.  It faults the Courts of Appeals for focusing on only one subset of applications, rather than determining &nbsp;whether each statute’s “full range of applications” are constitutional.  See <em>ante,</em> at 10, 12.  But, the Court repeats that very same error.  Out of the sea of “variegated and complex” functions that platforms perform, <em>ante</em>, at 11,<em> </em>the Court plucks out two (Facebook’s News Feed and YouTube’s homepage), and declares that they may be protected by the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>.  See <em>ante,</em> at 26 (opining on what the “current record suggests”).  The Court does so on a record that it itself describes as “incomplete” and “underdeveloped,” <em>ante,</em> at 12, 20, and by sidestepping several pressing factual and legal questions, see <em>post</em>, at 29–32 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Alito</span>, J., concurring in judgment).

The trade associations have brought facial challenges alleging that H.&nbsp;B. 20 and S.&nbsp;B. 7072 are unconstitutional in many or all of their applications.  But, Art-icle&nbsp;III of the Constitution permits federal courts to exercise judicial power only over “Cases” and “Controversies.”  Accordingly, federal courts can decide whether a statute is constitutional only as applied to the parties before them—they lack authority to deem a statute “facially” unconstitutional.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">I</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> As <span class=\"smallcaps\">Justice Alito</span> explains, the trade associations have failed to provide many of the basic facts necessary to evaluate their challenges to H.&nbsp;B. 20 and S.&nbsp;B. 7072.  See <em>post</em>, at 22–29.  I make two additional observations.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> First, with respect to certain provisions of H.&nbsp;B. 20 and S.&nbsp;B. 7072, the Court assumes that the framework outlined in <em>Zauderer</em> v. <em>Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio</em>, <a aria-label=\"471 U.S. 626\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/471/626\">471 U.&nbsp;S. 626 (1985)</a>, applies.  See <em>ante</em>, at &nbsp;11.  In that case, the Court held that laws requiring the disclosure of factual information in commercial advertising may satisfy the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> if the disclosures are “reasonably related” to the Government’s interest in preventing consumer deception.  471 U.&nbsp;S., at 651.  Because the trade associations did not contest <em>Zauderer</em>’s applicability before the Eleventh Circuit and both lower courts applied its framework, I agree with the Court’s decision to rely upon <em>Zauderer </em>at this stage.  However, I think we should reconsider <em>Zauderer </em>and its progeny.  “I am skeptical of the premise on which <em>Zauderer </em>rests—that, in the commercial-speech context, the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> interests implicated by disclosure requirements are substantially weaker than those at stake when speech is actually suppressed.”  <em>Milavetz, Gallop &amp; Milavetz, P.&nbsp;A.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"559 U. S. 229\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/559/229\">559 U.&nbsp;S. 229</a>, 255 (2010) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas</span>, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Second, the common-carrier doctrine should continue to guide the lower courts’ examination of the trade associations’ claims on remand.  See <em>post</em>, at 18, and n.&nbsp;17, 30 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Alito</span>, J.).  “[O]ur legal system and its British predecessor have long subjected certain businesses, known as common carriers, to special regulations, including a general requirement to serve all comers.”  <em>Biden</em> v. <em>Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia Univ.</em>, 593 U.&nbsp;S. ___, ___ (2021) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas</span>, J., concurring in grant of certiorari) (slip op., at 3).  Moreover, “there is clear historical precedent for regulating transportation and communications networks in a similar manner as traditional common carriers” given their many similarities.  <em>Id</em>., at ___ (slip op., at 5).  Though they reached different conclusions, both the Fifth Circuit and the Eleventh Circuit appropriately strove to apply the common-carrier doctrine in assessing the constitutionality of H.&nbsp;B. 20 and S.&nbsp;B. 7072 respectively.  See 49 F.&nbsp;4th 439, 469–480 (CA5 2022); <em>NetChoice</em> v. <em>Attorney Gen., Fla</em>., 34 F.&nbsp;4th 1196, 1219–1222 (CA11 2022).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; The common-carrier doctrine may have weighty implications for the trade associations’ claims.  But, the same factual barriers that preclude the Court from assessing the trade associations’ claims under our <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> precedents also prevent us from applying the common-carrier doctrine in this posture.  At a minimum, we would need to pinpoint the regulated parties and specific conduct being regulated.  On remand, however, both lower courts should continue to consider the common-carrier doctrine.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">II</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The opinions in these cases detail many of the considerable hurdles that currently preclude resolution of the trade associations’ claims.  See <em>ante,</em> at 9–10; <em>ante</em>, at 1–4 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Barrett</span>, J., concurring); <em>post</em>, at 22–32 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Alito</span>, J.).  The most significant problem of all, however, has yet to be addressed: Federal courts lack authority to adjudicate the trade associations’ facial challenges.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Rather than allege that the statutes impermissibly regulate them, the trade associations assert that H.&nbsp;B. 20 and S.&nbsp;B. 7072 are actually unconstitutional in most or all of their applications.  This type of challenge, called a facial challenge, is “an attack on a statute itself as opposed to a particular application.”  <em>Los Angeles</em> v. <em>Patel</em>, <a aria-label=\"576 U. S. 409\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/576/409\">576 U.&nbsp;S. 409</a>, 415 (2015).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Facial challenges are fundamentally at odds with Article III.  Because Article III limits federal courts’ judicial power to cases or controversies, federal courts “lac[k] the power to pronounce that [a] statute is unconstitutional” as applied to nonparties.  <em>Americans for Prosperity Foundation</em> v. <em>Bonta</em>, <a aria-label=\"594 U. S. 595\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/594/595\">594 U.&nbsp;S. 595</a>, 621 (2021) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas</span>, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Entertaining facial challenges in spite of that limitation arrogates powers reserved to the political branches and disturbs the relationship between the Federal Government and the States.  The practice of adjudicating facial &nbsp;challenges creates practical concerns as well.  Facial challenges’ dubious historical roots further confirm that the doctrine should have no place in our jurisprudence.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">A</h3>\n<h4 class=\"jy-center\">1</h4>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Article III empowers federal courts to exercise “judicial Power” only over “Cases” and “Controversies.”  This Court has long recognized that those terms impose substantive constraints on the authority of federal courts.  See <em>Muskrat</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"219 U. S. 346\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/219/346\">219 U.&nbsp;S. 346</a>, 356–358 (1911); see also <em>Steel Co.</em> v. <em>Citizens for Better Environment</em>, <a aria-label=\"523 U. S. 83\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/523/83\">523 U.&nbsp;S. 83</a>, 102 (1998).  One corollary of the case-or-controversy requirement is that while federal courts can judge the constitutionality of statutes, they may do so only to the extent necessary to resolve the case at hand.  “It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is,” but only because “[t]hose who apply the rule to particular cases, must of necessity expound and interpret that rule.”  <em>Marbury </em>v. <em>Madison</em>, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803); see <em>Liverpool, New York &amp; Philadelphia S. S. Co.</em> v. <em>Commissioners of Emigration</em>, <a aria-label=\"113 U. S. 33\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/113/33\">113 U.&nbsp;S. 33</a>, 39 (1885) (“[The Court] has no jurisdiction to pronounce any statute .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. irreconcilable with the Constitution, except as it is called upon to adjudge the legal rights of litigants in actual controversies”).  Accordingly, “[e]xcept when necessary” to resolve a case or controversy, “courts have no charter to review and revise legislative and executive action.”  <em>Summers</em> v. <em>Earth Island Institute</em>, <a aria-label=\"555 U. S. 488\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/555/488\">555 U.&nbsp;S. 488</a>, 492 (2009); see <em>United States</em> v. <em>Raines</em>, <a aria-label=\"362 U. S. 17\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/362/17\">362 U.&nbsp;S. 17</a>, 20–21 (1960).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> These limitations on the power of judicial review play an essential role in preserving our constitutional structure.  Our Constitution sets forth a “tripartite allocation of power,” separating different types of powers across three co-equal branches.  <em>DaimlerChrysler Corp.</em> v. <em>Cuno</em>, <a aria-label=\"547 U. S. 332\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/547/332\">547 U.&nbsp;S. 332</a>, 341 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).  “[E]ach &nbsp;branch [is vested] with an exclusive form of power,” and “no branch can encroach upon the powers confided to the others.”  <em>Patchak </em>v. <em>Zinke</em>, <a aria-label=\"583 U. S. 244\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/583/244\">583 U.&nbsp;S. 244</a>, 250 (2018) (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted).  In the Judicial Branch’s case, it is vested with the “ultimate and supreme” power of judicial review.  <em>Chicago &amp; Grand Trunk R. Co.</em> v. <em>Wellman</em>, <a aria-label=\"143 U. S. 339\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/143/339\">143 U.&nbsp;S. 339</a>, 345 (1892).  That power includes the authority to refuse to apply a statute enacted and approved by the other two branches of the Federal Government.  But, the power of judicial review can be wielded only in specific circumstances and to limited ends—to resolve cases and controversies.  Without that limitation, the Judiciary would have an unchecked ability to enjoin duly enacted statutes.  Respecting the case-or-controversy requirement is therefore necessary to “preven[t] the Federal Judiciary from intruding upon the powers given to the other branches, and confin[e] the federal courts to a properly judicial role.”  <em>Town of Chester</em> v. <em>Laroe Estates, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"581 U. S. 433\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/581/433\">581 U.&nbsp;S. 433</a>, 438 (2017) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">2</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Facial challenges conflict with Article III’s case-or-controversy requirement because they ask a federal court to decide whether a statute might conflict with the Constitution in cases that are not before the court.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> To bring a facial challenge under our precedents, a plaintiff must ordinarily “establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.”  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Salerno</em>, <a aria-label=\"481 U. S. 739\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/481/739\">481 U.&nbsp;S. 739</a>, 745 (1987).  In the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> context, we have sometimes applied an even looser standard, called the overbreadth doctrine.  The overbreadth doctrine requires a plaintiff to establish only that a statute “prohibits a substantial amount of protected speech,” “relative to [its] plainly legitimate sweep.”  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Williams</em>, <a aria-label=\"553 U. S. 285\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/553/285\">553 U.&nbsp;S. 285</a>, 292 (2008).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; Facial challenges ask courts to issue holdings that are rarely, if ever, required to resolve a single case or controversy.  The only way a plaintiff gets into a federal court is by showing that he “personally has suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the defendant.”  <em>Blum</em> v. <em>Yaretsky</em>, <a aria-label=\"457 U. S. 991\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/457/991\">457 U.&nbsp;S. 991</a>, 999 (1982) (internal quotation marks omitted).  And, the only remedy a plaintiff should leave a federal court with is one “limited to the inadequacy that produced the injury in fact that the plaintiff has established.”  <em>Lewis</em> v. <em>Casey</em>, <a aria-label=\"518 U. S. 343\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/518/343\">518 U.&nbsp;S. 343</a>, 357 (1996).  Accordingly, once a court decides whether a statute can be validly enforced against the plaintiff who challenges it, that case or controversy is resolved.  Either the court remedies the plaintiff&nbsp;’s injury, or it determines that the statute may be constitutionally applied to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Proceeding to decide the merits of possible constitutional challenges that could be brought by <em>other</em> plaintiffs is not necessary to resolve that case.  Instead, any holding with respect to potential future plaintiffs would be “no more than an advisory opinion—which a federal court should never issue at all, and <em>especially </em>should not issue with regard to a constitutional question, as to which we seek to avoid even <em>non</em>advisory opinions.”  <em>Chicago</em> v. <em>Morales</em>, <a aria-label=\"527 U. S. 41\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/527/41\">527 U.&nbsp;S. 41</a>, 77 (1999) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Unsurprisingly, facial challenges are at odds with doctrines enforcing the case-or-controversy requirement.  Pursuant to standing doctrine, for example, a plaintiff can maintain a suit in a federal court—and thus invoke judicial power—only if he has suffered an “injury” with a “traceable connection” to the “complained-of conduct of the defendant.”  <em>Steel Co.</em>, 523 U.&nbsp;S., at 103.  Facial challenges significantly relax those rules.  Start with the injury requirement.  Facial challenges allow a plaintiff to challenge applications of a statute that have not injured him.  But see <em>Acheson Hotels, LLC </em>v. <em>Laufer</em>, <a aria-label=\"601 U. S. 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/601/1\">601 U.&nbsp;S. 1</a>, 10 (2023) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas</span>, J., concurring in judgment) (“To have standing, a plaintiff must assert a violation of his [own] rights”).  In fact, under our <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> overbreadth doctrine, a plaintiff need not be injured at all; he can challenge a statute that <em>lawfully </em>applies to him so long as it would be unlawful to enforce it against others.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Hansen</em>, <a aria-label=\"599 U. S. 762\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/599/762\">599 U.&nbsp;S. 762</a>, 769 (2023).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Facial challenges also distort standing doctrine’s redressability requirement.  The Court has held that a plaintiff has standing to sue only when his “requested relief will redress the alleged injury.”  <em>Steel Co.</em>, 523 U.&nbsp;S., at 103.  With a facial challenge, however, a plaintiff seeks to enjoin every application of a statute—including ones that have nothing to do with his injury.  A plaintiff can ask, “Do [I] just want [the court] to say that this statute cannot constitutionally be applied to [me] in this case, or do [I] want to go for broke and try to get the statute pronounced void in all its applications?”  <em>Morales</em>, 527 U.&nbsp;S., at 77 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  In this sense, the remedy sought by a facial challenge is akin to a universal injunction—a practice that is itself “inconsistent with longstanding limits on equitable relief and the power of Article III courts.”  <em>Trump</em> v. <em>Hawaii</em>, <a aria-label=\"585 U. S. 667\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/585/667\">585 U.&nbsp;S. 667</a>, 713 (2018) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas</span>, J., concurring); see <em>Department of Homeland Security</em> v. <em>New York</em>, 589 U.&nbsp;S. ___, ___–___ (2020) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Gorsuch</span>, J., concurring in grant of stay) (slip op., at 2–3); <em>FDA </em>v. <em>Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine</em>, <a aria-label=\"602 U. S. 367\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/602/367\">602 U.&nbsp;S. 367</a>, 402 (2024) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas</span>, J., concurring).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Because deciding the constitutionality of a statute as applied to nonparties is not necessary to resolve a case or controversy, it is beyond a federal court’s constitutional authority.  Federal courts have “no power <em>per se</em> to review and annul acts of Congress on the ground that they are unconstitutional.  That question may be considered only when the justification for some direct injury suffered or threatened, presenting a justiciable issue, is made to rest upon such an &nbsp;act.”  <em>Massachusetts</em> v. <em>Mellon</em>, <a aria-label=\"262 U. S. 447\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/262/447\">262 U.&nbsp;S. 447</a>, 488 (1923).  Resolving facial challenges thus violates Article III.<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Thomas Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_7-1\" id=\"CONCUR_7-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">3</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Adjudicating facial challenges also intrudes upon powers reserved to the Legislative and Executive Branches and the States.  When a federal court decides an issue unnecessary for resolving a case or controversy, the Judiciary assumes authority beyond what the Constitution granted.  <em>Supra</em>, at 5–6.  That necessarily alters the balance of powers: When one branch exceeds its vested power, it becomes stronger relative to the other branches.  See <em>Free Enterprise Fund</em> v. <em>Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd</em>., <a aria-label=\"561 U. S. 477\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/561/477\">561 U.&nbsp;S. 477</a>, 500 (2010).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Moreover, by exceeding their Article III powers, federal courts risk interfering with the executive and legislative functions.  Facial challenges enable federal courts to review the constitutionality of a statute in many or all of its applications—often before the statute has even been enforced.  In practice, this provides federal courts a “general veto power .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. upon the legislation of Congress.”  <em>Muskrat</em>, 219 U.&nbsp;S., at 357.  But, the Judicial Branch has no such constitutional role in lawmaking.  When courts take on the supervisory role of judging statutes in the abstract, they thus “assume a position of authority over the governmental acts of another and co-equal department, an authority which plainly [they] do not possess.”  <em>Mellon</em>, 262 U.&nbsp;S., at 489.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Comparing the effects of as-applied challenges and facial &nbsp;challenges makes this point clear.  With an as-applied challenge, the Judiciary intrudes only as much as necessary on the will “&nbsp;‘of the elected representatives of the people.’&nbsp;”  <em>Washington State Grange</em> v. <em>Washington State Republican Party</em>, <a aria-label=\"552 U. S. 442\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/552/442\">552 U.&nbsp;S. 442</a>, 451 (2008).  Assuming a court adheres to traditional remedial limits, a successful as-applied challenge only prevents application of the statute against that plaintiff.  The Executive Branch remains free to enforce the statute in all of its other applications.  And, the court’s decision provides some notice to the political branches, enabling the Executive Branch to tailor future enforcement of the statute to avoid violating the Constitution or Congress to amend the statute.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Facial challenges, however, force the Judiciary to take a maximalist approach.  A single plaintiff can immediately call upon a federal court to declare an entire statute unconstitutional, even before it has been applied to him.  The political branches have no opportunity to correct course, making legislation an all-or-nothing proposition.  The end result is that “the democratic process” is “short circuit[ed]” and “laws embodying the will of the people [are prevented] from being implemented in a manner consistent with the Constitution.”  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In a similar vein, facial challenges distort the relationship between the Federal Government and the States.  The Constitution “establishes a system of dual sovereignty between the States and the Federal Government.”  <em>Gregory</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, <a aria-label=\"501 U. S. 452\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/501/452\">501 U.&nbsp;S. 452</a>, 457 (1991).  The States retain all powers “not delegated” to the Federal Government and not “prohibited by [the Constitution] to the States.”  Amdt. 10.  Facial challenges can upset this division by shifting power from the States to the Federal Judiciary.  Most obviously, when a state law is challenged, a facial challenge prevents that State from applying its own statute in a constitutional manner.  But, facial challenges can also force federal courts to appropriate the role of state courts.  To analyze whether &nbsp;a statute is valid on its face, a court must determine the statute’s scope.  If a state court has yet to determine the scope of its statute (a common occurrence with facial challenges), the federal court must do so in the first instance.  Facial challenges thus increase the likelihood that federal courts must interpret novel state-law questions—a role typically and appropriately reserved for state courts.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> In addition to their constitutional infirmities, facial challenges also create practical problems.  The case-or-controversy requirement serves as the foundation of our adversarial system.  Rather than “&nbsp;‘sit[ting] as self-directed boards of legal inquiry and research,’&nbsp;” federal courts serve as “&nbsp;‘arbiters of legal questions presented and argued by the parties before them.’&nbsp;”  <em>NASA</em> v. <em>Nelson</em>, <a aria-label=\"562 U. S. 134\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/562/134\">562 U.&nbsp;S. 134</a>, 147, n.&nbsp;10 (2011) (quoting <em>Carducci </em>v. <em>Regan</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/714_F.2d_171\">714 F.&nbsp;2d 171</a>, 177 (CADC 1983) (opinion for the court by Scalia, J.)).  This system “assure[s] that the legal questions presented to the court will be resolved .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in a concrete factual context conducive to a realistic appreciation of the consequences of judicial action.”  <em>Valley Forge Christian College</em> v. <em>Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"454 U. S. 464\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/454/464\">454 U.&nbsp;S. 464</a>, 472 (1982).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Facial challenges disrupt the adversarial system and increase the risk of judicial error as a result.  A plaintiff raising a facial challenge need not have any direct knowledge of how the statute applies to others.  In fact, since a facial challenge may be brought before a statute has been enforced against anyone, a plaintiff often can only guess how the statute operates—even in his own case.  For this reason, “[c]laims of facial invalidity often rest on speculation,” <em>Washington State Grange</em>, 552 U.&nbsp;S., at 450, and “factually barebones records,” <em>Sabri</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"541 U. S. 600\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/541/600\">541 U.&nbsp;S. 600</a>, 609 (2004).  Federal courts are often called to give “prema&nbsp;ture interpretations of statutes in areas where their constitutional application might be cloudy.”  <em>Raines</em>, 362 U.&nbsp;S., at 22.  In short, facial challenges ask courts to resolve potentially thorny constitutional questions with little factual background and briefing by a party who may not be affected by the outcome.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">C</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The problems with facial challenges are particularly evident in the two cases before us.  Even though the trade associations challenge two state laws, the state actors have been left out of the picture.  State officials had no opportunity to tailor the laws’ enforcement.  Nor could the legislatures amend the statutes before they were preliminarily enjoined.  In addition, neither set of state courts had a chance to interpret their own State’s law or “accord [that] law a limiting construction to avoid constitutional questions.”  <em>Washington State Grange</em>, 552 U.&nbsp;S., at 450.  Instead, federal courts construed these novel state laws in the first instance.  And, they did so with little factual record to assist them.  The trade associations’ reliance on our questionable associational-standing doctrine is partially to blame.<a aria-label=\"reference 2 of Thomas Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_7-2\" id=\"CONCUR_7-2ref\"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a>  But, the fact that the trade associations raise facial challenges has undeniably played a significant role.  With &nbsp;even simple fact patterns, a court has little chance of determining whether a novel, never-before-enforced state law can be constitutionally enforced against nonparties without resorting to mere speculation.  For cases such as these, where the constitutional analysis depends on complex, fact-specific questions, the task becomes impossible.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">D</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Facial challenges are particularly suspect given their origins.  They appear to be the product of two doctrines that are themselves constitutionally questionable, vagueness and overbreadth.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> At the time of the founding, it was well understood that federal courts could hold a statute unconstitutional only insofar as necessary to resolve a particular case or controversy.  See <em>supra</em>, at 5–6.  The Founders were certainly familiar with alternative systems that provided for the free-floating review of duly enacted statutes.  For example, the New York Constitution of 1777 created a Council of Revision, composed of the Governor, Chancellor, and New York Supreme Court.  See <em>Hansen</em>, 599 U.&nbsp;S., at 786 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas</span>, J., concurring).  The Council of Revision could object to “any measure of a [prospective] bill” based on “not only [its] constitutionality .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but also [its] policy.”  <em>Id</em>., at 787.  If the Council lodged an objection, the Legislature’s only options were to “conform to [the Council’s] objections, override them by a two-thirds vote of both Houses, or simply let the bill die.”  <em>Ibid.</em> (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In our Constitution, the Founders refused to create a council of revision or involve the Federal Judiciary in the business of reviewing statutes in the abstract.  “Despite the support of respected delegates .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the Convention voted against creating a federal council of revision on four different occasions.  No other proposal was considered and rejected so many times.”  <em>Id</em>., at 789 (citation omitted).  Instead, the Founders created a Judiciary with “only the &nbsp;authority to resolve private disputes between particular parties, rather than matters affecting the general public.”  <em>Ibid. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).  They considered judges “of all men the most unfit to have a veto on laws before their enactment.”  <em>Ibid</em>. (internal quotation marks omitted).  Therefore, they refused to enlist judges in the business of reviewing statutes other than “as an issue for decision in a concrete case or controversy.”<a aria-label=\"reference 3 of Thomas Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_7-3\" id=\"CONCUR_7-3ref\"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></a> <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> For more than a century following the founding, the Court generally adhered to the original understanding of the narrow scope of judicial review.  When the Court first discussed the concept of judicial review in <em>Marbury </em>v. <em>Madison</em>, it made clear that such review is limited to what is necessary for resolving “a particular cas[e]” before a court.  1 Cranch, at 177; see also <em>supra</em>, at 5–6.  And, in case after case that followed <em>Marbury</em>, the Court reiterated that federal courts have no authority to reach beyond the parties before them to facially invalidate a statute.<a aria-label=\"reference 4 of Thomas Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_7-4\" id=\"CONCUR_7-4ref\"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; As best I can tell, the Court’s first departure from those principles was the development of the vagueness doctrine.  See <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"576 U. S. 591\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/576/591\">576 U.&nbsp;S. 591</a>, 616–620 (2015) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas</span>, J., concurring in judgment) (describing history of vagueness doctrine).  Before and at the time of the founding, American and English courts dealt with vague laws by “simply refus[ing] to apply them in individual cases.”  <em>Id</em>., at 615.  After the unfortunate rise of “substantive” due process, however, American courts began striking down statutes wholesale as “unconstitutionally indefinite.”  <em>Id</em>., at<em> </em>617.  This Court first adopted that approach in 1914, see <em>International Harvester Co. of America</em> v. <em>Kentucky</em>, <a aria-label=\"234 U. S. 216\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/234/216\">234 U.&nbsp;S. 216</a>, and has since repeatedly used the vagueness doctrine “to strike down democratically enacted laws” in the name of substantive due process, <em>Sessions</em> v. <em>Dimaya</em>, <a aria-label=\"584 U. S. 148\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/584/148\">584 U.&nbsp;S. 148</a>, 210 (2018) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas</span>, J., dissenting); see <em>Johnson</em>, 576 U.&nbsp;S., at 618–621 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas</span>, J.).  As I have explained, I doubt that “our practice of striking down stat&nbsp;utes as unconstitutionally vague is consistent with the original meaning of the Due Process Clause.”  <em>Dimaya</em>, 584 U.&nbsp;S., at 206 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas</span>, J.); see <em>Johnson</em>, 576 U.&nbsp;S., at 622 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas</span>, J.).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The vagueness doctrine was the direct ancestor of one subset of modern facial challenges, the overbreadth doctrine.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Sineneng-Smith</em>, <a aria-label=\"590 U. S. 371\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/590/371\">590 U.&nbsp;S. 371</a>, 385 (2020) (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas</span>, J., concurring) (noting that the overbreadth doctrine “developed as a result of the vagueness doctrine’s application in the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> context”).  In <em>Thornhill</em> v. <em>Alabama</em>, <a aria-label=\"310 U.S. 88\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/310/88\">310 U.&nbsp;S. 88 (1940)</a>, the Court deemed an antipicketing statute “invalid on its face” due to its “sweeping proscription of freedom of discussion.”  <em>Id.,</em> at 101–106.  The <em>Thornhill </em>Court did so “[w]ithout considering whether the defendant’s actual conduct was entitled to <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> protection,” instead invalidating the law because it “&nbsp;‘swept within its ambit .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. activities that in ordinary circumstances constitute an exercise of freedom of speech or of the press.’&nbsp;”  <em>Sineneng-Smith</em>, 590 U.&nbsp;S., at 383 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas</span>, J.) (quoting<em> Thornhill</em>, 310 U.&nbsp;S., at 97; alteration omitted).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Thornhill</em>’s approach quickly gained traction in the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> context.  In the years to follow, the Court “invoked [its] rationale to facially invalidate a wide range of laws” concerning <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> rights—a practice that became known as the overbreadth doctrine.  <em>Sineneng-Smith</em>, 590 U.&nbsp;S., at 383.  Under that doctrine, a court can invalidate a statute if it “prohibits a substantial amount of protected speech,” “relative to the statute’s plainly legitimate sweep.”<a aria-label=\"reference 5 of Thomas Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_7-5\" id=\"CONCUR_7-5ref\"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup></a> <em>Williams</em>, 553 U.&nbsp;S., at 292.  The Court has never attempted to ground the overbreadth doctrine “in the &nbsp;text or history of the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>.”  <em>Sineneng-Smith</em>, 590 U.&nbsp;S., at 384 (opinion of <span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas</span>, J.).  Instead, the Court has supplied only “policy considerations and value judgments.”  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The overbreadth and vagueness doctrines’ method of facial invalidation eventually spread to other areas of law, setting in motion our modern facial challenge doctrine.  For several decades after <em>Thornhill</em>, the Court continued to resist the broad use of facial challenges.  For example, in <em>Broadrick</em> v. <em>Oklahoma</em>, <a aria-label=\"413 U.S. 601\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/413/601\">413 U.&nbsp;S. 601 (1973)</a>, the Court emphasized that “[c]onstitutional judgments, as Mr. Chief Justice Marshall recognized, are justified only out of the necessity of adjudicating rights in particular cases between the litigants brought before the Court.”  <em>Id.,</em> at 611.  In that vein, the Court characterized “facial overbreadth adjudication [as] an exception to our traditional rules of practice.”  <em>Id</em>., at 615.  But, the Court eventually entertained facial challenges more broadly where a plaintiff established that “no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.”&nbsp;<a aria-label=\"reference 6 of Thomas Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_7-6\" id=\"CONCUR_7-6ref\"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup></a> <em>Salerno</em>, 481 U.&nbsp;S., at 745.  Just as with the overbreadth doctrine, the Court has yet to explain how facial challenges are consistent with the Constitution’s text or history.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Given how our facial challenge doctrine seems to have developed—with one doctrinal mistake leading to another—it is no wonder that facial challenges create a host of constitutional and practical issues.  See <em>supra</em>, at 6–13.  Rather than perpetuate our mistakes, the Court should end them.  “No principle is more fundamental to the judiciary’s proper role in our system of government than the constitutional &nbsp;limitation of federal-court jurisdiction to actual cases or controversies.”  <em>Simon</em> v. <em>Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization</em>, <a aria-label=\"426 U. S. 26\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/426/26\">426 U.&nbsp;S. 26</a>, 37 (1976).  Because that requirement precludes courts from judging and enjoining statutes as applied to nonparties, the Court should discontinue the practice of facial challenges.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">*  *  *</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The Court has recognized the problems that facial challenges pose, emphasizing that they are “disfavored,” <em>Washington State Grange</em>, 552 U.&nbsp;S., at 450, and “best when infrequent,” <em>Sabri</em>, 541 U.&nbsp;S., at 608.  The Court reiterates those sentiments today.  <em>Ante,</em> at 9, 30.  But, while sidelining facial challenges provides some measure of relief, it ignores the real problem.  Because federal courts are bound by Article III’s case-or-controversy requirement, holding a statute unconstitutional as applied to nonparties is not simply disfavored—it exceeds the authority granted to federal courts.  It is high time the Court reconsiders its facial challenge doctrine.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<h3 class=\"fnheader\">Notes</h3>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"CONCUR_7-1\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Thomas Concurrence at reference 1\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#CONCUR_7-1ref\">1</a> &nbsp;This is not to say that federal courts can never adjudicate a constitutional claim if a plaintiff styles it as a facial challenge.  Whenever a plaintiff alleges a statute is unconstitutional in many or all of its applications, that argument nearly always includes an allegation that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to the plaintiff.  Federal courts are free to consider challenged statutes as applied to the plaintiff before them and limit any relief accordingly.  See generally <em>Americans</em> <em>for Prosperity Foundation</em> v. <em>Bonta</em>, <a aria-label=\"594 U. S. 595\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/594/595\">594 U.&nbsp;S. 595</a>, 618–619 (2021); <em>id</em>., at 621 (<span class=\"smallcaps\">Thomas</span>, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"CONCUR_7-2\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Thomas Concurrence at reference 2\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#CONCUR_7-2ref\">2</a> &nbsp;The trade associations do not allege that they are subject to H.&nbsp;B. 20 and S.&nbsp;B. 7072, but have brought suit to vindicate the rights of their members.  There is thus not a single party in these suits that is actually regulated by the challenged statutes and can explain how specific provisions will infringe on their <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> rights.  Instead, the trade associations assert their understanding of how the challenged statutes will regulate nonparties.As I have recently explained, “[a]ssociational standing raises constitutional concerns.”  See <em>FDA</em> v. <em>Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine</em>, <a aria-label=\"602 U. S. 367\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/602/367\">602 U.&nbsp;S. 367</a>, 399 (2024) (concurring opinion).  Associational standing appears to conflict with Article III’s injury and redressability requirements in many of the same ways as facial challenges.  I have serious doubts that either trade association has standing to vicariously assert a member’s injury.  See <em>id</em>., at 400.</p>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"CONCUR_7-3\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Thomas Concurrence at reference 3\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#CONCUR_7-3ref\">3</a> &nbsp;“The later history of the New York Council of Revision demonstrates the wisdom of the Framers’ decision.”  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Hansen</em>, <a aria-label=\"599 U.

Everything else in the opinion of the Court is nonbinding dicta.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> I agree with the bottom line of the majority’s central holding.  But its description of the Florida and Texas laws, as well as the litigation that shaped the question before us, leaves much to be desired.  Its summary of our legal precedents is incomplete.  And its broader ambition of providing guidance on whether one part of the Texas law is unconstitutional as applied to two features of two of the many platforms that it reaches—namely, Facebook’s News Feed and YouTube’s homepage—is unnecessary and unjustified.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> But given the incompleteness of this record, there is no &nbsp;need and no good reason to decide anything other than the facial unconstitutionality question actually before us.  After all, we do not know how the platforms “moderate” their users’ content, much less whether they do so in an inherently expressive way under the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>.  Nevertheless, the majority is undeterred.  It inexplicably singles out a few provisions and a couple of platforms for special treatment.  And it unreflectively assumes the truth of NetChoice’s unsupported assertion that social-media platforms—which use secret algorithms to review and moderate an almost unimaginable quantity of data today—are just as expressive as the newspaper editors who marked up typescripts in blue pencil 50 years ago.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> These as-applied issues are important, and we may have to decide them before too long.  But these cases do not provide the proper occasion to do so.  For these reasons, I am therefore compelled to provide a more complete discussion of those matters than is customary in an opinion that concurs only in the judgment.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">I</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> As the Court has recognized, social-media platforms have become the “modern public square.”  <em>Packingham </em>v. <em>North Carolina</em>, <a aria-label=\"582 U. S. 98\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/582/98\">582 U.&nbsp;S. 98</a>, 107 (2017).  In just a few years, they have transformed the way in which millions of Americans communicate with family and friends, perform daily chores, conduct business, and learn about and comment on current events.  The vast majority of Americans use social media,<a aria-label=\"reference 1 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-1\" id=\"CONCUR_8-1ref\"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a> and the average person spends more than two hours a day on various platforms.<a aria-label=\"reference 2 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-2\" id=\"CONCUR_8-2ref\"><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></a>  Young people now turn primarily to &nbsp;social media to get the news,<a aria-label=\"reference 3 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-3\" id=\"CONCUR_8-3ref\"><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></a> and for many of them, life without social media is unimaginable.<a aria-label=\"reference 4 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-4\" id=\"CONCUR_8-4ref\"><sup><strong>4</strong></sup></a>  Social media may provide many benefits—but not without drawbacks.  For example, some research suggests that social media are having a devastating effect on many young people, leading to depression, isolation, bullying, and intense pressure to endorse the trend or cause of the day.<a aria-label=\"reference 5 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-5\" id=\"CONCUR_8-5ref\"><sup><strong>5</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In light of these trends, platforms and governments have implemented measures to minimize the harms unique to the social-media context.  Social-media companies have created user guidelines establishing the kinds of content that users may post and the consequences of violating those guidelines, which often include removing nonconforming posts or restricting noncompliant users’ access to a platform.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Such enforcement decisions can sometimes have serious consequences.  Restricting access to social media can impair users’ ability to speak to, learn from, and do business with others.  Deleting the account of an elected official or candidate for public office may seriously impair that individual’s efforts to reach constituents or voters, as well as the ability of voters to make a fully informed electoral choice.  And what platforms call “content moderation” of the news or user comments on public affairs can have a substantial effect on popular views.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; Concerned that social-media platforms could abuse their enormous power, Florida and Texas enacted laws that prohibit them from disfavoring particular viewpoints and speakers.  See S.&nbsp;B. 7072, 2021 Reg. Sess., §1(9) (Fla. 2021) (finding that “[s]ocial media platforms have unfairly censored .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Floridians”); H.&nbsp;B. 20, 87th Leg., Called Sess. (Tex. 2021) (prohibiting the “censorship of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. expression on social media platforms” in Texas).  Both statutes have a broad reach, and it is impossible to determine whether they are unconstitutional in all their applications without surveying those applications.  The majority, however, provides only a cursory outline of the relevant provisions of these laws and the litigation challenging their constitutionality.  To remedy this deficiency, I will begin with a more complete summary.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">A</h3>\n<h4 class=\"jy-center\">1</h4>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> I start with Florida’s law, S.&nbsp;B. 7072, which regulates any internet platform that does “business in the state” and has either “annual gross revenues in excess of $100 million” or “at least 100 million monthly individual platform participants globally.”  Fla. Stat. §501.2041(1)(g) (2023).  This definition is broad.  There is no dispute that it covers large &nbsp;social-networking websites like Facebook, X, YouTube, and Instagram, but it may also reach e-commerce and other non-social-networking websites that allow users to leave reviews, ask and answer questions, or communicate with others online.  These may include Uber, Etsy, PayPal, Yelp, Wikipedia, and Gmail.  See, <em>e.g.</em>,<em> </em>Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 22–555, pp. 54–56, 69, 76–79, 155; Brief for Wikimedia Foundation as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 6; Brief for Yelp Inc. as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 4, n.&nbsp;4.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> To prevent covered platforms from unfairly treating &nbsp;Floridians, S.&nbsp;B. 7072 imposes the following “content-&nbsp;moderation” and disclosure requirements:</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; <em>Content-moderation provisions</em>.  “Content moderation” is the gentle-sounding term used by internet platforms to denote actions they take purportedly to ensure that user-&nbsp;provided content complies with their terms of service and “community standards.”  The Florida law eschews this neologism and instead uses the old-fashioned term “censorship.”  To prevent platforms from discriminating against certain views or speakers, that law requires each regulated platform to enforce its “censorship .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. standards in a consistent manner among its users on the platform.”  Fla. Stat. §501.2041(2)(b).  The law defines “censorship” as any action taken to: “delete, regulate, restrict, edit, alter, [or] inhibit” users from posting their own content; “post an addendum to any content or material posted by a user”; or “inhibit the ability of a user to be viewable by or to interact with another user.”  §501.2041(1)(b).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> To prevent platforms from attempting to evade this restriction by regularly modifying their practices, the law prohibits platforms from changing their censorship “rules, terms, and agreements .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. more than once every 30 days.”  §501.2041(2)(c).  And to give Floridians more control over how they view content on social-media websites, the law requires each platform to give its users the ability to “opt out” of its content-sorting “algorithms” and instead view posts sequentially or chronologically. <em> </em>§501.2041(2)(f&nbsp;).<a aria-label=\"reference 6 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-6\" id=\"CONCUR_8-6ref\"><sup><strong>6</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Although some platforms still have employees who monitor and organize social-media feeds, for most platforms, “the incredible volume of content shared each day makes human review of each new post impossible.”  Brief for Developers Alliance et al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 4.  Consequently, platforms rely heavily on algorithms to organize and censor content.  <em>Ibid.  </em>And it is likely that they will increasingly &nbsp;rely on artificial intelligence (AI), a machine learning tool that arranges, deletes, and modifies content and learns from its own choices.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In addition to barring censorship, the Florida law attempts to prevent platforms from unfairly influencing elections or distorting public discourse.  To do this, it requires platforms to host candidates for public office and journalistic enterprises.<a aria-label=\"reference 7 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-7\" id=\"CONCUR_8-7ref\"><sup><strong>7</strong></sup></a>  §§501.2041(2)(h), (j).  For the same reasons, the law also prohibits platforms from censoring posts made by or about candidates for public office.  §501.2041(2)(h).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"><em> Disclosure provisions</em>.  S.&nbsp;B. 7072 requires platforms to make both general and individual disclosures about how and when they censor the speech of Floridians.  The law requires platforms to publish their content-moderation standards and to inform users of any changes.  §§501.2041(2)(a), (c).  And whenever a platform censors a user, S.&nbsp;B. 7072 requires it to: (1)&nbsp;notify the user of the censorship decision in writing within seven days; (2)&nbsp;provide “a thorough” explanation of the action and how the platform became aware of the affected content; and (3)&nbsp;allow the user “to access or retrieve all of the user’s information, &nbsp;content, material, and data for at least 60 days.”  §§501.2041(2)(d), (i), (3).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> To ensure compliance with these provisions, S.&nbsp;B. 7072 authorizes the Florida attorney general to bring civil and administrative actions against noncomplying platforms.  &nbsp;§501.2041(5).  The law allows the Florida Elections Commission to fine platforms that fail to host candidates for public office.  Fla. Stat. §106.072(3) (2023).  And the law permits aggrieved users to sue and recover up to $100,000 for each violation of the content-moderation and disclosure provisions, along with actual damages, equitable relief, punitive damages, and attorney’s fees.  §501.2041(6).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> To protect platforms, the law provides that it “may only be enforced to the extent not inconsistent with federal law,” including §203 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996.  §501.2041(9).  Section 230(c)(2)(A) of that Act shields internet platforms from liability for voluntary, good-faith efforts to restrict or remove content that is “obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable.”  <a aria-label=\"47 USC 230 c 2 A\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230#c_2_A\">47 U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. §230(c)(2)(A)</a>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">2</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Days after S.&nbsp;B. 7072’s enactment, NetChoice filed suit in federal court, alleging that the new law violates the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> in all its applications.<a aria-label=\"reference 8 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-8\" id=\"CONCUR_8-8ref\"><sup><strong>8</strong></sup></a>  As a result, NetChoice asked the District Court to enter a preliminary injunction against any enforcement of any of its provisions before the law took effect.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Florida defended the constitutionality of S.&nbsp;B. 7072.  It argued that the law’s prohibition of censorship does not violate the freedom of speech because the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> permits the regulation of the conduct of entities that do not express their own views but simply provide the means for others to communicate.  See Record in No. 4:21–CV–00220 &nbsp;(ND Fla.), Doc. 106, p. 22 (citing <em>Rumsfeld</em> v. <em>Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"547 U. S. 47\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/547/47\">547 U.&nbsp;S. 47</a>, 64 (2006) (<em>FAIR</em>)).  And, in any event, Florida argued that NetChoice’s facial challenge was likely to fail at the threshold because NetChoice had not identified which of its members were required to comply with the new law or how each of its members’ presentation of third-party speech expressed that platform’s own message.  Record, Doc. 106, at 30, 58–59; <em>id</em>., Doc. 118, pp.&nbsp;5, 24–25.  Without this information, Florida said, it could not properly respond to NetChoice’s facial claim.  <em>Id</em>., Doc. 122, pp.&nbsp;4–5.  Florida requested a “meaningful opportunity to take discovery.”  Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 22–277, p.&nbsp;154.  NetChoice objected.  Record, Doc. 122.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Despite these arguments, the District Court enjoined S.&nbsp;B. 7072 in its entirety before the law could go into effect.  Florida appealed, maintaining, among other things, that NetChoice was “unlikely to prevail on the merits of [its] facial <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> challenge.”  Brief for Appellants in No. 21–12355 (CA11), p. 20; Reply Brief in No. 21–12355 (CA11), p. 15.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> With just one exception, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.  It first held that <em>all</em> the regulated platforms’ decisions about “whether, to what extent, and in what manner to disseminate third-party created content to the public” were constitutionally protected expression.  <em>NetChoice </em>v.<em> Attorney Gen., Fla.</em>, 34 F.&nbsp;4th 1196, 1212 (2022).  Under that framing, the court found that the moderation and individual-&nbsp;disclosure provisions likely failed intermediate scrutiny, obviating the need to determine whether strict scrutiny applied.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1227.<a aria-label=\"reference 9 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-9\" id=\"CONCUR_8-9ref\"><sup><strong>9</strong></sup></a>  But the court held that the general-&nbsp;disclosure provisions, which require only that platforms publish their censorship policies, met the intermediate-scrutiny standard set forth in <em>Zauderer </em>v.  <em>Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio</em>, <a aria-label=\"471 U.S. 626\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/471/626\">471 U. S. 626 (1985)</a>.  34 F.&nbsp;4th, at 1230.  The Eleventh Circuit therefore vacated the portion of the District Court’s order that enjoined the enforcement of those general-disclosure provisions, while affirming all the rest of the injunction.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1231.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">B</h3>\n<h4 class=\"jy-center\">1</h4>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Around the same time as the enactment of the Florida law, Texas adopted a similar measure, H.&nbsp;B. 20, which covers “social media platform[s]” with more than 50 million monthly users in the United States.  Tex. Bus. &amp; Com. Code Ann. §120.002(b) (West 2023).  The statute defines a “&nbsp;‘[s]ocial media platform’&nbsp;” as an “[i]nternet website or application that is open to the public, allows a user to create an account, and enables users to communicate with other users for the primary purpose of posting information, comments, messages, or images.”  §120.001(l).  Unlike Florida’s broader law, however, Texas’s statute does not cover &nbsp;internet-service providers, email providers, and websites that “consis[t] primarily of news, sports, entertainment, or other information or content that is not user generated but is preselected by the provider.”  §120.001(1)(C)(i).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> To ensure “the free exchange of ideas and information,” H.&nbsp;B. 20 requires regulated platforms to abide by the following content-moderation and disclosure requirements.  Act of Sept. 2, 2021, 87th Leg., 2d Called Sess., ch. 3.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Content-moderation provisions</em>.  H.&nbsp;B. 20 prevents social-media companies from “censoring” users—that is, acting to “block, ban, remove, deplatform, demonetize, de-boost, restrict, deny equal access or visibility to, or otherwise discriminate against”—based on their viewpoint or geographic &nbsp;location within Texas.<a aria-label=\"reference 10 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-10\" id=\"CONCUR_8-10ref\"><sup><strong>10</strong></sup></a>,<a aria-label=\"reference 11 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-11\" id=\"CONCUR_8-11ref\"><sup><strong>11</strong></sup></a>,<a aria-label=\"reference 12 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-12\" id=\"CONCUR_8-12ref\"><sup><strong>12</strong></sup></a>  Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. §§143A.001(1), 143A.002(a)(1)–(3) (West Cum. Supp. 2023).  However, the law allows platforms to censor speech that: federal law “specifically authorize[s]” them to censor; speech that the platform is told sexually exploits children or survivors of sexual abuse; speech that “directly incites criminal activity or consists of specific threats of violence targeted against a person or group because of race, color, disability, religion, national origin or ancestry, age, sex or status as peace officer or judge”; and speech that is otherwise unlawful or has been the subject of a user’s request for removal from his or her feed or profile.  §§143A.006(a)–(b).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> <em>Disclosure provisions</em>.  Like the Florida law, H.&nbsp;B. 20 also requires platforms to make general and individual disclosures about their censorship practices.  Specifically, the law obligates each platform to tell the public how it “targets,” “promotes,” and “moderates” content.  §§120.051(a)(1)–(3).  And whenever a platform censors a user, the law requires it to inform the user why that was done.  §120.103(a)(1).<a aria-label=\"reference 13 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-13\" id=\"CONCUR_8-13ref\"><sup><strong>13</strong></sup></a>  &nbsp;Platforms must allow users to appeal removal decisions through “an easily accessible complaint system;” resolve such appeals within 14 business days (unless an enumerated exception applies); and, if the appeal is successful, provide “the reason for the reversal.”  §§120.101, 120.103(a)(2), (a)(3)(B)–(b), 120.104.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"><em> </em>Users may sue any platform that violates these provisions, as may the Texas attorney general.  §143A.007(d).  But unlike the Florida law, H.&nbsp;B. 20 authorizes only injunctive relief.  §§143A.007(a), 143A.008.  It contains a strong severability provision, §8(a), which reaches “every provision, section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or word in th[e] Act, and every application of [its] provisions.”</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">2</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> As it did in the Florida case, NetChoice sought a preliminary injunction in federal court, claiming that H.&nbsp;B. 20 violates the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> in its entirety.  In response, Texas argued that because H.&nbsp;B. 20 regulates NetChoice’s members “in their operation as publicly accessible conduits for the speech of others” rather than “as authors or editors” of their own speech, NetChoice could not prevail.  Record in No. 1:21–CV–00840 (WD Tex.), Doc. 39, p.&nbsp;23.  But even if the platforms might have the right to use algorithms to censor their users’ speech, the State argued, the question of “<em>what</em> these algorithms are doing is a critical, and so far, unexplained, aspect of this case.”  <em>Id</em>., at 24.  This deficiency mattered, Texas contended, because the platforms could succeed  on their facial challenge only by showing that “<em>all</em> algorithms used by the Platforms are for the purposes of expressing viewpoints of those Platforms.”  <em>Id.,</em> at 27.  And because NetChoice had not even explained what its members’ algorithms did, much less whether they did so in an expressive way, Texas argued that NetChoice had not shown that “all applications of H.B. 20 are unconstitutional.”  <em>Ibid.</em>; see also <em>id</em>., Doc. 53, at 13 (arguing that &nbsp;NetChoice had failed to show that “H.&nbsp;B. 20 is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. unconstitutional in all its applications” because “a number” of NetChoice’s members had conceded that the law did “<em>not</em> burden or chill their speech”).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> To clarify these and other “threshold issues,” Texas moved for expedited discovery.  <em>Id</em>., Doc. 20, at 1.  The District Court granted Texas’s motion in part, but after one month of discovery, it sided with NetChoice and enjoined H.&nbsp;B. 20 in its entirety before it could go into effect.  Texas appealed, arguing that despite the District Court’s judgment to the contrary, “[l]aws requiring commercial entities to neutrally host speakers generally do not even implicate the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> because they do not regulate the host’s speech at all—they regulate its conduct.”  Brief for Appellant in No. 21–51178 (CA5), p. 16.  The State also emphasized NetChoice’s alleged failure to show that H.&nbsp;B. 20 was unconstitutional in even a “&nbsp;‘substantial number of its applications,’&nbsp;” the “bare minimum” showing that NetChoice needed to make to prevail on its facial challenge.  <em>E.g.,</em> Reply Brief in No. 21–51178 (CA5), p. 8 (quoting <em>Americans for Prosperity Foundation </em>v.<em> Bonta</em>, <a aria-label=\"594 U. S. 595\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/594/595\">594 U.&nbsp;S. 595</a>, 615 (2021)).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> A divided Fifth Circuit panel reversed, focusing primarily on NetChoice’s failure to “even try to show that HB 20 is ‘unconstitutional in all of its applications.’&nbsp;”  49 F.&nbsp;4th 439, 449 (2022) (quoting <em>Washington State Grange</em> v. <em>Washington State Republican Party</em>, <a aria-label=\"552 U. S. 442\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/552/442\">552 U.&nbsp;S. 442</a>, 449 (2008)).  The court also accepted Texas’s argument that H.&nbsp;B. 20 “does not regulate the Platforms’ speech at all” because “the Platforms are not ‘speaking’ when they host other people’s speech.”  49 F.&nbsp;4th, at 448.  Finally, the court upheld the law’s disclosure requirements on the ground that they involve the disclosure of the type of purely factual and uncontroversial information that may be compelled under <em>Zauderer</em>.  49 F. 4th, at 485.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">&nbsp;II</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> NetChoice contends that the Florida and Texas statutes facially violate the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>, meaning that they cannot be applied to anyone at any time under any circumstances without violating the Constitution.  Such challenges are strongly disfavored.  See <em>Washington State Grange</em>, 552 U.&nbsp;S., at 452.  They often raise the risk of “&nbsp;‘premature interpretatio[n] of statutes’ on the basis of factually barebones records.”  <em>Sabri </em>v.<em> United States</em>, <a aria-label=\"541 U. S. 600\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/541/600\">541 U.&nbsp;S. 600</a>, 609 (2004).  They clash with the principle that courts should neither “&nbsp;‘anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it’&nbsp;” nor “&nbsp;‘formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.’&nbsp;” <em>Ashwander </em>v.<em> TVA</em>, <a aria-label=\"297 U. S. 288\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/297/288\">297 U.&nbsp;S. 288</a>, 346–347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).  And they “threaten to short circuit the democratic process by preventing laws embodying the will of the people from being implemented in a manner consistent with the Constitution.”  <em>Washington State Grange</em>, 552 U.&nbsp;S., at 451.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Facial challenges also strain the limits of the federal courts’ constitutional authority to decide only actual “Cases” and “Controversies.”  Art. III, §2.  “[L]itigants typically lack standing to assert the constitutional rights of third parties.”  <em>United States </em>v.<em> Hansen</em>, <a aria-label=\"599 U. S. 762\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/599/762\">599 U.&nbsp;S. 762</a>, 769 (2023).  But when a court holds that a law cannot be enforced against anyone under any circumstances, it effectively grants relief with respect to unknown parties in disputes that have not yet materialized.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> For these reasons, we have insisted that parties mounting facial attacks satisfy demanding requirements.  In <em>United States</em> v. <em>Salerno</em>, <a aria-label=\"481 U. S. 739\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/481/739\">481 U.&nbsp;S. 739</a>, 745 (1987), we held that a facial challenger must “establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the [law] would be valid.”  “While some Members of the Court have criticized the <em>Salerno</em> formulation,” all have agreed “that a facial challenge must fail where the statute has a “&nbsp;‘plainly legitimate &nbsp;sweep.”&nbsp;’&nbsp;”  <em>Washington State Grange</em>, 552 U.&nbsp;S., at 449.  In <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> cases, we have sometimes phrased the requirement as an obligation to show that a law “&nbsp;‘prohibits a substantial amount of protected speech’&nbsp;” relative to its ‘&nbsp;“plainly legitimate sweep.’&nbsp;”  <em>Hansen</em>, 599 U.&nbsp;S., at 770; <em>Bonta</em>, 594 U.&nbsp;S., at 615; <em>United States </em>v.<em> Williams</em>, <a aria-label=\"553 U. S. 285\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/553/285\">553 U.&nbsp;S. 285</a>, 292–293 (2008).<a aria-label=\"reference 14 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-14\" id=\"CONCUR_8-14ref\"><sup><strong>14</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> NetChoice and the Federal Government urge us not to apply any of these demanding tests because, they say, the States disputed only the “threshold question” whether their laws “cover expressive activity at all.”  Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 22–277, at 76; see also <em>id.,</em> at 84, 125; Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 22–555, at 92.  The Court unanimously rejects that argument—and for good reason.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> First, the States did<em> not </em>“put all their eggs in [one] basket.”  Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 22–277, at 76.  To be sure, they argued that their newly enacted laws were valid in all their applications.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Both the Federal Government and the States almost always defend the constitutionality of all provisions of their laws.  But Florida and Texas did not stop there.  Rather, as noted above, they went on to argue that NetChoice had failed to make the showing required for a facial challenge.<a aria-label=\"reference 15 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-15\" id=\"CONCUR_8-15ref\"><sup><strong>15</strong></sup></a>  Therefore, the record does not support &nbsp;NetChoice’s attempt to use “the party presentation rules” as grounds for blocking our consideration of the question whether it  satisfied the facial constitutionality test.  Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 22–555, at 92.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Second, even if the States had not asked the lower courts to reject NetChoice’s request for blanket relief, it would have been improper for those courts to enjoin all applications of the challenged laws unless that test was met.  “It is one thing to allow parties to forfeit claims, defenses, or lines of argument; it would be quite another to allow parties to stipulate or bind [a court] to the application of an incorrect legal standard.”  <em>Gardner </em>v.<em> Galetka</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/568_F.3d_862\">568 F.&nbsp;3d 862</a>, 879 (CA10 2009); see also <em>Kairys </em>v.<em> Southern Pines Trucking, Inc</em>., 75 F.&nbsp;4th 153, 160 (CA3 2023) (“But parties cannot forfeit the application of ‘controlling law’&nbsp;”); <em>United States </em>v.<em> Escobar</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/866_F.3d_333\">866 F.&nbsp;3d 333</a>, 339, n. 13 (CA5 2017) (<em>per curiam</em>) (“&nbsp;‘A party cannot waive, concede, or abandon the applicable standard of review’&nbsp;” (quoting <em>Ward </em>v.<em> Stephens</em>, <a href=\"/rio/citation/777_F.3d_250\">777 F.&nbsp;3d 250</a>, 257, n. 3 (CA5 2015)).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Represented by sophisticated counsel, NetChoice made the deliberate choice to mount a facial challenge to both laws, and in doing so, it obviously knew what it would have to show in order to prevail.  NetChoice decided to fight these laws on these terms, and the Court properly holds it to that decision.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">&nbsp;III</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> I therefore turn to the question whether NetChoice established facial unconstitutionality, and I begin with the States’ content-moderation requirements.  To show that these provisions are facially invalid, NetChoice had to demonstrate that they lack a plainly legitimate sweep under the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>.  Our precedents interpreting that Amendment provide the numerator (the number of unconstitutional applications) and denominator (the total number of possible applications) that NetChoice was required to identify in order to make that showing.  Estimating the numerator requires an understanding of the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> principles that must be applied here, and I therefore provide a brief review of those principles.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">A</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> protects “the freedom of speech,” and most of our cases interpreting this right have involved government efforts to forbid, restrict, or compel a party’s own oral or written expression.  <em>Agency for Int’l Development</em> v. <em>Alliance for Open Society Int’l, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"570 U. S. 205\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/570/205\">570 U.&nbsp;S. 205</a>, 213 (2013); <em>Wooley</em> v. <em>Maynard</em>, <a aria-label=\"430 U. S. 705\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/430/705\">430 U.&nbsp;S. 705</a>, 714 (1977); <em>West Virginia Bd. of Ed.</em> v. <em>Barnette</em>, <a aria-label=\"319 U. S. 624\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/319/624\">319 U.&nbsp;S. 624</a>, 642 (1943).  Some cases, however, have involved another aspect of the free speech right, namely, the right to “presen[t] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. an edited compilation of speech generated by other persons” for the purpose of expressing  a particular message.  See <em>Hurley</em> v. <em>Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc.</em>, <a aria-label=\"515 U. S. 557\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/515/557\">515 U.&nbsp;S. 557</a>, 570 (1995).  As used in this context, the term “compilation” means any effort to present the expression of others in some sort of organized package.  See <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> An example such as the famous Oxford Book of English Poetry<em> </em>illustrates why a compilation may constitute expression on the part of the compiler.  The editors’ selection of the poems included in this volume expresses their view &nbsp;about the poets and poems that most deserve the attention of their anticipated readers.  Forcing the editors to exclude or include a poem could alter the expression that the editors wish to convey.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Not all compilations, however, have this expressive characteristic.  Suppose that the head of a neighborhood group prepares a directory consisting of contact information submitted by all the residents who want to be listed.  This directory would not include any meaningful expression on the part of the compiler.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Because not all compilers express a message of their own, not all compilations are protected by the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a>.  Instead, the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> protects only those compilations that are “inherently expressive” in their own right, meaning that they select and present speech created by other persons in order “to spread [the compiler’s]  own message.”  <em>FAIR</em>, 547 U.&nbsp;S., at 66; <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co.</em> v. <em>Public Util. Comm’n of Cal.</em>, <a aria-label=\"475 U. S. 1\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/475/1\">475 U.&nbsp;S. 1</a>, 10 (1986) (<em>PG&amp;E</em>) (plurality opinion).  If a compilation is inherently expressive, then the compiler may have the right to refuse to accommodate a particular speaker or message.  See <em>Hurley</em>, 515 U.&nbsp;S., at 573.  But if a compilation is not inherently expressive, then the government can require the compiler to host a message or speaker because the accommodation does not amount to compelled speech.  <em>Id.</em>, at 578–581.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> To show that a hosting requirement would compel speech and thereby trigger <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> scrutiny, a claimant must generally show three things.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">1</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> First, a claimant must establish that its practice is to exercise “editorial discretion in the selection and presentation” of the content it hosts.  <em>Arkansas Ed. Television Comm’n</em> v. <em>Forbes</em>, <a aria-label=\"523 U. S. 666\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/523/666\">523 U.&nbsp;S. 666</a>, 674 (1998); <em>Hurley</em>, 515 U.&nbsp;S., at 574; <em>ante,</em> at 14.  NetChoice describes this process &nbsp;as content “curation.”  But whatever you call it, not all compilers do this, at least in a way that is inherently expressive.  Some may serve as “passive receptacle[s]” of third-party speech or as “dumb pipes”<a aria-label=\"reference 16 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-16\" id=\"CONCUR_8-16ref\"><sup><strong>16</strong></sup></a> that merely emit what they are fed.  Such entities communicate no message of their own, and accordingly, their conduct does not merit <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> protection.<a aria-label=\"reference 17 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-17\" id=\"CONCUR_8-17ref\"><sup><strong>17</strong></sup></a> <em>Miami Herald Publishing Co.</em> v. <em>Tornillo</em>, <a aria-label=\"418 U. S. 241\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/418/241\">418 U.&nbsp;S. 241</a>, 258 (1974).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Determining whether an entity should be viewed as a “curator” or a “dumb pipe” may not always be easy because different aspects of an entity’s operations may take different approaches with respect to hosting third-party speech.  The typical newspaper regulates the content and presentation of articles authored by its employees or others, <em>PG&amp;E</em>, 475 U.&nbsp;S., at 8, but that same paper might also run nearly all the classified advertisements it receives, regardless of their content and without adding any expression of its own.  Compare <em>Tornillo</em>, <a aria-label=\"418 U. S. 241\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/418/241\">418 U.&nbsp;S. 241</a>, with <em>Pittsburgh Press Co.</em> v. <em>Pittsburgh Comm’n on Human Relations</em>, <a aria-label=\"413 U.S. 376\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/413/376\">413 U.&nbsp;S. 376 (1973)</a>.  These differences may be significant for <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> purposes.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The same may be true for a parade organizer.  For example, the practice of a parade organizer may be to select the <em>groups</em> that are admitted, but not the <em>individuals</em> who are allowed to march as members of admitted groups.  <em>Hurley</em>, 515 U.&nbsp;S., at 572–574.  In such a case, each of these practices would have to be analyzed separately.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">2</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Second, the host must use the compilation of speech to express “some sort of collective point”—even if only at a fairly abstract level.  <em>Id.</em>, at 568.  Thus, a parade organizer who claims a <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> right to exclude certain groups or individuals would need to show at least that the message conveyed by the groups or individuals who are allowed to march comport with the parade’s theme.  <em>Id.,</em> at 560, 574.  A parade comprising “unrelated segments” that lumber along together willy-nilly would likely not express anything at all.  <em>Id.</em>, at 576.  And although “a narrow, succinctly articulable message is not a condition of constitutional protection,” compilations that organize the speech of others in a non-expressive way (<em>e.g.,</em> chronologically) fall “beyond the realm of expressi[on].”  <em>Id.,</em> at 569; contra, <em>ante,</em> at 17–18<em>.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Our decision in <em>PruneYard </em>illustrates this point.  In that case, the Court held that a mall could be required to host third-party speech (<em>i.e.</em>, to admit individuals who wanted to distribute handbills or solicit signatures on petitions) because the mall’s admission policy did not express any message, and because the mall was “open to the public at large.”  <em>PruneYard Shopping Center</em> v. <em>Robins</em>, <a aria-label=\"447 U. S. 74\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/447/74\">447 U.&nbsp;S. 74</a>, 83, 87–88 (1980); <em>303 Creative LLC</em> v. <em>Elenis</em>, <a aria-label=\"600 U. S. 570\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/600/570\">600 U.&nbsp;S. 570</a>, 590 (2023).  In such circumstances, we held that the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> is not implicated merely because a host objects to a particular message or viewpoint.  See <em>PG&amp;E</em>, 475 U.&nbsp;S., at 12.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">3</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Finally, a compiler must show that its “own message [is] &nbsp;affected by the speech it [is] forced to accommodate.”  <em>FAIR</em>, 547 U.&nbsp;S., at 63.  In core examples of expressive compilations, such as a book containing selected articles, chapters, stories, or poems, this requirement is easily satisfied.  But in other situations, it may be hard to identify any message that would be affected by the inclusion of particular third-party speech.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Two precedents that the majority tries to downplay, if not forget, are illustrative.  The first is <em>PruneYard</em>,<em> </em>which I have already discussed.  The <em>PruneYard </em> Court rejected the mall’s <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> claim because “[t]he views expressed by members of the public in passing out pamphlets or seeking signatures for a petition [were] not likely [to] be identified with those of the owner.”  447 U.&nbsp;S., at 87.  And if those who perused the handbills or petitions were not likely to make that connection, any message that the mall owner intended to convey would not be affected.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> The decision in <em>FAIR </em>rested on similar reasoning.  In that case, the Court did not dispute the proposition that the law schools’ refusal to host military recruiters expressed the message that the military should admit and retain gays and lesbians.  But the Court found no <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> violation because, as in <em>PruneYard</em>, it was unlikely that the views of the military recruiters “would be identified with” those of the schools themselves, and consequently, hosting the military recruiters did not “sufficiently interfere with any message of the school.”  547 U.&nbsp;S., at 64–65; contra, <em>ante</em>, at 25 (“[T]his Court has <em>never</em> hinged a compiler’s <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> protection on the risk of misattribution.”).<a aria-label=\"reference 18 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-18\" id=\"CONCUR_8-18ref\"><sup><strong>18</strong></sup></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">&nbsp;B</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> A party that challenges government interference with its curation of content cannot win without making the three-part showing just outlined, but such a showing does not guarantee victory.  To prevail, the party must go on and show that the challenged regulation of its curation practices violates the applicable level of <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> scrutiny.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Our decision in <em>Turner</em> makes that clear.  Although the television cable operators in that case made the showing needed to trigger <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> scrutiny, they did not ultimately prevail on their facial challenge to the Cable Act.<em> </em>After a remand and more than 18 months of additional factual development, the Court held that the law was adequately tailored to serve legitimate and important government interests, including “promoting the widespread dissemination of information from a multiplicity of sources.”  <em>Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, <a aria-label=\"520 U. S. 180\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/520/180\">520 U.&nbsp;S. 180</a>, 189 (1997).  Here, the States assert a similar interest in fostering a free and open marketplace of ideas.<a aria-label=\"reference 19 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-19\" id=\"CONCUR_8-19ref\"><sup><strong>19</strong></sup></a></p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">C</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> With these standards in mind, I proceed to the question &nbsp;whether the content-moderation provisions are facially valid.  For the following three reasons, NetChoice failed to meet its burden.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">1</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> First, NetChoice did not establish <em>which entities </em>the statutes cover.  This failure is critical because it is “impossible to determine whether a statute reaches too far without first knowing what the statute covers.”  <em>Williams</em>, 553 U.&nbsp;S., at 293.  When it sued Florida, NetChoice was reluctant to disclose which of its members were covered by S.&nbsp;B. 7072.  Instead, it filed declarations revealing only that the law reached “Etsy, Facebook, and YouTube.”  Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 22–277, at 32.  In this Court, NetChoice was a bit more forthcoming, representing that S.&nbsp;B. 7072 also covers In-&nbsp;stagram, X, Pinterest, Reddit, Gmail, Uber, and other &nbsp;e-commerce websites.  <em>Id.,</em> at 69, 76; Brief for Respondents in No. 22–277, at&nbsp;7, 38, 49.<a aria-label=\"reference 20 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-20\" id=\"CONCUR_8-20ref\"><sup><strong>20</strong></sup></a>  But NetChoice has still not provided a complete list.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> NetChoice was similarly reluctant to identify its affected members in the Texas case.  At first, NetChoice “represented .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that only Facebook, YouTube, and [X] are affected by the Texas law.”  Brief for Appellant in No. 21–51178 (CA5), at 1, n.&nbsp;1.  But in its brief in this Court, NetChoice told us that H.&nbsp;B. 20 also regulates “some of the Internet’s most popular websites, including Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, TikTok, Vimeo, X (formerly known as Twitter), and YouTube.”  Brief for Petitioners in No. 22–&nbsp;555, p.&nbsp;1.  And websites such as Discord,<a aria-label=\"reference 21 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-21\" id=\"CONCUR_8-21ref\"><sup><strong>21</strong></sup></a> Reddit,<a aria-label=\"reference 22 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-22\" id=\"CONCUR_8-22ref\"><sup><strong>22</strong></sup></a>  Wikipedia,<a aria-label=\"reference 23 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-23\" id=\"CONCUR_8-23ref\"><sup><strong>23</strong></sup></a> and Yelp<a aria-label=\"reference 24 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-24\" id=\"CONCUR_8-24ref\"><sup><strong>24</strong></sup></a> have filed <em>amicus </em>briefs claiming that they may be covered by both the Texas and Florida laws.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> It is a mystery how NetChoice could expect to prevail on a facial challenge without candidly disclosing the platforms that it thinks the challenged laws reach or the nature of the content moderation they practice.  Without such information, we have no way of knowing whether the laws at issue here “cover websites that engage in primarily non-&nbsp;expressive conduct.”  Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 22–277, at&nbsp;34; see also <em>id.,</em> at 126.  For example, among other things, NetChoice has not stated whether the challenged laws reach websites like WhatsApp<a aria-label=\"reference 25 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-25\" id=\"CONCUR_8-25ref\"><sup><strong>25</strong></sup></a> and Gmail,<a aria-label=\"reference 26 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-26\" id=\"CONCUR_8-26ref\"><sup><strong>26</strong></sup></a> which <em>carry</em> messages instead of <em>curating</em> them to create an independent speech product.  Both laws also appear to cover Reddit<a aria-label=\"reference 27 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-27\" id=\"CONCUR_8-27ref\"><sup><strong>27</strong></sup></a> &nbsp;and BeReal,<a aria-label=\"reference 28 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-28\" id=\"CONCUR_8-28ref\"><sup><strong>28</strong></sup></a> and websites like Parler,<a aria-label=\"reference 29 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-29\" id=\"CONCUR_8-29ref\"><sup><strong>29</strong></sup></a> which claim to engage in little or no content moderation at all.  And Florida’s law, which is even broader than Texas’s, plainly applies to e-commerce platforms like Etsy that make clear in their terms of service that they are “not a curated marketplace.”<a aria-label=\"reference 30 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-30\" id=\"CONCUR_8-30ref\"><sup><strong>30</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> In <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> terms, this means that these laws—in at least some of their applications—appear to regulate the kind of “passive receptacle[s]” of third-party speech that receive no <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> protection.  <em>Tornillo</em>, 418 U.&nbsp;S., at 258.  Given such uncertainty, it is impossible for us to determine whether these laws have a “plainly legitimate sweep.”  <em>Williams</em>, 553 U.&nbsp;S., at 292; <em>Washington State Grange</em>, 552 U.&nbsp;S., at 449.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">2</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Second, NetChoice has not established <em>what</em> kinds of content appear on all the regulated platforms, and we cannot determine whether these platforms create an “inherently expressive” compilation of third-party speech until we know what is being compiled.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> We know that social-media platforms <em>generally</em> allow their users to create accounts; send direct messages &nbsp;through private inboxes; post written messages, photos, and videos; and comment on, repost, or otherwise interact with other users’ posts.  And NetChoice acknowledges in fairly general terms that its members engage in most—though not all—of these functions.  But such generalities are insufficient.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> For one thing, the ways in which users post, send direct messages, or interact with content may differ in meaningful ways from platform to platform.  And NetChoice’s failure to account for these differences may be decisive.  To see how, consider X and Yelp.  Both platforms allow users to post comments and photos, but they differ in other respects.<a aria-label=\"reference 31 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-31\" id=\"CONCUR_8-31ref\"><sup><strong>31</strong></sup></a>  X permits users to post (or “Tweet”) on a broad range of topics because its “purpose is to serve the public conversation,”<a aria-label=\"reference 32 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-32\" id=\"CONCUR_8-32ref\"><sup><strong>32</strong></sup></a> and as a result, many elected officials use X to communicate with constituents.  Yelp, by contrast, allows users to post comments and pictures only for the purpose of advertising local businesses or providing “firsthand accounts” that reflect their “consumer experience” with businesses.<a aria-label=\"reference 33 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-33\" id=\"CONCUR_8-33ref\"><sup><strong>33</strong></sup></a>  It does not permit “rants about political ideologies, a business’s employment practices, extraordinary circumstances, or other matters that don’t address the core of the consumer experience.”<a aria-label=\"reference 34 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-34\" id=\"CONCUR_8-34ref\"><sup><strong>34</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> As this example shows, X’s content is more political than Yelp’s, and Yelp’s content is more commercial than X’s.  That difference may be significant for <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> purposes.  See <em>Pittsburgh Press</em>, <a aria-label=\"413 U. S. 376\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/413/376\">413 U.&nbsp;S. 376</a>.  But NetChoice has not developed the record on that front.  Nor &nbsp;has it shown what kinds of content appear across the diverse array of regulated platforms.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Social-media platforms are diverse, and each may be unique in potentially significant ways.  On the present record, we are ill-equipped to account for the many platform-specific features that allow users to do things like sell or purchase goods,<a aria-label=\"reference 35 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-35\" id=\"CONCUR_8-35ref\"><sup><strong>35</strong></sup></a> live-stream events,<a aria-label=\"reference 36 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-36\" id=\"CONCUR_8-36ref\"><sup><strong>36</strong></sup></a> request a ride,<a aria-label=\"reference 37 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-37\" id=\"CONCUR_8-37ref\"><sup><strong>37</strong></sup></a> arrange a date,<a aria-label=\"reference 38 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-38\" id=\"CONCUR_8-38ref\"><sup><strong>38</strong></sup></a> create a discussion forum,<a aria-label=\"reference 39 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-39\" id=\"CONCUR_8-39ref\"><sup><strong>39</strong></sup></a> wire money to friends,<a aria-label=\"reference 40 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-40\" id=\"CONCUR_8-40ref\"><sup><strong>40</strong></sup></a> play a video game,<a aria-label=\"reference 41 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-41\" id=\"CONCUR_8-41ref\"><sup><strong>41</strong></sup></a> hire an employee,<a aria-label=\"reference 42 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-42\" id=\"CONCUR_8-42ref\"><sup><strong>42</strong></sup></a> log a run,<a aria-label=\"reference 43 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-43\" id=\"CONCUR_8-43ref\"><sup><strong>43</strong></sup></a> or agree to watch a  dog.<a aria-label=\"reference 44 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-44\" id=\"CONCUR_8-44ref\"><sup><strong>44</strong></sup></a>  The challenged laws may apply differently to these different functions, which may present different <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> issues.  A court cannot invalidate the challenged laws if it has to speculate about their applications.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">3</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Third, NetChoice has not established <em>how </em>websites moderate content.  NetChoice alleges that “[c]overed websites” generally use algorithms to organize and censor content appearing in “search results, comments, or in feeds.”  Brief for Petitioners in No. 22–555, at 4, 6.  But at this stage and on this record, we have no way of confirming whether all of the regulated platforms use algorithms to organize all of their content, much less whether these algorithms are expressive.  See <em>Hurley</em>, 515 U.&nbsp;S., at 568.  Facebook and Reddit, for instance, both allow their users to post about a wide &nbsp;range of topics.<a aria-label=\"reference 45 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-45\" id=\"CONCUR_8-45ref\"><sup><strong>45</strong></sup></a>  But while Facebook uses algorithms to arrange and moderate its users’ posts, Reddit asserts that its content is moderated by Reddit users, “not by centralized algorithms.”  Brief for Reddit, Inc., as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 2.  If Reddit and other platforms entirely outsource curation to others, they can hardly claim that their compilations express their own views.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Perhaps recognizing this, NetChoice argues in passing that it cannot tell us how its members moderate content because doing so would embolden “malicious actors” and divulge “proprietary and closely held” information.  <em>E.g.,</em> Brief for Petitioners in No. 22–555, at 11.  But these harms are far from inevitable.  Various platforms already make similar disclosures—both voluntarily and to comply with the European Union’s Digital Services Act<a aria-label=\"reference 46 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-46\" id=\"CONCUR_8-46ref\"><sup><strong>46</strong></sup></a>—yet the sky has not fallen.  And on remand, NetChoice will have the opportunity to contest whether particular disclosures are necessary and whether any relevant materials should be filed under seal.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Various NetChoice members already disclose in broad strokes how they use algorithms to curate content.  Many platforms claim to use algorithms to identify and remove &nbsp;violent, obscene, sexually explicit, and false posts that violate their community guidelines.  Brief for Developers Alliance et al. as<em> Amici Curiae </em>11.  Some platforms—like X, for instance—say they use algorithms, not for the purpose of removing all nonconforming speech, but to “promot[e] counterspeech” that “presents facts to correct misstatements” or “denounces hateful or dangerous speech.”<a aria-label=\"reference 47 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-47\" id=\"CONCUR_8-47ref\"><sup><strong>47</strong></sup></a>  Still others, like Parler,<a aria-label=\"reference 48 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-48\" id=\"CONCUR_8-48ref\"><sup><strong>48</strong></sup></a> Reddit,<a aria-label=\"reference 49 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-49\" id=\"CONCUR_8-49ref\"><sup><strong>49</strong></sup></a> and Signal Messenger,<a aria-label=\"reference 50 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-50\" id=\"CONCUR_8-50ref\"><sup><strong>50</strong></sup></a> say they engage in little or no content moderation.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Some platforms have also disclosed that they use algorithms to help their users find relevant content.  The e-commerce platform Etsy, for instance, uses an algorithm that matches a user’s search terms to the “attributes” that a seller ascribes to its wares.<a aria-label=\"reference 51 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-51\" id=\"CONCUR_8-51ref\"><sup><strong>51</strong></sup></a>  Etsy’s algorithm also accounts for things like the date of the seller’s listing, the proximity of the seller and buyer, and the quality of the seller’s customer-service ratings.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> YouTube says it answers search queries based on “relevance, engagement and quality”—taking into account how well a search query matches a video title, the kinds of videos a particular user viewed in the past, and each creator’s “expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness on a given topic.”<a aria-label=\"reference 52 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-52\" id=\"CONCUR_8-52ref\"><sup><strong>52</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"><em> </em>These disclosures suggest that platforms can say something about their content-moderation practices without enabling malicious actors or disclosing proprietary information.  They also suggest that not all platforms curate all third-party content in an inherently expressive way.  Without more information about how regulated platforms moderate content, it is not possible to  determine whether these laws lack “a ‘&nbsp;“plainly legitimate sweep.”&nbsp;’&nbsp;”  <em>Washington State Grange</em>, 552 U.&nbsp;S., at 449.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> For all these reasons, NetChoice failed to establish whether the content-moderation provisions violate the <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> on their face.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">D</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Although the only question the Court must decide today is whether NetChoice showed that the Florida and Texas laws are facially unconstitutional, much of the majority opinion addresses a different question: whether the Texas law’s content-moderation provisions are constitutional as applied to two features of two platforms—Facebook’s News Feed and YouTube’s homepage.  The opinion justifies this discussion on the ground that the Fifth Circuit cannot apply the facial constitutionality test without resolving that question, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>ante,</em> at 13, 30, but that is not necessarily true.  Especially in light of the wide reach of the Texas law, NetChoice may still fall far short of establishing facial unconstitutionality—even if it is assumed for the sake of argument that the Texas law is unconstitutional as applied to Facebook’s News Feed and YouTube’s homepage.<a aria-label=\"reference 53 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-53\" id=\"CONCUR_8-53ref\"><sup><strong>53</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> For this reason, the majority’s “guidance” on this issue may well be superfluous.  Yet superfluity is not its most egregious flaw.  The majority’s discussion also rests on wholly conclusory assumptions that lack record support.  &nbsp;For example, the majority paints an attractive, though simplistic, picture of what Facebook’s News Feed and YouTube’s homepage do behind the scenes.  Taking NetChoice at its word, the majority says that the platforms’ use of algorithms to enforce their community standards is <em>per&nbsp;se</em> expressive.  But the platforms have refused to disclose how these algorithms were created and how they actually work.  And the majority fails to give any serious consideration to key arguments pressed by the States.  Most notable is the majority’s conspicuous failure to address  the States’ contention that platforms like YouTube and Facebook—which constitute the 21st century equivalent of the old “public square”—should be viewed as common carriers.  See <em>Biden </em>v.<em> Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University</em>, 593 U.&nbsp;S. ___, ___ (2021) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 6).  Whether or not the Court ultimately accepts that argument, it deserves serious treatment.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Instead of seriously engaging with this and other arguments, the majority rests on NetChoice’s dubious assertion that there is no constitutionally significant difference between what newspaper editors did more than a half-century ago at the time of <em>Tornillo </em>and what Facebook and YouTube do today.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Maybe that is right—but maybe it is not.  Before mechanically accepting this analogy, perhaps we should take a closer look.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Let’s start with size.  Currently, Facebook and YouTube each produced—on a daily basis—more than four petabytes (4,000,000,000,000,000 bytes) of data.<a aria-label=\"reference 54 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-54\" id=\"CONCUR_8-54ref\"><sup><strong>54</strong></sup></a>  By my calculation, that is roughly 1.3 billion times as many bytes as there are in an issue of the New York Times.<a aria-label=\"reference 55 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-55\" id=\"CONCUR_8-55ref\"><sup><strong>55</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; No human being could possibly review even a tiny fraction of this gigantic outpouring of speech, and it is therefore hard to see how any shared message could be discerned.  And even if someone could view all this data and find such a message, how likely is it that the addition of a small amount of discordant speech would change the overall message?</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Now consider how newspapers and social-media platforms edit content.  Newspaper editors are real human beings, and when the Court decided <em>Tornillo</em> (the case that the majority finds most instructive), editors assigned articles to particular reporters, and copyeditors went over typescript with a blue pencil.  The platforms, by contrast, play no role in selecting the billions of texts and videos that users try to convey to each other.  And the vast bulk of the “curation” and “content moderation” carried out by platforms is not done by human beings.  Instead, algorithms remove a small fraction of nonconforming posts <em>post&nbsp;hoc</em> and prioritize content based on factors that the platforms have not revealed and may not even know.  After all, many of the biggest platforms are beginning to use AI algorithms to help them moderate content.  And when AI algorithms make a decision, “even the researchers and programmers creating them don’t really understand why the models they have built make the decisions they make.”<a aria-label=\"reference 56 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-56\" id=\"CONCUR_8-56ref\"><sup><strong>56</strong></sup></a>  Are such decisions equally expressive as the decisions made by humans?  Should we at least think about this?</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Other questions abound.  Maybe we should think about the enormous power exercised by platforms like Facebook and YouTube as a result of “network effects.”  Cf.  <em>Ohio</em> v. <em>American Express Co.</em>, <a aria-label=\"585 U.S. 529\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/585/529\">585 U.&nbsp;S. 529 (2018)</a>.  And maybe we should think about the unique ways in which social-media platforms influence public thought.  To be sure, I do not suggest that we should decide at this time whether the Florida and Texas laws are constitutional as applied to Facebook’s News Feed or YouTube’s homepage.  My argument is just the opposite.  Such questions should be resolved in the context of an as-applied challenge.  But no as-applied question is before us, and we do not have all the facts that we need to tackle the extraneous matters reached by the majority.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Instead, when confronted with the application of a constitutional requirement to new technology, we should proceed with caution. While the meaning of the Constitution remains constant, the application of enduring principles to new technology requires an understanding of that technology and its effects.  Premature resolution of such questions creates the risk of decisions that will quickly turn into embarrassments.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">IV</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> Just as NetChoice failed to make the showing necessary to demonstrate that the States’ content-moderation provisions are facially unconstitutional, NetChoice’s facial attacks on the individual-disclosure provisions also fell short.  Those provisions require platforms to explain to affected users the basis of each content-censorship decision.  Because these regulations provide for the disclosure of “purely factual and uncontroversial information,” they must be reviewed under <em>Zauderer</em>’s framework, which requires only that such laws be “reasonably related to the State’s interest in preventing deception of consumers” and not “unduly burde[n]” speech.  471 U.&nbsp;S., at 651.<a aria-label=\"reference 57 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-57\" id=\"CONCUR_8-57ref\"><sup><strong>57</strong></sup></a></p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\">&nbsp; For <em>Zauderer </em>purposes, a law is “unduly burdensome” if it threatens to “chil[l] protected commercial speech.”  <em>Ibid.</em>  Here, NetChoice claims that these disclosures have that effect and lead platforms to “conclude that the safe course is to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not exercis[e] editorial discretion at all” rather than explain why they remove “millions of posts per day.”  Brief for Respondents in No. 22–277, at 39–40 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> Our unanimous agreement regarding NetChoice’s failure to show that a sufficient number of its members engage in constitutionally protected expression prevents us from accepting NetChoice’s argument regarding these provisions.  In the lower courts, NetChoice did not even try to show how these disclosure provisions chill each platform’s speech.  Instead, NetChoice merely identified one subset of one platform’s content that would be affected by these laws: billions of nonconforming comments that YouTube removes each year.  49 F.&nbsp;4th, at 487; see also Brief for Appellees in &nbsp;No. 21–12355 (CA11), p. 13.  But if YouTube uses automated processes to flag and remove these comments, it is not clear why having to disclose the bases of those processes would chill YouTube’s speech.  And even if having to explain each removal decision would unduly burden YouTube’s <a aria-label=\"US Constitution first Amendment \" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment\">First Amendment</a> rights, the same does not necessarily follow with regard to all of NetChoice’s members.</p>\n<p class=\"casct jy-both\"> NetChoice’s failure to make this broader showing is especially problematic since NetChoice does not dispute the States’ assertion that many platforms already provide a &nbsp;notice-and-appeal process for their removal decisions.  In fact, some have even <em>advocated</em> for such disclosure requirements.  Before its change in ownership, the previous Chief Executive Officer of the platform now known as X went as &nbsp;far as to say that “all companies” should be required to explain censorship decisions and “provide a straightforward process to appeal decisions made by humans or algorithms.”<a aria-label=\"reference 58 of Alito Concurrence\" class=\"footref\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-58\" id=\"CONCUR_8-58ref\"><sup><strong>58</strong></sup></a>  Moreover, as mentioned, many platforms are already providing similar disclosures pursuant to the European Union’s Digital Services Act.  Yet complying with that law does not appear to have unduly burdened each platform’s speech in those countries.  On remand, the courts might consider whether compliance with EU law chilled the platforms’ speech.</p>\n<h3 class=\"jy-center\">*  *  *</h3>\n<p class=\"casct-d jy-both\"> The only binding holding in these decisions is that NetChoice has yet to prove that the Florida and Texas laws they challenged are facially unconstitutional.  Because the majority opinion ventures far beyond the question we must decide, I concur only in the judgment.</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<h3 class=\"fnheader\">Notes</h3>\n<p class=\"footnote\" id=\"CONCUR_8-1\"><a aria-label=\"back to text of Alito Concurrence at reference 1\" class=\"fnflag\" href=\"#CONCUR_8-1ref\">1</a> &nbsp;J.
