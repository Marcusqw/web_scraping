MONTGOMERY COUNTY Supreme Court 'text' content area TOP Statement SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES LISA PRICE, as personal representative of the ESTATE OF NICKIE MILLER v. MONTGOMERY COUNTY, KENTUCKY, et al. on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit No. 23\u2013649. Decided July 2, 2024 The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. Statement of Justice Sotomayor Nickie Miller was charged with murder based on the false confession of a witness. The witness later recanted her coerced confession, including in jailhouse letters she sent to her husband. Upon learning about the letters, a court ordered the witness to retrieve and turn them over to Miller\u2019s defense team. The lead prosecutor on Miller\u2019s case, Keith Craycraft, instead allegedly encouraged the witness to destroy the letters in response to the court order. The witness destroyed the letters instead of turning them over. Miller spent two years in prison before the State dropped the charges against him. Miller then sued Craycraft and others under Rev. Stat. \u00a71979, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 , for malicious prosecution, fabrication and destruction of evidence, due process violations, and conspiracy. The District Court dismissed the claims against Craycraft, concluding that he had absolute immunity as a prosecutor. The Sixth Circuit agreed, but noted that Craycraft\u2019s \u201csuccessful pressuring of [the witness] to destroy her jailhouse correspondence\u201d was \u201cdifficult to justify and seemingly unbecoming of an official entrusted with enforcing the criminal law.\u201d 72 F. 4th 711, 720 (2023). Miller now asks this Court to decide whether absolute immunity is available under \u00a71983 when, as here, a prosecutor knowingly destroys exculpatory evidence and defies a court order. Pet. for Cert. i. The Court\u2019s denial of certiorari should not signal tolerance of the prosecutor\u2019s conduct. 1 The allegations, assumed true at this stage of the case, tell a disturbing story. Prosecutors are \u201crepresentative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done.\u201d Berger v. United States , 295 U. S. 78 , 88 (1935). The prosecutor\u2019s conduct in this case \u201cdiminishes the dignity of our criminal justice system and undermines respect for the rule of law.\u201d Calhoun v. United States , 568 U. S. 1206 , 1208 (2013) ( Sotomayor, J. Prosecutorial immunity can promote \u201cthe vigorous and fearless performance of the prosecutor\u2019s duty.\u201d Imbler v. Pachtman , 424 U. S. 409 , 427 (1976). This immunity has limits, however. For example, absolute immunity does not apply \u201cwhen a prosecutor gives advice to police during a criminal investigation, when the prosecutor makes statements to the press, or when a prosecutor acts as a complaining witness in support of a warrant application.\u201d Van de Kamp v. Goldstein , 555 U. S. 335 , 343 (2009) (citations omitted). 2 It is difficult to see how the conduct alleged here, including destruction of evidence to thwart a court order, \u201crequire[s] legal knowledge and the exercise of related discretion,\u201d id ., at 344, or is \u201cintimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process,\u201d Imbler , 424 U. S., at 430. Even when absolute prosecutorial immunity applies, it \u201cdoes not leave the public powerless to deter misconduct or to punish that which occurs.\u201d Id ., at 429. Prosecutors accused of misconduct may still face criminal liability or \u201cprofessional discipline.\u201d Ibid .; see also Connick v. Thompson , 563 U. S. 51 , 66 (2011) (\u201cAn attorney who violates his or her ethical obligations is subject to professional discipline, including sanctions, suspension, and disbarment\u201d). Yet, these safeguards are effective only if employed. 3 Craycraft\u2019s alleged misconduct of advising a witness to destroy evidence to thwart a court order is stunning. If this is what absolute prosecutorial immunity protects, the Court may need to step in to ensure that the doctrine does not exceed its \u201c \u2018quite sparing\u2019 \u201d bounds. Buckley v. Fitzsimmons , 509 U. S. 259 , 269 (1993). Otherwise, we risk leaving \u201cvictims of egregious prosecutorial misconduct without a remedy.\u201d Michaels v. McGrath , 531 U. S. 1118 , 1119 (2001) ( Thomas, J. , dissenting from denial of certiorari). Notes 1 The Court may deny certiorari for many reasons, including that the facts presented by a petition do not clearly or cleanly implicate a division of authority among the lower courts. See this Court\u2019s Rule 10. 2 Absolute prosecutorial immunity in theory is limited to \u201cthe immunity historically accorded . . . at common law and the interests behind it.\u201d Imbler , 424 U. S., at 421; but see Kalina v. Fletcher , 522 U. S. 118 , 132 (1997) (Scalia, J., concurring) (\u201cThere was, of course, no such thing as absolute prosecutorial immunity when \u00a71983 was enacted\u201d). Further, as Judge Nalbandian discussed in his opinion below, recent scholarship details that the 1871 Civil Rights Act included language abrogating common-law immunities that was, for unknown reasons, omitted from the first compilation of federal law. 72 F. 4th 711, 727, n. 1 (CA6 2023) (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\u201cSo, according to this recent scholarship, because the Civil Rights Act of 1871 explicitly abrogated the common-law immunities grounded in state law, those immunities are abrogated now sub silentio under the current version of \u00a71983\u201d (citing Rogers v. Jarrett , 63 F. 4th 971, 980 (CA5 2023) (Willet, J., concurring)); Civil Rights Act of 1871, 17 Stat. 13 ; A. Reinert, Qualified Immunity\u2019s Flawed Foundation, 111 Cal. L. Rev. 201, 235 (2023)). This new scholarship reinforces why, at a minimum, this immunity doctrine should be employed sparingly. 3 See, e . g ., R. Barkow, Organizational Guidelines for the Prosecutor\u2019s Office, 31 Cardozo L. Rev. 2089, 2094 (2010) (observing that \u201ccriminal actions against prosecutors who willfully violate a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights . . . are almost never brought,\u201d \u201c[n]or are prosecutors typically punished by their supervisors or removed from office\u201d).
